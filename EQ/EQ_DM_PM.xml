                                4DX has more than 3D effects like wind, rain, scent etc. ... The screen of 4DX is not so big, although bigger than the normal theatres and RealD is offered as a 3D viewing technology. IMAX has much more larger screen and way better visual quality and sound of course.
                                        4DX - 
                                                screen is just too small
                                                        So it never really fills enough of your visual field to give the effect of actually being there
                                                        cropped screen for jurassic park, choppy image
                                                        designed it for every audience. What about the people who would be sitting in front row, how would they be able to watch it and enjoy.

                                                        supposed to immerse you in the movie actually detracts you - gets annoying after a certain time
                                                                chairs move a lot during action sequences and you will not be able to concentrate on screen
                                                                rare but have seen people throwing up during the show
                                                        For wonder woman, it did do wonders - can't say the same for "The Mummy" - legs in the air when rats attack.
                                                                first 4DX viewing (Avengers Infinity War) was so compelling that I watched Ant-Man and the Wasp in 4DX instead of IMAX.
                                                                        Civil War and I was blown away by 4DX

                                                no interval and you can't take any food in the hall
                                                IMAX 4DX 3D offers the best of all the above
                                        IMAX
                                                IMAX technology uses IMAX cameras, sound system, and IMAX projectors
                                                        Indian Multiplexes are showing all the regular films in their IMAX screens - people dissatisfaction comes.
                                                huge screen and super high res display
                                                3D effect is much more profound
                                                Sound lot louder and crisper

                                                basically the same
                                                IMAX screen is bigger and curved, so that the image really fills your field of vision.
                                                        feel like your in the movie

                                IMAX theaters are same like a PVR, INOX and CINÃ‰POLIS. (Imax is technology too) - PVR and Inox are hit in india.
                                        PVR revolutionized the multiplex industry in India - state of art screens, cinema screens, outstanding audio visual effects, luxurious seating,
                                        PVR has much bigger screens than INOX multiplexes
                                        comfortable seating system than INOX - plush, comfortable and adjustable
                                        better surround sound while watching movies than INOX
                                        incredible picture quality
                                        PVR Cinemas owns 113 multiplexes & 519 screens across 46 cities in India, whereas INOX boasts of 107 multiplexes & 420 screens across 57 cities 
                                        higher share of Hollywood & 3D content ranks at top, INOX follows it with a small margin
                                        more expensive than latter
                                        food second priority at PVR - PVR earns more
                                        adding food courts, games like bowling & more, INOX is more focused on parking and other
                                        normal 2D film, in any multiplux it is same experience to watch
                                        some movies are shooted with IMAX 3D that movies are highly prefer to watch in IMAX LARGE SCREEN
                                        PVR and INOX are screens pretty good when you watch a 3D movies; screen dulls in others on putting goggles.

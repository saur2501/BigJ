					It's empty- whatever you want you can fill.
					Should come only when invited. who invited you to earth- came to earth.
						I would have punched if I was not wearing new watch.

			mein jhut bolta tha- mein kaam pe jaa rahaa hoon- dhoop mein standing.
			joke sunao- devar bhabhi ka sambandh hi hassi mazak walla hota hia.
		I will do test- andar karwa dungi if wrong results- I am minister.
			Siddhu saab I thought you speak- your wife is kamaal- hamein mudde pe nahi aane de rahe.
			I must say I have busy day- I have to go make boats in rain streams.
			apple a day keep doctor away.
			kiss in public. once more- she was going to hit me while I rotated.
		pinky poo or hariyaali chhai- ever to you aaj laal kila lag rahi ho.
			never says- no first 6 months it was.
			ye hain impress, mera dilli ka address, amritsar ka address.
			why so many girls behind siddhu saab? cuz kapil wants to see- I don't get to.
				he has rollers under the chair- or laughting rotates
				overacting someone.
			kapil sharma namaste- pura bolo kapil sharma show namaste.
			what use is time- home works on money.

		We studied thru same university- crossed more.
			Why no album b4? Father used to beat and teach- kushti liked.
			no cassette- e1 will listen at home- and no1 will call us.
			sangeet thru rabb ko paa liya hua hai.
			I know only punjabi- hindi mixes then khicadi.
			chain toot gayi- chain se baith gayaa.
			Cycle instead car- then will not meet you.
			Car from 4 sides- if aag lag jaaye nikalna kahaan se hai.
			not sing in front of mike- it sucks sound.
			gaate hue 3rd manjil tak pahunch jaata hoon- meherbaani of superior, saints- khurak bhi hogi kucch? your ashirvaad.
			thand bahut thi- maine 10-15 minute mein wo bhi garam kar li.
				mujhe bistra hi garam karwate ho.
				chay bhi nahi pilayi- peeni to nahi hai- taa hi te bolli hai.
			remembered another incident of chay- aao to sahi- mai chala gayaa- pona ghanta baitha. No tea came.
				chay lene gayaa hai- majj chon gayaa hai.
				b4 leaving, chay nahi peeni- bete tumhare ghar mein guest khud banate hain chay.
			now remembered incident on milk.
				oye, mere liye nahi laaya- mein gurudware ka banda hoon.
				no TV, no Chitthi only riyaaz at home.
				you are guru you get padmashri; if not, then I will not take. Will give to another- take it.
				oye, ruk jaao- baat kaise hai. Bakre banata tha- dozen children- then waht time would make bakre.
				yaar, achhi nahi banee, oye holi bolo- bhabhi will stop asking- say, it;s good.
				tea very nice- sugar is less- what you thought- he had diabetes.
			ek ispar bhi sunaa doon- paaji suna do..suna doo
				child and named buddhu- I will run away and change my name- went way to mumbai.
				what's your age? Now what you will do with it!
				my friend- I won't request, akhiyan udeek diyaan ho jaaye.
				Proposed Kapil to sing- he refused! It would be demeaning them. Thus, insulting himself also.
			Love like no1 can cry you. Sing as if sound of atma and dance as if no1 is watching you.
		My patients and distributing music.
			Distribute lees- you will get lighter head.
			I will throw glucose bottle on your face.
			Carrying on role- but etiquettes maintained- touched feet in sequence.
			ashirvaad ka change lagega.
			kaan ki jagah- naak pe kya haath maar rahe the- smell aati thi.
			sangeet mein rasgulle- both have rasgulle- mausammi mein bhi ras (juice) hota hai
				same same ho gayaa- wo to bache ko kehte hain.
			aise doctor hakim the. You gave medicine- no! then how he died.
			We put mouth organ in his mouth- aa he wants to say but sound comes out cuz of that.
			I have to go- the patient who got engagement should not eat all the laddus. What a busy day- gotta eat laddus also.
			matlab matlab- matlabi kahin ke. Kyun itna? I want to kushti- Plz take care- machhar na lad jaaye kahin tumhe.
				Kushti karta hai- is daav kaise karte hain.
				Don't do pehelwaani- you do rest as much as posssible.
			they come out like frogs come out in rainy.
		ye saarangi main murli.
			jalota ne lota mara; mehendi ne mehendi; mika singh ne singh
			you divide eth- do you divide money notes also into pieces
				if I am to give a punch- will you take half half.
			awwaz sun kar mein diwaana hua tha- bachao bachao
			give a song- we will take money- he will give.

                                Hi john, hi abrahim, can't contain in 1- he said I danced with your bahu.
                                        no you can't joke with CM's relative- Jacquililne Fadnavis.
                                        you can become Jacquiline Gulati you may become- he is stretching under stretcher.
                                        you are so big- that our dhyan is on you only.
                                if he falls then milk ka milk, water ka water- yes, I did lift motorcycle but you are truck so I will need help.
                                        you are tricking- you have khwahish or not.
                                        uttha ke rakh lo. My patient said bhabhi but didn't say I was bhaiyya.
                                        Ok nahi chedta but they didn't have to be so beautiful also no
                                        You beat otherwise, I had given life for you.
                                        sach bolun aapse maar khane mein mazza bhi aa rahaa tha.
                                baj rahaa hai- yea, real phone- same home you live right.
                                        they don't know value.

                Tu aaya kyun nahi- main atak gayaa tha- teri awaaz?- nahi, katak gaya tha.
                        wahan bhatak gaya tha.
                        Ungli pakad ke chala kar- apni ungli pakdi to thi- fir bhi bhatak gayaa.
                        Main tralia challa gayaa tha- kahaan? dadar.
                        I have come after a long time- you will take chay or biscuit- No, I should ask- then why you didn't.

                                what learnt- it's better be late.
                                you come- I don't fear love but fear slap.
                                Nth happens by 1 slap- then you eat.

                                kaan nahi pakadne ka? to kya pakdu? kuch nahi izzat kharab hoti hai in tone changed.
                                aadha hissa chahiye jaydaad ka- do matthiyaan muh pe maar iske.
                                ghar pe nahi dar rahaa bahar kya darenge.
                                bhai banaa hun- log sudharne mein tu bigadne mein.
                                mein area ka bhai hoon- iski behen ka naam area hai.
                                har jagah murga- I have come to world to become a murga?
                                HOw sabak sikhaun- Chandan is name- agarbatti naam lagta hai- chandan hatela- phatela- seeing your face he said.

                        You so thin- optical illusion.
                                You be here. I think I will settle here.
                                You do film- I will do here- muhalla basaa nahi show cheenne waale aa gaye.
                                kamar tutne ki naubat aa jaati hai- dubara.
                                why late? muhurta or sony waiting. This time it will hit.
                                Michael Mishra- Names- ghanta singh, jo bhi karva lo, etc- I think shaitani dimag ki upaj (feels good)
                                comic timing- tapori roles- why? Acchi movie hai- but my acchi movies don't work.
                                All roles seem to be made seeing you- I feel insulted. I did circuit, etc.
                                you doing roles with him- peecha hi nahi chod raha- some competition? no I am only good actor- he is good human- friend.
                                Behind success of man is woman's haath- mine is laath- go to work!
                                ban rahe the sher- with wife- unt pahad ke neeche.
                                You will know how I am at home- arshad bhai is our brother- can keep standing but bhabhi should sit.
                                No the ones with manners- I am softening for the kill- this was bouncer for english.
                                        speak english in syllabus. I have many friends but Rohit my best friend. same for best father.
                                        anything you don't know- he knows eth but not why he left rajya sabha.
                                        mariya likes you- I asked Maria you like me- No, ok sorry ran from there.
                                        But her body language says yes. adhe beer mein saari asliyat bahar aai
                                Comedy it takes to be liked- "I like you" oh you are so funny.
                                        that's bcuz you ask money later- professionally hasate ho.
                                        Why you call your sweet wife as kadak singh.
                                                you know this show they call you to get talaq.
                                                meine kya bigada hai tumhara?

                                                he is going to sit- takes the shape- maybe you don't wash clothes.
                                                our show is romantic- that men do romance in face of female. you were choreographer.
                                                bacche bolenge- ulti ganga beh rahi hai- mere baap ke haath ka khaana.
                                                        Angrej ppl can't use spicy- bcuz they use tissue paper- zyada masala aag pakad leta hai.
                                                        Rajma by angrej- we taste from home- we enjoy- they can't won't have spice.
                                                        they would cook for photo and we would eat immediately.
                                Pati ki aadat change karna chahte hain
                                        pati change karna chahte hain- ghode ke 2 aur- he is table fan his name.
                                        he ran car on dividor seeing a woman. sundarta admire karne ke liye hoti hai.
                                        yes, but don't run car on divider! Do they look back- they do.
                                        He sees all women equally (with lust)- lovers college- so founder must have been...
                                        Lal chadi maidan khadi- madam you are gorgeous- bahar nikal!
                                        beta wait for 6 months- she will say sleep in toilet- she is with you? why bhai ki khushi dekhi nahi jaa rahi?
                                                tabhi khul ke bol rahe hain. I don't see kami- I love her.
                                                Nari was always bhaari and Nara was always aabhaari.
                                                now our masiha- siddhu paaji= ask him- "yes anybody ask me- it's true"
                                        What non-sense on face? huh, don't know fashion!
                                                ye glow karti hai- ye to aata hai- gobhi waala chaata?
                                                when actor and producer talk- critic shouldn't talk.
                                                he is cheater- in film took real phere around with me.
                                                4 baar manaya- 4 bacche ho gaye. kaise manate ho? we 2 are wet in rain. And river is flowing- above critical point? and you are flowing away.
                                                        and announcement- don't go ahead you will die.
                                                        arshad teach him- how to do? I am naraz (then should go away from him) with you- I did some mistake? Mein maan gayee.
                                                        dusre ki biwi ko koi bhi manaa leta hai- apni ko manana hota hai! How you do or like me? In our house is opposite- she says I did sth- I say maan gayaa.
                                                        per nahi dabwaane- then go inside- saw my fear!
                                                        Said- jhadu do- meine kahaa- mein? Meine jaale utaar diye lekin jhadu nahi maara.
                                                From gadwaal- whole ghadwaal has come
                                                        Arshad- should biwi go with you on film shoot? depends on whose biwi it is.
                                                                tour ke liye saath mein jaana chahiye- 
                                                                She wakes up at 3 why? to smoke bidi. I smoke bidi for your brother- so that macchar go away.
                                                                I say causes cancer- but doesn't understand.
                                                        Our face has become like this- jal jal ke hua hai.
                                                                husband has given heart to shukla
                                                                you cleaned tears? no, just nose.
                                                                in fields? see and whistle- I see (that with matka on head) scare crow in field.
                                                                        you also no less- just have life in there- if you stand in field like that- many crows would scare away never to turn.
                                                                        taali maaregi? funny bola to?
                                                                        She said- you do tit for tat- he didn't listen- but some ppl took it seriously- jhadu waala to serious ho gayaa tha.
                                                                        Chitthe kahaan khol rahe hain- tum khulwa rahe ho
                                                                Husband frustrated with what aadat of wives?
                                                                        baat karke- maaraa maari se koi faayda nahi
                                                                        kappu tissue for wife issue.
                                                                        aapse hamari - dhamki bhari guzaarish hai- shaant ho jaao.
                                                                        came in front of screen- this has become live now.
                                                                        When last he spoke a lie? Hmmm... so frequent that i can remember when last he spoke truth.
                                                                        inko koi aisi baat yaad aai jisse inko akele ko mazza aaya.
                                                                                first where's your neck?
                                                                        whistle close to ears.
                                                        Paan laaiye- bahut udhaar ho gayaa!- And entertainment you got by seeing me- the beer ka nasha hua- uska kya- that's worth 85 Rs- gimme!
                                                                hamse paise loge- paan ke hi paise le rahe hain- kisi aur cheez ke thode hi!

                                                                        you also chuna lagaa rahe ho- saari pehen ke logon ko.

                                                        Interview kharab kar diya- nahi abhi to baaki hai kharab karna.

                        some power ki pati can control sth- no such power.
                        why husbands interest in wife's friends and not vv- tell so many faults that don't delight in meeting.
                        Usko lagaa tha- women is always right. to aapko nahi pataa tha.
                        so many responsibilities- seriously they handle. God's gift.

                        where is doctor gulati- mar gya wo, don't call him.

                        khadi kyun hai bhaag lijiye. belly dance nahi bail dance- damodar dance academy taught sth wrong.
                                Look better in beard- so want to say sth to you- shave the tiger.
                        you should not have made romantic scene- janata has rosh for the kissing scene.

                        Why sad? You have husband as hero- mine is not zero- less- it's in minus.
                        4 pipeline milega- lifeline- aisa hai kya?

                        I am such expert- chalti bus se utar jaata hun.
                                mein gaali sikhataa- hoon- paise maange- gaali deke bhaag gaye.
                        I childhood my mom would whisle and I peed. Now for 20 mins I had been but nth- I was cheated.
                arora- rora zyada hain.
                        I saw bimar lomdi- looked great with him.
                        dog- I was drinking with him.

                                I have seen many C grade movies- no story but still mazza aata hai- person manages to see their face but your face is intolerable.
                        Have you come as expert or give history chapter on my face
                                tere face ko jail banti hai.
                                sir pe daal galta hai
                                I like that your ad of aam- 1 that falls on lips- very sweet it was.
                                I will go away from here- where? with you, where you take- I will take to baar baar dekho movie.

                kaun kehta hai mujhe accha nahi lagega
                Ubala aalu on head- 
                baccha khajur- baap shakkar gandi shakal waala (exploit yamak to make a point)
                bacche- kapdo se- hair se nahi (get a few attribs to be the entity type)
                mere paas mat aayiye mein maan jaaungi (expectations swirl around)
                You like my dance- suraj se sunny- Kapil se funny- I feel insulted (speak truth boldly)
                Don't be judge you will select me and talented won't be selected (talk consequence)
                Hamare saath kucch purane chal rahe hain- sabke saath chal rahe hain.
                Koi flirt kare to mein bhaag jaata hoon (tu ser mein sava ser- change the vector)
                geeta maa- jaa ke baap bhi le aayiye (yamak as normal)
                Any candidate- good dance she cries, bad, eliminate- I don't know I feel you do satta on candidates.
                Koi accha dance kare- she starts to cry- your own child doesn't do good dance.
                He is 4 but doesn't know dance- maybe at 18 he becomes emraan hashmi.
                Physics mein PhD- when saw murder. Why physics? plan B.

                        He says best sher for me- 
                        SHe is so habituated- america 7 is dancing- she goes gives them number.
                        Seriously tell me- what feels better- coreographical superstars or sitting and earning.
                        Siddhu paaji- aise- The best job is yours on earth.
                Anyone ever said you ma and seeing another child as papa- aap maan jaao- ho jaayega.
                        You are joking- I will get serious.
                        E1 who comes on show have sth in love life going on- that makes no difference to you.
                        Main to is darr se haan bol deta hoon- candidate kahin na bol de- uncle aap dance karke batao.
                        Little dance- robot dance- bade logon ka itna hi kaafi hai.
                Sir, you sit relaxed- you can keep your big pet here.
                        She is so thin- has some organs missing from inside.
                        This show will be hit- cuz their niyat is good- how you know you had taken udhaar from them.
                        Laughter of person- yahi ladki kandhe pe sir rakh le phir kuch nahi.
                        Gita- I have a question- aap pe haath rakh ke kisi ne kasam khaai hai.

                                In Barfi, you gave no voice to ranbir, priyanka special child- then in coming time, you may make comedy show host into romantic star.
                                jitni tagdi you do your own promotion- none else- where will I go.
                                Laughing too much- mujhe apni kursi khatre mein lagti hai- Hastehaste kisi pe gir na jaana.

        So? challenge. 
        Mosquitoes bit yesterday- they were females so didn't mind- they also knew it's Ranbir
        Sorry for trouble but you enjoy also so much- 2 actress- must have given discount to director.
        Why he said working with director is partying- why he gives liquor- you know directors empty minds but acting that not idle- enjoy then energy translates on reel.
                vs Cultivating mood with head down- try raise and director signals to put it back
                Karan dances and makes faces on sets- once saw him multi-tasking.
                He is director, producer, model- he was actor also but did bombay velvet.
                He wanted ppl to forget his first DDLJ (award hungry) but after Bombay velvet- reminded e1 of DDLJ
                Naainsaafi- saari of shifon in cold shooting area; not feel chill?
                        I trained my mind to think it's fine- while shivering; that guy eth covered came close and said it's close to prank- I became so angry that body became hot- it was social service.
        Karan acts as female enaction? Practice with Hero enacting me.
                see photoshoot- introducing director; full feel he takes; see more than heroine.
                Nawazuddin role- Sohail gave romantic and he started rejecting other movies- khoon lag gayaa hai mooh- aapka bhi kuchh?
                        I wish he doesn't join romantic- we also need sth. Normal face- it has udaasi- just see! Fun roles- I don't laugh.
                        Tell a joke- comedian in front he should- ever heard 7 ask sachin- sixer maar ke dikhao na- Army ko top chalaa ke dikhao naa.
                        Siddhu- 7 woke me up in morning said hans ke dikhao- o pare jaao! 4:15 baje.
                        gadhe jaise hasta hoon- it's like hydrolic brake.
        So, this is your first movie right? (bombay velvet was first?)- they smile!- actually I didn't see that one- who did?
                He said this- meri story I will say anything. I did workout- No, you didn't else I would remember (exposing your anartha)
                as actor there's a comfort I feel with him- respect. roz kyun nahi karte.
                In that song, all have headphone- same song e1 dancing or e1 their own! It's a new concept- silent disco- pager type- 4 channels- seer sees mad ppl.
        When we are in Karan's home- with friends. Why friends- sth wrong happens if alone- we make teams ... teams. gotta?
                we are picked last for dumb-chetaz- why did you tell this at all (insult yourself- ask why?)
                I like her- she enjoys her own self. World Entertainment level has come so down that I have to- 
                        you mean show not good? jis thaali mein khaa rahi hai, usi mein thook rahi hai?
                Ye sharmaon ka show hai- A joke has fallen flat- and you in low voice personally say- Bas, bas, bas!
        Rockstar roles he plays- like you like singing besides comedy.
                make 7 conscious- aur karo naa baatein khud mein we are liking it.
                You are facing that side- he other- are we sitting on bus stop?
        While partying she likes being around drunkards (not herself tho)- gossips leak out.
                lives a grin- rehne do. when ppl lose control, I got to express myself fully.
                He is AIR of bollywood- not comfortable secret- philosophize- there are no secrets- e1 has someone who they know won't tell to anyone and so on.
                So I don't tell anyone- I come to know thru your driver.
                He is dog and I am his human. Dogs must be going- this is my Ranbir Kapoor.
        Koi gossip nahi chal rahi tumhari- movie bhi to nahi aa rahi- What's going on- Karan Johar...wait! his movie is coming.
                Enter some heroine numbers in my mobile- Why you doing such things in old age- I have always been doing- only noticed now!
                Anushka's fan- you bowl good spin. I saw facebook tweet in instagram.
                Samajh mein to ye nahi aa rahaa, isne cricket seekha kahaan se.
                I want to hug you- bahut ho gayaa huggna wuggna. Ispe to hug ka hak banta hai.
                Thank you so much sir- Thank you kis baat ka; ab to mujhe paise chahiye (or paise kaa settlement baad mein kar lenge)
                yaad nahi I used to be neighbor- haan haan haan, kuchh yaad nahi hai.
        You asked shaving cream for mother- lipstick for father- yeah, I don't remember.
                where were you? I became P for hospital
                I came cuz ranbir my husband- I want Talaq, Talaq, Talaq- how talaq without shaadi- what's your proof? it's in school.
                But you said married 6 months- paper work was done b4
                Haath nahi pakadna mera- thand hai ishara samjho. Aap to yahi chahte ho na mera muffler tumhe mil jaaye
                crying- side ho jaao- vomit karne lagi hai- you didn't meet for 6 months, why vomit.
                Break up you cry, she danced in the movie.
                ye dil ya dimag se nahi pet se sochti hai- if she fasts for 1 day- India would fulfill all its nedds of food deficit
                        khaana khaane ki jagah maar na kha lena- I am vegetarian, I don't eat it.
                Darkhwast karna- mat kiya karo, thook favvara banke udta hai. Kucch Kucch hota hia- kuchh nahi hua- muder dekhke hua.
                aisi ladkiyah phool waale ke saath bhaag jaati hain.
                WHy love triangle- See circle asking.

                    Jokes are decorative expression of your natural responses- here I became vulnerable when 1st half was spoken- take a clear stand and establish it beautifully and hilariously.
                    You can convince a laughing man more easily!!
            CS is talk about class (entity type) but Eg is entity/instance
                    REL means eg for behavior, action or verb and Eg means noun, CS means specific cases (still abstract) of general principle

                    I was his student- we are tampering with what's most important in his life- science.
                    You don't remember me from science camp but you taught me a lot- sustained fusion, fission reaction, neuro-chemical fusion- what about fusion reaction of super collider- I read all your papers- parker sees in space (to prove universal quantifier- prove negation of existential)
                            You never wrote that- you were testing me? and you passed.

                                Freak, anyone can have accident.
                                Spiderman, you are making career of interference- career? no salary, no vacations. to speak nth of on the job health hazards (hypothetical views)
                        My chemicals, my power, I have to deactivate some of those arms.
                what happened doc, glued to magnet in dynamo; you lame brain. rocket engine will fire on top of us.
                        double jeoparady- full fury of octavius or molecules of friends- that's what I love about life, choices! (See positive side; stay cool)
                        don't like to interrupt egomaniac on role- but here's web for eyes.
                        get him close to magnet- hey, 6 armed neanderthal, why don't you come here fight like octopus (Psychology)
                        I can wait till your friends get fried.
                        Won't wait for your battery to fall also. trade your life's work with my friends.
                        Falicia embraces spiderman, how can i ever thank you- this looks like a pretty good way!! (Naughty)
                        Falicia- Parker you should know- I don't like to get hostage on first date- I respect that!
    Traits noteworthy
            smart superhero- good action- smart scientific moves, not brute power based.
            music is good (not variety but quality)- dialogues are humorous.
            substantiate with examples. that's why we studied in school.
            storyline is captivating- mostly personal fights with villains but all intended to serve kingpin's interests.

            I think spiderman is being deemed guilty- sorry, not my table.

                    with great power, comes great responsibility
                    all pics you took but not character rubbed off- never showed back when help was needed.
                    by stop being spiderman, who else will suffer.
            maybe he was born with glass bowl- just guessing.
            Beck incident- planned and crashed a copter
                    cheap suction- but works- his plans and holographic cubes tricks.
            Some of it is real and some is illusion- you decide what is what.
                    Well, they had nth to do with this- let them go- well, Jameson you can keep but..
                    Dinosaur is aluminium inside and spiderman caught in web- by the time you figure who is mysterio- I will have shot you- trusted spider sense.

            physics is lot like theater- gotta make sense outta life.
                    thanks, making me sense out of my life, uncle ben and spiderman too.

            I should have kept with falicia- web fluids, I love you.
            Mugger running- they don't look like running for their night school!!
            Hey, look there's spiderman- where? Where?- I get so flustered when I meet a celebrity.

            Spiderman to JJ- I will crush Parker if anymore pics- that too if I am in a good mood. and you get off my case.

                    Fire me if you want but i have a family to think about so i am landing the copter.

                    why dress so- the last thing my enemies see- symbol of fear/terror.
            Hobgoblin kidnaps hardey. The right thing but get hurt- how to live with myself.
                    he is devious, lyer and too ambitious- needed to advance in enterprise.

                    where he gets all these arsenals- happy trail spiderman.
                    you better tell me- it's personal- you made a deal; trusted- I could lose it all- eth could be lost.
                    what about your son- I said eth.
                    Now he has taken the ground too. Can't get rid of me that easily after doing it to aunt may.

                Tumhare Svaagat ke liye bomb- All flights are cancelled, hobgoblin.
                Face me- he hits- careful what you whisper spiderman.
                Hobgoblin destroys eth- he has 1 bomb left- uses to distract spiderman by attacking Harry. Escapes.
                Go ther web slinger- wall crawler. spiderman in lift escaping- can't it go faster- kingpin lets lift loose- worth the lifts making.
                We will never know where we were- he took a fall will be ok.

                MJ wants to go back to her aunt- seeing condition of Aunt May.

                    He meets me on roof on that building (chance to escape)- why meets at all- his camera pics in newspaper, I guess for PR.
                    You think he will show up with you standing as lawn furniture!!

                            shocker made wet, i will blow up- who told you wear flashy clothes!
                            Limelight falls on spiderman- moves aside- Sorry, I have never been one looking for limelight.

                        Old spiderman saves lady- thanks- it's nth we old folks need to stick together- I had no idea spiderman is senior citizen.
                                Vulture gets spiderman's problem- parker behaving as his uncle. 
                                old Parker gets parker's cloths as charity from aunt.

                        Darker world has made me more powerful- no.
                        YOu challenge me in my dimension- Ok, maybe this was not such a smart move after all.
                        MJ you must learn to face the truth as is- mordo seamlessly connects the emotional ties we have in lives. Let go of bitter memories.
                        You fight against dark- may vishanti look after you- and may your anklets never tickle.
                Make a wish
                        show demonstration and then explain what it is along with uses. organic but not inorganic.
                        Blast by octopus, I have a feeling this ain't part of presentation.
                        I am running but parker you stay for pictures- I will but chief purpose is different.
                        used inorganic cutting laser to attack octopus back
                                handicapped but still more than enough hands to carry on.
                        lot of money loss- by spiderman fights
                                World needs spiderman as much as I need him- I quit
                                If i was spiderman won't show my face again- could you send this fan letter to spiderman- not another one.
                                Now all I need is superhero pension and enjoy.
                        Who is it- another fortune teller- You were your enemy- Now sit- I prefer standing.
                        Embark on you- I embark on door to leave- You must overcome self pity that ends your career.
                                Why you need me- you have your powers- tendency to question yourself is tedious but interesting.
                                No thanks, I am not what you call a believer. Have a faith of child (the fan letter)- this kinda weird stuff is why I am quiting.
                        I have complete collection of spiderman- you know parker- st too well. sees a photo- that's when I thought I could use powers to make money.
                                you are from dying planet and came by spaceship?- timmy confused me with another- I am result of accident.
                                I was nobody in HSC- who are you?- I want to keep that to myself- but incident.
                                        Hey, will you go with me to science presentation- let me think; should I go to party and enjoy with flash thompson or science exhibition to bore with you; I just don't know; confusing!!
                                        what happened parker- my little demonstration made you upset- hallucinations; car made me jump beyond power- agility of spider.
                        Mistake of allowing crime and got personal trouble- web slinger is personal and biodegradable.
                                can't quit cuz you made 1 wrong choice- rebuild.
                                Remember you told me about agility- tadaa.
                                Is he telepathic- controlling agility- afraid of 1 on 1- stole from gendry- it's working-  he is losing focus.
                                spiderman will serve me- don't be so sure.
                                Spiderman- I must be some piece of work for that person to hate me so much.
                                you owe him- he would have helped you in trouble- you cna't tell me what I owe- I will sb who will help- I didn't say I won't
                                whatever you are freeze- sorry, did you say squeze.
                        Spiderman surrounded- Anyone of these weapons can turn me into spider paste- hey, gentlemen, maybe you are wondering why I called this meeting.
                                I don't know what to believe in- who is telling truth- belive in yourself- truth exists within you.
                                Is octopus defeated by the mere child- accept it doctor, these days children have no respect for elders.
                                why do I always find myself being a matchmaker between MJ and harry.
                                Green goblin not hobgoblin- but anyway it will matter only if you survive.
                                should I tell you cuz you saved my life once- twice but who's counting.
                                you spying on me- didn't you know curiosity killed the cat!
                                fighting busy- seems too busy- the court is adjourned. what are you here for? saving your ungrateful life.
                                I thought I had seen eth but this really gets the cake.
                        As long as she is in love with spiderman, I have nth- I am in competition with myself
                                science teacher- but there is more to life than moeny.
                                strange he deoesn't think that education is the key to survival- on- I have more important thiings to do than education.
                                hey kid, watch where you are goin!
                                haven't you had enough for a night- that must his way of saying no.
                                I bet when you go home removing the mask- you don't come to slums here. Life is survival here.
                                thanks man- don't mention it.
                                shortcircuited the gyroscope by understanding tis working. Science is imortant- a big wheel steered him in right direction after all.
                                e1 thought me a thief so I thought better become one- but at heart I am scientist.
                                spiderman hangs them- I wanted to hang with the home boys.

    <Season3>
        are you interested? you kidding, when do i start?
        just hold my hands- whose hands can support 10 ppl's hands or crush them in wink of eye (idiom taken literally- double meaning)
        parker was framed by kingpin to be guity of antinational involvements. 7 had made terrible mistake and 7 had to take a fall.
                attempted to be killed by suffocation until daredevil saves him- in world eyes, spiderman (chameleon) helped parker run away.
        you know what you can't leave my office cuz you are fired; parker says in chorus. I will never forget JJ.
        Spider sense for popcorn- gun held- are you tryin' tell me that it's bad for my cholesterol. (making sense in context)
                Arrested for disk- let's see what police has to say about this- we are police. it was fisk's security data.
                You know I won't spoil my country- you betta get a good lawyer.
                can't afford you- 7 paid it for you; until it runs out- I am your man if you want me. of course.
                Lawyer is blind- they say justice is also blind- that gives me an edge. (connecting links)
                In this not even spiderman can help- fisk was right, not even spiderman can do it- I am exhausted. (2 worlds in 2 minds- double meaning)
                this guy can have my spider power run for its money. I like daredevil's style (praise)
                        accident by radioactive while running in embarassment seeing father's criminal action for living- father tried to spy on kingpin but never seen.
                you take rest- to himself, but there is no rest for spiderman (attitude shines in words)
                I use lotta gutter- I am grateful never bitten by a radioactive rat (extrapolating- with emotions involved)
                why did you help fisk kidnap parker- he thinks i would kidnap me. (TRUTH)
                that's it I have had it- spiderman. 
        why you so interested in protecting parker thru disk- I like his work; he always shows my good side. (excuse)
                hate to leave you but not getting disk cooks parker. (roopak)
                this time I am helping- no1 can see thru smoke- some of us see world differently. (surprise at knowing more)
                Thanks for saving me- I was saving peter parker. what? you got the disk right? (TRUTH- kahin pe nigahe kahin pe nishana)
                this matter's investigation is over- now is capturing peter parker.
                king pin- how did spiderman know where to look for data. (others' algorithm curious)
                you are still fugitive- they will shoot first and question later.
                MJ's aunt- if i was peter parker- wild horses won't keep me away. MJ kisses parker- I didn't mean that- takes parker as doctor to aunt may.
                anna wattson raised spider sense- she must be really mad at me.
                his son gets cd as well as parker kidnapped- my son has cleaned your mess- i am touched- our relp is nth like one with my father- it occurs i know a little about it.
                        his father left him cuz of over-weight- this is the way life is, sacrifices need to be made. he comes outta jail and uses technology to wipe his criminal records and establishes his identity- only person who knew his past- was removed using same slogan.
                after all the risks I took, parker is gonna take the fall. Merry Lee who was chasing her superior attacks along with DD- time to even the odds.
                contingency plan- chameleon enters takes DD form- only real one knows handling the stick.
                keep the police busy while i finish the task- can you tell me where little spider room is.
                kingpin's child put behind bars along with chameleon. kingpin escaped the sight by distracting thru chameleon.
                don't you worry- behind this mask is a friend to fight kingpin to his end.
        Remember my yound child- it's not how to defeat enemies but why
                smith is using his memory to reprogram himself to kill osborne; fascinating- that's not the word i will use.
                what you did to smith- a mistep in furtherance of science.
                what a combination- bruce lee's moves and ipman's eyes. ready for big time?
                It seems spiderman can't do everything- no, but he can give a try.
                hey, you! we just doing car shopping anything against that- no time for test drive late night.
                tombstone enters house- i want to discuss with parker- i will call police- he plucks it out- be my guest!
                there is always sth urgent- we will talk.
                are you going to him for third time- what are you, a score keeper.
                Madam web- belief in human power- it's your brain that makes you superior- don't play physical game with tombstone.
                Robb's son gets to see who really cares! real family or criminal family. seduced into crime by tombstone buddies.
                he is not human but monster- he has done things that even post wouldn't print.
                hey police, do you love your job cuz the thief loves his.
                Rest in pieces spiderman. once again hero triumphs and greeting of city in his eyes (bombs sannnn)
                It must be madam web. doesn't surprise me- you are good at deducing what's obvious- ok, so you are insulting me. overcome fear and keep allies, keep friends close, enemies closer.
                        she wants to make a warrior- like I am fighting acme.
                hey, won't give me therapy, beautiful lady- at least goodnight kiss or fear a bite.
                        hey! I will eat you for breakfast- I will give you indigestion, man!
                        now that's a cheerful guy- well, cheer is not part of his job description any way.
                simbiant binds with anyone but only rage of addy brock could create venom.
                war machine. you were not invited, man iron- wrong, iron man is other guy but thanks for compliment.
                crushing you like tin can. simbiant same but different- it will reflect your hatred for humanity; lust for destruction.
                I must take it- it must take it- strongest carnage in land.
                he was laughing- spiderman blocks his mouth thru web saying it wasn't that funny.
                carnage- ready for some father son quality time; between there is little of spiderman left.
                        doing destruction- i don't like to be interrupted in meals;
                        it seems your life force ain't as useless as your life.
                these are human beings with illness- you make it sound like fly, doctor.
                        you dare follow us- what made you think you will live long enough- carnage is wellmerged with symbiant that he calls as i not we.
                        this is second time i owe you- who's keeping the count
                what are you preparing me for- a horror beyond belief- I am glad I asked
                        addy brock sacrifices for woman who tries to separate him from symbiant.
        accept my simple vehicle- thanks but sorry i can't- doctor where is your scientific curiosity; i have offer you can't refuse.
                spiderman overwhelmed falicia- sure he hasn't seen you for month- maybe give 7 more reliable a try.
                spiderman screwed up great parker in 5 mins
                MJ- tell parker that we are too busy for talk- MJ said...- I heard.
                you need manner- actually you do- why mysochist- maybe I need spot removers.
                Falicia to spiderman- are you avoiding me? avoiding you; look can't let there be between us- can't jeopardize yours.
                I am new kingpin- i doubt that; kingpin always keeps trumpcard- sylvia on gunshot.
                he said you will come if i stand long enough- I am sorry- for what?- for what i am gonna do to you
                you killed spiderman- those reports of my demise would be greatly exaggerated, so sorry.
                        i have waiting long for you- what you have in mind- pie winning contest.
                why would you help them- no gain in destroying planet- it's bad for business.
                what's matter spiderman, loosing grip on reality.
                I am cool as parker but spiderman is worried about dimensional accelerator.
                dictionary friend- doesn't say stealing gf- hey, i didn't- but you did and won't forgive.
                i have to make parker meet fiance- sorry, JJ social obligations.
                why my spider sense- of course, danger of being bored to death but there's hope of listening to their conversation.
                KP needs my help- demands- tell me who hobgoblin is- leave me alone- ok but can't promise the same about your son.
                this is crazy- i can't love 1 woman as peter parker and 1 as spiderman. don't have better offer- no, i don't just want you be happy- so do i.
                he must have hit me real hard- I am seeing double goblins.
                who wants old versions, goblin- I am new friend of osborne.
                am i late? not from your standards- ideosyncracies i have come to love- oh, the L word.
                You and MJ conspiring to be together- No, Mr Osborne you get it all wrong.
                fighting with parker- goblin- it seems clothes really do make a man.
        freeze say police- scorpion says melt while throwing his acid.
        scorpion looting bank- sorry scorpion you exceeded your withdrawl limit
                why do you show up ew I go- Hey, I am superhero, remember!
                finders keepers; this ring will look good on my fiance- adius, bug head! you are good insurance, old lady.
                green goof ball- only obsessee will hide behind old lady- better call your mother to fight here.
                aunt may screams to spiderman- stay away from me- she is more afraid of me than scorpion!
                your abondonment cause paranoia, you see betrayal everywhere. will dream stop.
                do i sense sth more than just friend. unsettling to give news of our marriage from 7 else. so personally telling. I never need hobgoblin, till now.
                JJ- I will pay for your marriage- really!- it's a war with fisk; don't worry you can pay me back over decades.
        I am not interested in your dramatic flair for names- tell me if it will do the job!
                there's an outrage- better outrage than obituary, let's leave from here.
                to robots, spidy calls- hey, tinhead, take this stone on your head. you were not guest list, spiderman says scorpion.
                do you take this lady as your wife, I do- do you take this... man as your husband- she does!
                we are friends hoping some day we will be more than friends.
                I am giving you gift fisk couldn't think of giving- you are right; tin can rolling with the cab.
                love was all that harry needed.
                can't you solve a prob yourself- only you can solve it.
        See, always thinking of himself the parker guy- anna, I am his wife now. Doesn't mean I have to like him now.
                world has forgotten the heroes (villain) I don't. They are powerful but need a general like me.
                what line of work you said you are in- listen pal- he has been getting around whole evening; he will make a good politician.
                Good that they haven't changed ventilation systems.
                Spiderman here? Good to be recognized; it helps my PR.
                surprised to see me big boy- hehe, delighted.
                are you ok- i will like to talk old times but first stop these goons.
                good for free travel
                Ok go to russia for story on spiderman's making global thru russia/ or working all along- but you don't get a story and I send you to siberia.
    </Season3>
    <Season5>
    Peter Parker about aunt's gift- she has budget- how can she manage to give me sth here
            wedding ring no- it's a gesture of giving happiness that we had.
            freeze- melt- sorry scorpion (in bank), you exceeded withdrawl limit.
            hey, you show up wherever I go- hey, I am superhero remember.
            he melts hinges to enter inside locker room of bank.
            let me go, you hideous man. this ring I will give to my gf (intention is clear). let it go- finders' keepers.
            didn't think so, bughead; you will let me go with old lady; adios. you are a good insurance lady. You will need it if don't give my rings- I like lady with spunk.
            if you wasn't busy, you will probably send your mother to fight for you.
            stay away from me- she is more afraid of me than scorpion
            I wonder what else will get thrown in my way.
    Dreams seem so real- in dreams, your subconsciousness tries to explain reality that can't be explained.
            why your best friend ended with peter. why peter played part in both disappearances.
            your life- you struggled with loneliness and now those take paranoia.
            You do have friends- only don't realize it. I worry for Harry- do I detect sth more than friends.
            Merry Jain tells about marriage- shocking- but I thought it would unsettling if came from anyone else.
            Dr Kafka says I need rest and be alone. Are you all right? I am fine liss (says without looking)
            I should not have come here- your not coming would have been worse.
            Why have you been shutting me out- I never needed you ....until now.
    Wilson Fisk- Spiderman's enemy wants to see me.
            Arranging details for why you shouldn't marry watson.
            Competition bought by fisk. I will sponsor your wedding- nothing personal but it's a war thing with fisk. You can always repay in installments.
            Fisk has already arranged a helicopter- unbelievable.
            This being green goblin paid in release- now, teach me more- start a new partnership.
            Silverman does partnership only to become stronger. Surprising you were green goblin- surprising silvermane had feud with king pin.
            how you know- same third party- remains anonymous. Silvermane has extra muscle- scorpion is you suit functioning properly- you fix real good smithe- meet my new assistant.
            Begin right away making robot- why rush- I have enemies to reduce to heap- Ready is goblin robo warrior- I am not interested in your dramatic flare for names smithe; can it do the job- what 1 can't; many can.
    I thought harry would get me ready but hey, ring is there- yes, hopefully didn't fall 2 mins since you asked.
            where have you been- overlookgin mother's business.
            Let's go attend a wedding robos- anyone has objection to marriage- I have it; she's gonna marry me, privately.
            gets aunt to safety and leaves for spiderman- I can't do it.
            This is an outrage- better outrage than obituary; let's leave.
            E1 leaves- this is nice and quiet as marriage should be.
            Scorpion- I didn't know you were on guest list, spiderman!
            I am harry- I know who I want Harry- Marry me now or I blast e1 to smitherine- priest faints- not now.
            Fisk starts megaslayer- This combination of silvermane with smithe and now osborne is bad for my biz- so let me deal with it. Stops spiderman.
            Scorpion- That's enough big boy- you corroses have no effect on robot- what about hit of tail- catches him and says this will help you figure out.
            marraige scene
                    do you take her for a wife- I do and do you take this....man for a husband- she does.
                    Better I blow up than see her in another's arms
                    Liss arrives- you remember your enemies but do you remember who your friends are!!
                    She loves Peter but won't stop her from having you as a friend- you confusing me; green goblin is my only friend.
                            I am your friend and hoping to be more than a friend but future has to begin now- take me away- I hate weddings anyway.
                            Spiderman can you get parker for me to proceed with wedding.
                    What car keys- coach keys- you are right JJ- fisk couldn't have thought of gift such as this.

    Six forgotten heros- chapter 1
            Commander kernel is waiting for you- this is most sophisticated lab- can't run without me- sorry for yanking outta retirement but sth that only you can do.
            This person can unleash a force that can stop all- may parker- German scientist hiding since WW2 (JJ had covered story)
            Aunt may moving with mrs wattson- to avoid loneliness that Peter Parker and MJ married. This is parental house- see, always thinks of himself.
            I am married to him- That doesn't mean I have to like him.
            Aunt May fainst on seeing a news that German scientist kidnapped. Peter guesses a news.
            Fisk after scientist- he has lots of secrets. Need chameleon for job- most impregnable jail he is in- nth can stop me.
            Planning insideous 6. Brought underground- world forgotten but not me- they need general like me to revive- mysterio's replacement is vulture. I accept your terms- you will like me here.
            You helping me wouldn't be worth if you sprained your back- ok aunt may it's easy job- slips over car toy. I have strength of spiderman but of course, agility needs a little practice.
            PP sees parents around world several times- why? Kemolo's visit- uncle ben's best friend. Looks like yesterday to meet PP. Why uncle ben never mentioned him.
            Which line of work you said you were in- he has been giving me run around all evening. He'd make a good politician.
    Did these belong to parents- put them away. Take a walk;let me deal alright- I will prefer crawling over walking.
            He has to know it. who knows how he can't handle- You are here to collect what you can't have.
            I am selling this house- but this is starting all over again. Spiderman chasing the guy reaching shield headquarters- doesn;t make sense- what's the connection.
            Jeez they haven't changed their ventilation system since last.
            Frustrating when ppl don't want to tell all they know- yes, sth even from you.
            Russian counterspies- PP's parents were traiters and they must remain as that.
                    is he conspiring against my parents- let me approach and clarify what he is talking about.
                    Insideous 6 attack space ship- put on surveillance video- it is breached- and lock pressure doors.
                    30 sec to copy where chameleon is hidden- Spiderman here- it's good to be recognized helps your PR.
                    Surprised to see me big boy- delighted- Perhaps he wants me hold you still to hit you.
                    Kingpin said about new life and we start by depriving you of yours. Colonel stops him and saves spiderman.
                    at last I have found 6 douches again. Cloaking device helped them escape from spidey.
            Aunt may reveals US best spies (i know cuz i was) finding out about dooms day weapon of german- 
                    never used till 70s so thought as hoax- parents stumbled across the scientist. And there plane crash.
                    working with USSR- once there revealed that they were USSR spies all along.
                    Conclusion was parents lied for being in USSR and german scientist not alive.
    Are you okay- no, angry- wanna find out truth in USSR.
            I don't resolve this- I will go crazy- but who pays me to russia.
            barely doing with freelance work for bugle.
    Spiderman said he is going to Russia- you said he is menace to world; maybe you are right- going global.
            think about this- their govt is in turmoil- maybe wants to be a leader- what if becomes so.
            fears are valid- I will go with him- Robby agrees! what is he up to- no story takes you to siberia.
            who you met at airport- excuse me for sleep- secretive is unlike him. I am ready to get on a story as soon as you are.
            get sleep- this gives time to spidey to look around. Sees robby sneaking this hour.

    Neither of us want to spend remaining time in russian jail cell.
    Liss is kidnapped- we are expensive but get job done.
    Robby I am going with you- we are for bugle- whether you like it or no.
    kisses to meet- PP pushes back- how do you know one another.
    No reminiss- tell about Gretsig German scientist. KGB get american jounalists out- dogs!
    KGB is chasing us- they have found out that we were portraying as traitors while being loyal to country.
            came here to warn you; we won't leave moscow alive.
            Dooms' day weapon is in NY- 20 yr back- KGB was behind their plane crash.
            Now they after lady's father to get doom's day weapon.
    why did chameleon not change to escape me- cuz he wants to lead me to a trap.
            all villains- did you come separate on flights or choose a supervillains package deal!
            After this I will be powerful than I ever imagined- you always have plans what makes you different this time.
            If not for you friend PP- I would killed you. World villain- you sound like saturday cartoon.
            great! I have handed most powerful device to kingppin- could there be worse.
            Now where I am hanging- One thing is sure I gotta start to hang around with better class of people.
            One of your men traited- who?- this is trade-secret. You go where money takes you- I prefer these gentlemen more- their dishonesty is honest.
            Saved after effort- now that's an eticket ride- and it's not over yet.
            I would fire you if you were not a freelance. Sorry JJ, there was sth more than your newspaper's worry.
    Chapter 3- secrets of the six
    Making super soldier experiment and made- captain america. formula lost along with scientist. assistants tried- new was unstable- no1 hurt but amazing result.
            1 could be lighter than air- 1 faster- 1 sonic shock waves- 1 duplicated captain america- not permanent so fear of siezed- ring devices to turn on/off.
            Miss America, Thunder and with these names they thought to be taken seriously.
            Captain america sacrificed so that dooms device would never be used- do I have that? pray that I never find out.
    Keys with 6 heros- once attack on wife- he played power couldn't- learnt lesson that with great power comes great responsibility.

            B4 company comes, if you give party, then it is sign of confidense.
                    when consequence precedes cause, it is sign of confidense.
                    how you know it is consequence- from general experience. OR agree to them too much- haan haan wahi OR bilkul sahi Mr X hamesha sahi bolta hai, timepass saala.

    GOT so nice that I see frequently- I know which scenes are worth watching again and again.
        there are other things in GOT also- exposed!

        no, they can't do it- what's the way out.
            there may be health reasons- talk to in charges, not others.
            or go thru food comm.
        Is that why you hit him? OR this is no reason to hit someone OR is that why his jaw was disoriented.
        Should have told him I want Jain meal doesn't meal I follow Jain principle of Ahimsa!!
    7 went about a slow but intelligent teacher- this guy must be your favorite- I said yes he is there- RC Sir is there.
        What's say on CN Sir? I like his hand.
    See this type of question everybody will do- how will they decide first ranker? why should others' solving be a problem for you?
        (you should rather wish that all would solve it)

    I saw on shaadi.com his father's profile- why, you wanna marry the girl or his father?

            Local hi mil gaya - I mean from same place - laughable cuz of different world views.
                    milta nahi hai - liya jaata hai attitude. Arrange marriage mood revealed - nth wrong with that but why impose that on others!
                    There is an assumption that other person is into arranged marriage - gotta challenge that! 
                    That way we will hardly speak anything - there are differences in world views - no, there is huge intersection for major parts.
            Wish a great life ahead - shadi when? Marriage package of information should float up.

            railways on console. Reliance on SAP logon - separate ABAP Servers for e1. doesn't come with all tcodes. mdrs is byd specifiec. abap logon is only client for abap server.
                    NW version which supports tenancy multiple. 000 and 001 admin client to read all db entries others not permitted by ngap layer. so it has to be inbuilt for support
                    but even in se38 i can't make call to another client so that means it is beyond ngap or ngap is inbuilt with abap.
                    ML in abap inbuilt so solid - but gotta do it - makes system heavy.
            ini file existed in corrupted state so web dispatcher couldn't write on it. HDB Daemon. gotta know the architecture completely to be able to appreicate.
            Monsoon IaaS. Umbrella on deployment!!
            sap good reputation. what an architecture. eth standardized and proper but price paid with performance.
            SAP dispatcher is the control agent which manages the resources for the R/3 applications. Functions of Dispatcher. Equal distribution of transaction load to the work processes Management of buffer areas in main memory Integration of the presentation levels Organization of communication activities
                    R/3 is all abap screen. ECC! they are habituated - end user like html but fast workers don't want time to be wasted. Eg railways.
                    GLO for SCM, FIN; 4 teams for byd around 30 people - 3 in India and 1 in germany
            in abap we use old version managements of locks and all - but ui uses git.
                    people learn abap - buy server license, etc.
            console fast - press one vs scroll - voice interaction until you hear the option - slower than ui where you have to wait till your option comes unlike see mesh of options.
            let them have break after hard work - but still talk cuz we like speaking about our field.

    YT Comments to Ep4 reactions
	Jon to Tormund: You can have Ghost. I have a dragon now.
		Rhaegal: Dies
		Jon: Can I have Ghost back?﻿
	"We are losing so much money on the dragons and Ghost for the final episodes"
		Writers: " I have a plan"﻿
	To be fair, if my enemy had dragons, I would build as many scorpions as I could, and put them everywhere!
	don't understand how you don't see a fleet of pirates behind a tiny island while RIDING A DRAGON﻿
	I come here, I watch those reactions . 
		I become happy the rest of the day.﻿
	I'm hoping in the next episode Gendry has made Drogon some kick ass armor
	Euron hits Rhaegal three times in a row but can't hit Drogon when he's coming directly at him. Seems legit
	If only they had someone in a wheelchair who could see everything in his mind and could easily tell you if there was an ambush waiting for you. If only.﻿
	That one woman's screams are legit more painful than the dragon dying to me﻿
	Character sits down
		Burlington Bar: "AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"﻿
	They honestly should've just led the Night King and his entire army of the dead to King's Landing last episode
	Imagine what was going through Euron’s mind when Tyrion started talking about the baby
	interesting how Cersi loved her children more than anything .. and lost them thus resulting in her dark side emerging ..
		The exact same thing is happening to Dany. She is losing her children and is about to lose the plot. They are more alike than they realise﻿
	Jon: You both swear you'll never tell anyone.
		Arya: I swear.
		Sansa: I swear.
		Also Sansa: Listen up, everybody Jon is the true Targaryen.
		Exactly my humor﻿
	I regret watching this. I had to relive losing a dragon twice in one day, too much for my heart﻿
	Everybody's like "NO! NO" and I'm like "YES! YES!" 
		I would be so lynched if I were on this bar, LOL﻿
	haven't shed a tear since Hodor died
	love how so many people complain about the show now but still continue to watch it
	Daenerys really needs to burn them all﻿
	What do we say to the Lord of Storm's End?

	My reaction at this moment was like reaction of thor when he sees hulk in Ragnarok﻿

	The Baratheon Bois can't never get the Stark girls..
		No doubt his Robert's son﻿
	John: "Vomiting isn't celebrating."

	Jon giving up Ghost is symbolically him giving up his Stark-dom
	never really found Sansa that hot but this season....My God..
	Jon:"this is the Great War..the only war that matters"
		Cersei:"pfff! hold my beer!"﻿
	Gendry's first act as Baratheon is getting rejected by a Stark... he really is his father's son
	What if dannys child was ACTUALLY a dragon. That would be fun...﻿
	Why attack King's Landing? better to wait for Arya to kill Cercei﻿
	On a scale of Sansa to Ned Stark how good are you at keeping secret﻿
	The last Stark is about Sansa; Jon is a Targ, Bran is the 3 eyed raven, and Arya is no one
	Thanks for making these videos. You're helping me survive between episodes.﻿

		Next Sunday, these same people are still glued to their television sets
	I'm gonna be pissed if Drogon doesn't get to burn Kings Landing!﻿
	Watching Endgame and this episode in the same day was not good for my depression
	I need to know what Varis heard in the flames before he dies!!!!!!! Wont hold my breath.﻿
	Jon: "Ghost should go north, I have a dragon now!" Writers : "Hold my beer"﻿
	I can't be the only dumbass who thought Missandei was going to get pushed and Tyrion was going to cushion her fall or something...right?
	"BURN THEM ALL!!"﻿
	everyone: greyworm will die
		actual show: let greyworm lose everything he cares for lmao
	1. Tyrion would say "the baby you have with Jaime" instead of just "the baby" and effectively end her relationship with Euron. Euron would get mad quickly.
	2. Missandei would grab Cersei the moment she said "if you have any last words" and throw herself over the wall effectively killing her executioner and winning the war for Dany.
		But writers we're left with are not very good at writing fan fiction.﻿
	I just cant wait for this whole shit show to end so everyone can get on with their lives.

		After seeing how Jon did Ghost I’m perfectly fine if the writers kill Jon and never bring him back﻿
	Dany, she's worked so hard, come so far and lost so much in her race for the Iron Throne. Now she's absolutely terrified of losing everything and everyone for nothing﻿
	No one:

	When she says "Drakarys", everyone yells in the bar, but for me, it was the last sign that Daenerys goes full Aerys 2.0 ...
	Thats not Cersei.
		The real Cersei would had killed all of them right there at her gates﻿
	yeah but cersei is not really one for diplomacy. everyone knows in the old GOT she would have killed everyone there﻿
	Lol, Varys immediately slapping down the anti-cock cheers from the crowd﻿

	Man, props to you guys for trying to make sense of the writing this season
	Melissandra kept throwing things against the wall until something stuck.  Even broken clocks are right twice a day...﻿
	"Brown eyes, green eyes, and blue eyes" basically covers everyone. It was an unlosable prediction. 
    YT Comments GOT ep8.5
	Shoutout Bran for sending a Horse Uber for Arya﻿

	People: "Cercei is probably going to be killed by one of her brothers, as prophesied"
		Rubble: "Hold my cement"﻿ or concrete.
	hinted at from s1 but escalation of her madness was poorly written and rushed.﻿
	I guess we'll never know what the voice from the flames told Varys.﻿
	Thank you for telling me that I’m watching the entire show incorrectly.  I must remember that the show has to follow my personal “fan fiction.”﻿
	"I've never known bells to mean surrender." - Davos Seaworth, Battle of Blackwater, S2E9
	Agree with most of it. 

	But arya around the city was to show the consequences of the Danys actions. Showing what the common folk go through. Raped. Slaughtered. Screaming and running in random directions. Jon wouldnt have had fit that as he was fighting.

	Cersei death wasnt empathy. She was lost for the first time in her life. She thought it would be a glorious victory but she is buried by the rubble with her lover. The same way tywin killed his enemies

	People complaining about cleganebowl but they were the ones bitching for it from the beginning 
	Every single season dany  was killing people horribly after being "wronged" it was there but could have been dine better

	It was a parallel to viserys when she was loved by the dothraki. He felt threatened and got even more mad because he felt she was overtaking him. So be launched an attack on her and it got him killed byji her
	 
	Jon is loved by everyone. She has grown jealous and feels threatened because he is better than her. She wont attack him but has killed who ever chooses him and wont let his secret out. And then as she had a dragon lost it on an innocent city because of her jealousy and will be killed for it

	It's always been the parallels. Every season she did something daft and tried to justify it. They could have done it better but last year there was a lot of misguidance. Tbf they tricked everyone because everyone thought Jon and Dany would have a kid. And then she grew jealous and mad because she felt was she being betrayed and had lost a lot like viserys
	u know none of that would have happen if john didnt have erectile dysfunction﻿
	gray worm is an analogy for daenerys. once you lose someone you love, its over. its personal. its emotional. its not about principal. its about revenge. you killed her dragons. You challenged her. This is the meaning of the game of thrones.﻿
	At least George RR Martin knows how NOT to end the books. Lol﻿

	The Producers have Gone Mad Kings on us all!﻿
	Me: they butchered the night king arc, but at least the Cersei arc can still be good. 
		Me: surprised Pikachu﻿
	Btw Aerys didn't become this mad king overnight. It was a slow process accompanied by a 6 months long hostage situation﻿
	This is game of thrones there are no main characters didn't you learn that when ned's head hit the floor?﻿
	Defending the show
		Dany always showed signs of this rage and impulsive actions, and is way more interesting as a morally grey character
			(that game of thrones is so famous for) then just a complete hero, which she never was.
		Dany is not going to be the same person at the beginning and end, that is just ridiculous. The loss she suffered moulded her into this
		Her character is symbolic of the extent people will go for power - although she had good intentions, these cannot always be realised
		In the game of thrones, no one is completely evil or completely perfect, and this showed that
		Although her actions have been evil, many decisions have come in the protection of her kids - 
		feeling sorry for her in her last moments shows that everything is complicated and nothing is black and white.﻿
	Tbh when cersei was looking out the window in the red keep I was waiting for ayra to pop outta no where n stab her. ( From the outside )﻿
	Danny turned into a mad queen because of power lust.﻿
	I really applaud the actors for their 11/10 effort on the script
	Jesus why keep watching if you dislike it??﻿
	stop whinging,  just because it didn't go the way you wanted... it's all pretend, and you're in shock
	Cersei  clearly  planted wildlife  over the city in a type of counter attack. I loved it!﻿
	The way Qyburn died in a single frame should be a meme on its own
	Rip Varys. The only man that cared about the realm no matter who sat on the throne.  He was right and was murdered anyways
	Robert Baretheon, the only one who warned everyone about Daenerys Targaryen since the start. BOW TO HIM
	Cersei: I’ll burn this city to the ground with wildfire before I let her take it from me!
		Dany: hold my Starbucks
	Season 8 is like when you really want to finish your homework and go out and play with ya mates
	What do we say to a good ending? 
		D&D - Not today.﻿
	The real villains of the show are Dan and Dave﻿
	At least not 1 Elephant was killed in the making of this episode﻿
	Episode 4: Scorpions are 100% accurate and Drogon is vulnerable
		Episode 5: Scorpions became stormtroopers and Drogon's fire can take down every building﻿
	Is it just me or did unmasked Mountain look like a huge zombie Varys?﻿
	RIP Jaime's redemption and arc. Saddest death in the entire show. He died for nothing but shock value.﻿
	Funny how Jamie killed the mad king to save all the people in Kings land  yet doesn’t care about them in the end
	their hair colors have changed over seasons.
	Arya is definitely gonna kill Cercie
		Dany is definitely gonna kill Cercie
		Jaime is definitely gonna kill Cercie
		Bricks : Hold my cement﻿
	advisors died off this season => slight change in her each time. now, council that she doesn't trust.
		combination of revenge and rage
		She stuck to 2 things in that moment: 1- Her desire to win and 2- Her true self: A Dragon Dragons aren't merciful, logical, or nice. 
		They eat innocent farmers in the fields like we saw a couple seasons ago
		When she said "Let it be fear, then", it was almost like she was giving herself permission to be her true self. I thought that was pretty epic.
		Dany has always been the Mad Queen. But she wasn't able to access it fully until the people around her that were holding her back were dead and gone
		It's bittersweet because we wanted her to be good, but that's not who she is.
	But the most important question is.. Does Bronn get Highgarden?﻿
	I will pretend this episode doesn't exist.﻿
	This is what happens when GRRM doesnt finnish the books...﻿
	PLEASE tell me why they create Bran character for??? sit on the wheel chair till the end of GOT!!﻿
	Jaime: I want to fight for the living...
		Jaime: I never cared much for people anyway...
	We've reached the last episode of Game of Thrones. Many kings died, queens died, innocent people died, even the dead died again and Jon Snow still knows nothing
	So, how is the dragon literally able to produce that much gas?﻿
	Seasons 1-7: Game of Thrones
		Season 8: Grey's Anatomy with Dragons﻿
	What about all the people that named their daughter Daenerys
	This show is ending too fast...feeling like eating instant noodles dry...﻿
	Instagram comments' section is Mad Queen 2.0﻿
	Season 8 feels like more flash over substance
	To hell with the valanqor prophecy about Cersei
	Essentially, Kings landing got nuked...Targaryen style. Dany completes the order her father gives before he is murdered
	Bran warged into the white horse and uber rescued Arya
	I told my brother clegane bowl was gonna be my favorite scene from this season and it really was
	Madking:-"burn them all."
		Dany:-task completed pops."﻿
	Targaryan meant to have purple eyes , Arya dosnt close purple eyes 
	What the hell was Bran doing the whole episode?﻿
	Do dragons have like an unlimited supply of fuel?﻿
	This Episode was great! The Dragon became a Dragon, and "Burnt them all"!﻿
	Dany was smart by guiding Drogon to take out all the Scorpions, and the Iron Fleet first, 
		after that, it was all just shake-n-bake
	Well, looks like Winterfell's the new capital of Westeros lads, GG﻿
	This was the best episode of this season visually
	I hoped that Bran would varg in one of the dragons.Remember whole *you may not walk but you will fly"
	Charlie baby what you doing with that sword
	Mad King: no one is crazier than me! 
		Dany: Hold my Dragon Egg. 
		Rhaegar:.....
		Ned: looks to Lyanna and Rhaegar this is what happens when you ELOPE.﻿
	Most of the other YouTube breakdowns have annoyed me. They just complained. I really enjoyed your video. 
	Her story is fitting. I am ok with it
	Drogon is stronger and faster then Rhegal
	Cersei truly died “at the hands” of the Valonqar!﻿
	shocked that's how they decided to kill Cersei/Jamie﻿
	GOT Logic: The number of unsullied and dothrakis multiply in each battle. They are basically combat amoebas
	Team doctor doing the concussion test: what's your name
		Arya: a girl has no name
		Doctor: what day is it?
		Arya: not today﻿
	Hey Danny, how do you like episode 5 of season 8? - Dracarys!﻿		
    YT Comments
	Ending seems to be directed by catelyn stark
		-Bran is the King of Six kingdoms
		-Sansa is the Queen in the north
		-Arya is doing whatever she wants
		-Jon is exiled
	By stabbing Danny, Jon created many flaming swords, the melting of the Iron Throne.
	Anybody else notice the raven on Brienne's breastplate after Bran became king? I thought that was a cool touch
	They crammed 3 seasons into 3 episodes
	Bran: I can't be lord of winterfell. I'm the three eyed raven.
		Also bran: BOW DOWN TO YOUR NEW KING BITCHES
	The script was missing for the episode..
	Number one thing we all missed was a proper ending to the show. 
		End of story... see how I did that
	It's sad that the relative Jon knew for the shortest time was the one who liked him the most
	3 things I missed?
		1. Competent writing.
		2. A refund for my HBO subscription.
		3. The bottle of water everyone’s talking about.
	We missed none of these things. We fans are much smarter
	didn't like that they made Daenerys a villian real quick
	Sooooo Jon Snow is the Queenslayer right!!
		No??
		Ok
	Winter is coming..
		It's bloody cold and snowing..
		Why doesn't anyone wear a nice furry hat.???
	And I thought the sopranos ending was bad
	Dany: "I'm not going to destroy the wheel, I'm going to break the wheel!"
		Bran: "Too bad, you forgot to break my wheelchair."
    YT Comments
	Euron: I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister
		Redkeep: Brickarys﻿
	liked arya running through the chaos but i hated the 374th fakeout death scene﻿
	Grandmaester Pycelle: “I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?”﻿
	They should have ended the NK arc in season 7 and focused on dany becoming the mad queen this season﻿
	people who laid a bet down in the offseason that Greyworm of all people would still be alive for the series finale are pretty much financially set for life now.﻿
	it should have been best but so rushed - should have been more heart breaking.
		0/10 although technically brilliant but how you get there.
		character arc change in dany is too sudden.
	I'm honestly still upset that Jaime said that he never cared for innocent lives when he literally became the Kingslayer to save innocent lives.﻿
	Cersei should get her money back with the Golden Company
	why euron, jamie fight.
	Jon would have slept with her if he knew she would burn the city if he didn’t﻿
	The moment Cersei realizes she's an amateur﻿
	honor vs love by jamie. rule vs love by dany - the show is about heart in conflict with itself.
	Just thought I'd remind people that Edmure Tully is still alive. And has yet to be released from prison
	only just realised that Varys was trying to poison Danerys with the food﻿
	Qyburns death made me laugh out loud﻿
	Cersei walking past Clegane brothers like"excuse me... Don't mind me" Had me laughing out loud lmao﻿
    YT GOT Notes
	There are no heroes in Game of Thrones or in life. Only humans. (...and dragons)﻿
	Yeah I think we'll name our twins Ramsay and Roose? Why not?﻿
	Every idea Tyrion told her went to shlt and screwed her over. Tyrion told her about the bell so she decided to not trust him about it to not get screwed over again.
	It`s because Jon didn`t put out her fire
		Because script wanted her to kill every one﻿
	When you put more thought into GoT than the writers...
	Foreshadowing is not the same thing as character development﻿
	When Tywin Lannister lasted longer on the toilet than the Golden Army did on the battlefield﻿
	Producers: the fans will totally love this episode
		Writers: hold my papers﻿
	Daenerys & Night King: I'm immune to dragonfire!
		Strickland's white horse: Hold my beer﻿
	Wow say what you want about season 8, but these motherfuckers actually built Kings Landing basically in their back yard lmao.
		That is one of the most amazing sets/feats I've ever seen...﻿
	Production Team : Excellent 
		Actors : Salute
		Music (Ramin Djawadi) : This man deserve Iron Throne.
		Writers : Dracarys﻿
	I know its not their fault, but we didn't want a battle... we wanted a story lol﻿
	May the Lord of Light protect us all, for the screen is dark and the script is full of errors
	Guys thats the wrong video to hate on! This here is the story of the people who make the episodes look good, they have done nothing wrong!﻿
	Jon's full script for this season :"She's my queen !"﻿
	Ed Sheeran had more lines than the Captain of the Golden Company﻿
	Benioff: "She has said repeatedly 'I will take what is mine with fire and blood.'" 
		S7 Dany: "I am not here to be queen of the ashes."
		hmmmmm....﻿
	imagine how much money they would have saved if Daenerys went straight to the tower with Cersei﻿
	Danerys had everything but the Iron throne.
		Cersei had nothing but the Iron throne.﻿
	If Night King had " Unagi" he would have been survived
	Meanwhile, Sansa and Bran are in Winterfell drinking tea
	I didn't pay attention to the cup because when Tormund is on, I watch Tormund.﻿
	It's from the new Winterfell coffee shop, Starksbucks.﻿
	Well, it is a fictional world and Starbucks is everywhere.﻿
	Bran is a time traveler and just bought a coffee... Whats the deal? 
	The Night King just wanted to introduce coffee to the world﻿
	jon snow invented since medieval age stark-bucks. 
		because its so cold in winter fell he need coffee﻿
	You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
	Ok so basically the Night King came to Westeros to save it from Daenerys?﻿
	vedic.
	A moment of silence for people who named their children after Daenerys
	Golden company is coming
		Golden Company is here
		Golden company is dead﻿
	guess the coin landed mad side up﻿
	The Mad King: BURN THEM ALL
		Daenerys: Hold my ale﻿
	God damn Tywin was the best character. So deep, so skilled, so flawed

	geez... Her Dracarys sounds so powerful, much more powerful than Dany's﻿

	So why did Melissandra brought him back to life?﻿
	Song of ice and fire is the story of Jon/ice and Dany/fire. You guys just dont see the genius.﻿
	Bran became the king was definitely surprising
	Jon did get his perfect ending.  He didnt want to be king. He belongs in the north, free, with ghost .﻿
	Waiting for season 9 - The ending should be Jon comes back with the wildings and claim his throne!﻿
	A bad song of ice and fire......Oh! "A Rap of Ice and Fire."﻿
    YT Comments
	The first men multiplied like rats
	Everyone: episode is too dark
		Director: get an HDR TV you peasant
	Nobody: 
		Watchmojo: is that sexism? I think so!
	Bran the broken .. 
		Also, broke all others' story arcs
	Once Bran (the builder or whatever) said, "Why do you think I came all this way?" I would have said, "Okay, that disqualifies you from being king...next
	One major flaw was after The Long Night when discussing battle plans they stated how they lost what 80% of the army but in one of Dany's last scenes there was the full army again?
	In the crypt scene, when the dead come to life, how do they break out of concrete coffins? When the one they captured couldn't get out of a wooden box
	Lesson learned. Don't rush anything. We can wait
	Probs
		1. Bad inconsistent writing
		2. Heaps of plot Armour
		3. Unsatisfying end to the walkers after all 7 season long build up ( walkers were literally the very first scene in the show!) 
		4. Dany mad queen needed more build up
		5. Finale was Alright
		Summary - plot holes (unconvincingly sth happened), plot drops (extrapolation gone terribly wrong) - discontinuity, character arc (plot hole on personal level) - discontinuity or differentiability; Inconsistencies - contradictions. Foreshadowing ignored - all for nothing - plots traces of past leading to nowhere - hanging midair.
			mood shifts - once you see him heroic and another they are suffering.
			your ideologies are not respected. She was gentle she could not do this.
			Eg - varys won't play cards on face.
	Sexist writing....okay, it was a bad season but shut up with that lol
	Dany meets Night King
		Dany: Night King?

	misconception - introverts who have very little self-confidence
		more to do with energy and how they recharge
		derive their energy from being around similar people, whereas introverts derive energy away from people, usually in private
	tried "escalating" touch......... Sexual harassment suit....... Lost job, now homeless...... Thanks robot lady.
	Introverts come with a few issues. Listed below:-
		1. Highly skeptical
		2. Very observant hence less forgiving of her flaws.
		3. Aware of human negatives hence vigilant. Leading to trust issues.
		4. Reading deep into her personality, gestures and actions, leading to a barrage of data input (that needs to be processed instantaneously) . This deters any chances of quick advanves from an introvert, and comes across as lack of decisiveness (or interest).
		5. Leading a highly aware life leaves them unable to form companionship.
	the fact that this was in my recommended i can asume one of two things 
		A : youtube thinks i am intelligent 
		B : youtube/FBI man just want me to feel better about being single
	Smart people have a hard time doing dumb things, that's why.
	Over-analyzation and weak social skills are the most likely culprit
	Freud said: “to be happy you have to be dumb or act like you are dumb”.
	The only main problem is we don’t fall for lies, we notice everything
	see all the cracks in a fake argument, we see all he hidden intentions of the people around us, being smart is a bless and a curse

        Elicit Behavior
                Reinforcement - We want a behavior to increase (purpose - strengthen ; means - reward)
                        Positive - Add the sth desirable
                        Negative - Remove the sth undesirable
                Discouragement - a behavior is to be decreased (purpose - diminish ; means - punish)
                        Positive - Add the sth undesirable.
                        Negative - Remove the sth desirable.
                                taking away a certain reinforcing
                Positive consequences are more powerful than negative consequences for improving behavior
                        Reinforcement > Punishment.
        abstraction
				I am walking; stepping on smooth ground.
				I am progressing towards bus post.
				I am on my way to temple. (previous one is assumed for the next one)
		Observations
			less than comparative money- ppl take you for cheat or embarrassment for unrevealed reason.
			Google map from satellite view to map is an abstraction.
			Anything that pricks has a potential to lead exponential growth in you/society.
				Standardize solution as per experience gained and discussions had. Upload in quora for public interest.
		Life Decision making criteria
			Trans- All an offering or needful
			Spiritual- Social ideology
				Exemplify PIES- concerned and talk their PIES.
				B-(helps needy, forums to expose needs)
				Accessible J- forums to talk thru all social issues of concern. Political punch- why wait for punch, when you can do without it as duty. Be a man!
				All discussions being D- talk concerns, decide protocols, standardize on quora, etc
				Measure achievements and deeds in a resume
			False Ego- Personal Ideology
				PIES SV, BV
				E- Group dynamics, powerful arguments, hilarious ones. Standardize std stuff.
				Feel awesome in all fields
			Intellect- discern and determine for evolutions/growth in personal PIES
			Mental- experience and enjoy amusements, emotions.
			Sense- 
		browser control shift delete- for history deletion
		PIES- Gym, Yoga; Morning Streak; Weekend outing, movies, songs, fanta, motivation, affirmations; CNT, 
		PG is always there in back up. So no fears. You will always have a ceiling in a house, better it has a paint of your choice.
		trybe.in for resume making
		When mistake proned, tolerate the insults even corrections or political manipulations.
			if you complain, they can expose weakness.
			they also make mistakes but won't take responsibility- that's also ok.
			You gotta become a good player.
		Besides being good, we must ensure we are also perceived to be so.
			politics out of fear, politics out of desire.
			reinforce your perceptions in every opportunity and corroborate speech (words) with thoughts and action for integrity.
			This combination works awesome.
			Eg- Priyansh- ise 4 hours mein finish kar denge. Meeting on tuesday, he would repeat this for them to be there on time (as if he is in control)
			Eg- Vikram- joined company and participating in I/V taking; reinforces his knacks in his field; admits his improvement areas; proves knack with every opportunity
				started giving presentations in his area of expertize- can be contacted for the area. Asks questions and reinforces perceptions- I can do in 1 hr.

        <Wisdom>
        	<Truth>
			Truth benefits (integrity- act as per knowledge; honesty- speak as per knowledge)
				Light head- don't have to remember (Mark Twain) (what you said to whom- fear of accidentally contradict) => Light head and no stress => good sleep, eat, looks.
					Buddha- 3 things can't remain hidden for long- sun, moon and truth.
				Trustworthy => Reputation as truthful=> new and better friends; (more believable => ppl like to work with you, persuasive); respond likewise and follow ur eg 
					Subordinates happy that they are evaluated on merit and not sycophancy/flattery	
					Einstein- Truth not taken seriously in small matters, won't be taken in large ones.
				self worth- self-confidense and pride (looks self in mirror) vs self-criticism and depression.
				Living the truth
					Out of alignment, your loss.
					difficult matter that requires openness, vigilance, and humility.
				Understand world and ourselves better- the way things/ we really are.
					humility of not knowing- opens gateways to more profound mysteries.
					curious and fill gaps in understanding (see things as they are)
					deep understanding of things (from diff angles we have analysed)
			How to get to truth
				Question ourselves- my brought up, etc.
					my motivational bias and cognitive bias.
					other relevant points of views study
				change ur mind often- other perspectives
				look for evidence against our views (counter eg)
				not to overstate confidense.
		</Truth>
		<ahimsa>
			Non-violence
				peaceful coexistence- good relationships.
				unhealthy destructions saved- don't harness the best of that.
				harmony and understanding
				ppl flee away from countries where violence exists- HR lost.
				your own resources wasted- country resources on maintaining peace. HR for peace b4 devp starts.
				Acceptance of all ppl (& decide accordingly)- cherish and celebrate community- utilize.
				Respect for life and envt
				it is patience to win.
				cool head for innovation, knowledge, sacrifice, service.
        	</ahimsa>

			saathi - saath. Jeevan saathi. ham safar
			apne svarup- mein rahiye. ham bhramane ke liye nahi aaye.
				aapka svarupa wo, jisme aap 24 hr rah saken.\
			ek bar decide karlo, samajh li- ullanghan nahi karna.
			dhan laxmi/maya ho jaata hai- depending on the purpose it is used for.
		
		Maryada no inapt input (aahar) into body- 
			aahar becomes a part of our body, mind.
				causes vidhvans, 
				maryada purushottam bhagavaan ki jay.

				alcohol- maut ke saudagar. baba maryada mein rahen.
			satya itna that ppl can digest else awkward.
			business- saatvik, raajasik, tamasic (alcohol, cigrette)
				what's the end result of it.
				hamari kya galti hai? meri bhi maryada hai.
			Ishwar ki karma fal vyavastha akatya hai.
				You are darshak (maun), support thru hotel management (are paap)
				do paise aa rahe hain but parinaam to dekh.
				svaavalambit village vs global.
				Pratipaksha bhaavana- motivation speech is big business.
					karne waala, karvane wala (hatya karvana), mauna darshak/ support.
						papa ne bola ghar par nahi hai.
						baba is in samadhi- why lie? tell sleeping.
						Lie or support lie. Bhagavan wo jo GOD. without starting, ever existing.
				sveekar karna- principles.  sva + kar. 
				kaise khusi se jee len- you crush your khushi- choose happiness.
				Life is never full of paap, punya- take first step one by one you reach 50% like me.

		It's gaming everywhere- in discussions (who cracks better joke, talks most utilitarian, gratification, cool, emotion engaging)
			People want engagement of different emotions (why movies)- experience.
			Make gaming a fun like in a game. Getting serious over game (like verge of crying) vs jokes, fun, frolic, challenge, kidding (I allowed u)	
			Don't try to joke- live the jovial life (jokes be a part of your vision- you see jokes around)
				Take inspiration from those who are dedicated to comedy.
		
		
		Problem instances are meant to be solved
			books, ppl
			gacch, we are 1.
		Pyaar mein karma bandhan nahi hai. bandhan hai- independent "I" mein.

			gives u sync with the purpose (forced to align and believe)
			allows u relive as different person but this time with wisdom.

			log bache paida nahi karte, ho jaate hain.
				go thru life vs grow thru life. drugs to escape life lessons.
			love bcuz it assists prayojan, how?		
			Big ppl are not chastised- people just take their stands/actions about it.
				young ppl are chastised for them to improve. disapprove their stand (for them to change)

        Quora and Vedanta sth
		B4 speaking, think
			True, Helpful, Inspiring, necessary, kind.
		Spirituality does not demand to delve into law of karma
		    but abstract it out- cause-effect relationships of material existence
		    now what? spiritual puruit
	Swami Ramdev and others
		anartha nivritti- (satisfaction by sincere DS)
			Accepting the kernel of DS (actions not based on MMN, but SM's vision/ principles)
			PIES is apara dharma but undercurrent of curbing BV and enhancing SV is still there (with returns)
				why grihasthashram- tuscle with MMN exists with e1.
				protection from adharma (celibate's wandering eyes, need for personal attention)
					he should accept an external situation which matches with his conditional being- so as to practice DS in a stable way.
					he has not accepted a situation to flow with MMN but to accept a situation best suited to practice the principles that give advancement.

		When I am doing eth to my capacity- whatever comes is accepted as lord's prasad
			aptakam
			jo bhagavan mujhse karva rahen hain- karta jaa rahaa hoon.
			exercise, music, yoga all in MMN.
			janma kundali nahi karma kundali theek karo
			body by mind, mind by satya, vidya and tapa for intel.

		ruchi- consistent (stable state)
		Sambandha jnana- is power
			Eg- Syami explores the home state- items present. Knowledge of their abhideya is also important.
			Given a prayojan- you can immediately address it. Knowledge of new prayojan instances satisfying your vision or updating/ upgrading your vision (making it more satisfying)
			recorders, etc are great help- but nevertheless are unnatural.
				I won't attend abhishek cuz I have seen video n times. what non-sense- live in now.
		How much do you value your KC (assets in KC)
			are you fearful of maya? cultivate it.

        Brahma Kumaris
	Who will protect in old age?
		Sanyas- van prastha- no1.
		Himalaya gaman is not to come back.
			God is basis.
		Some say they are happy in old age homes.
			upekshit vs sth to share heart with.
	vivah- together towards sadgati- but other doesn't support.

		Should he wait? Your way is your own. If no sahamati then go alone but positive thinking.
			sneha zaroor rakho.
			no impelsion- any desire then fulfill.
		give positive vibes.
	KY- Yoga mein rehte hue kiya hua karma (1min/hr)
		early morning and b4 sleeping- are best hours (pack up eth)
		less tired mind will do with 6 hrs.
		diffl- try it out! you can see what you can do.
			wake up in time and rest in day if necessary.
		morning vibes to soul- then see how your day changes (ego comes in betw)
		kali yuga- polluted city and even washed clothes- affects and sat yuga
	vishvas breaks cuz not paramatma eth
		goods I did and bad god!
		prob comes cuz of karma
		exam is mine- God should sit in my exam? I want degree- gotta go thru it.
			dearest friend- you get operation for me!
			Gita gave knowledge but fight still Arjuna.
			sadbuddhi, shakti- solving a prob is not god's role.
		Doctor can give medicine but it is us that gotta take it.

	Conscious mind and subconscious- money in pocket vs Bank.
		eth we do , sh it comes to indelible impression.

	I sit with Lord and get guidance and get back.
		info that sth bad will happen- law of attraction. Determine that good will happen and acceptance.
			I am powerful and power sheath of God is on me- I am in ring of positive energy
			ghar is not time- comfort, security, protection.
	To child
		talk to 7 in eyes, skilled, talk freely.
			grades going down and not exploring world. not playing.
			goal driven- dropped out of college, no drive to improve (low job profile),
			no drive to be a better man- then got zest back to life.

		 Attitude- jo bhi hoga dekha jaayega (what i do about it is what matters), eth happens for good.
		 Every situ trains us that this also happens in life and train us for future- never dishearten.
		 These add to experience- life teaches- do you learn? don't escape.
		 PhD try best for 3 months and no result- am I mad? Pessimism comes. 1 day off- but gotta do nth but this (no escape)
		 ends up giving practical lesson. Modify approach for future in light of this and in general- where sth went wrong.

                Ultimately you want to do what you like- then why don't you do what you like (from now)
                Have a world model, this is what your ideal world looks like and what role you are going to play in that. Act accordingly
                        top down approach vs people use bottom up- where is crowd- where is highest paying job.
                Don't have to deny yourself of your interests.
                        Variegatedness of interest is ok- I like music, I like games, I like coding, etc.
                things get narrowed down eventually.
        Try all perms and combs- do things fast
        Confidence of little steps for larger plan- yarc works- so would REST API thru code.
        Any effort I do now, becomes a part of every day me.

        Daily Revision, weekly revision,...- no dependence on text but it's in my workspace/ rather a habit.
                dependable- people can depend on me- behavior.
        Understand properties/behavior of everything around you- topic of discussion and harness.

        Tell it in morning why it is important to you- extrinsic and intrinsic (bkT)- make it a must- use FDDL at mat/spi.
        How to be excellent at Jnana- excellent at dhyan (no dependence on cards), office time be like full of passion for the purpose/ emotional state/ taking full stand of knowledge
        Plan streaks of effort for the goal/ measure the goals.

        Relationship is important cuz it takes you to what you like in your own mind.
                Ppl make plans like roaming, trips, movies- serves 2 purposes- their own enjoyment and a friend.
                How to be midst ppl having rapport? 
                        Eg- Indore Samosa- wow- stay cool (let them experience)/ take a keyword which can become COA; 
                        IITMa folks- take initiative at raising topics or participate.
        look out for a working transaction then error codes for scope
                or a set of transactions which satisfy all edge traversal of FSM of transactions.
                DFS is not a good strategy for traversal.
                world needs easier access to information.
        Use good modularity- scale things gradually- if small steps work well- there combinations also will.
        Production code is no place for testing out sth new.

        7 goes nanana- challenge that move; express objection against that behavior- I am trying to understand so will you? OR I am asking him- it's diffl to focus otherwise OR implicitly no attention.
        By this time, you should have been champ of field, ain't it.
        Asked for help from mentor, then got the problem solved by version change
                she later approached with answer- realized I should have informed as soon as it was solved
                MNSingh Sir for S.St in school- should have informed him after the test- how it was.

        Your growth, speed of it, degree of it- in any realm depends on how much you can take it? Batman- we will hunt him cuz he can take it.
        Become a merchant of wow
                The service caters to interest- "BANG ON" they would say- this is exactly what we wanted- or more than what we wanted!
                Decoration- like amazing UI- didn't ask for it but makes it much better- asked for implementation but your UML diagrams make anyone understand in and out- along with tailor made implementation steps for next guy.

        Others
                OpenSSH in windows
                Interesting ToDo- login and explore rest api of fb, google, etc
        Learning Plans- bash, hadoop, R, DA udacity

        The idea is to understand the behavior of every entity and seamlessly connecting them- make all tools as your friends
                Make project grow incrementally.
        Know the breaking points of all external systems!!
                or if breaking system- below which it works fine.
        Idea- rest for windows api. use lscpu and parse.
                statement execution not asynchronous- read it.
                api for syscalls and corresponding linux commands
                RPC and RMI in java

        Architecture is generic solution of design- what principle (backdrop) is design going to follow- specifics can be worked out.
                Protocol for HLD- how the system works- communication, exchanges to make the system as a whole work.
                Requirement is preceded by proposed solution- and necessitates good understanding of what follow. All stages must account for what follows.
        helping them in purposes (as simple as run else you will miss the bus)- empathy (I am alone at home! - Oh! Look for justification), and then joke (Bus waits for you?)

        Precise- I am being granted administrative priviliges but can't exercise them.
                Preserve results/findings for discussion
        Trust your intuitions on things- when exposed to a tool- try out all possibilities and hypothesize what they are- standardize your capabilities- to be used when reqd.
        1 thing of yoga is high breaking point- high resilience.
        Thorough benchmarking (come up with showable outputs)

        You get a piece of code
                what is it for- use case
                view a demonstration of how the code looks at work
                draw a sequence diagram for the same- use abstraction concept- can be a criteria for how fast you learnt a code's HLD. Algo for LLD.
                        as you do it- mark- what responsibility each method is taking and where it matters in broad picture
                class diagram with package diagram- conglomerate all class method's behavior and demonstrate how great team it is
        Comments are for you- don't be like compiler overreading them. If not good, give better comment. If code, then glimpse.
        what we need is initiative- identify with the project- problem at hand- and don't wait for next steps from 7- start doing yourself- pick newer tools, make sheets and showcase them- it's your love with cslife, man!!

        If you can help even while not involved- must help
                like 7 going in direction of dead end.
                like 7 is confused with something. They didn't ask you but should take interest in helping them out to the extent you know- maybe they already know- but your service attitude is glorious.
                And when it comes to asking for help, feel free to ask, it may not get extended- but w/o knocking the door, the response is obvious.

        ppl pay us not for coding but business value it generates when it runs not when we write
                good refactor pays fast coding- paycheck on running code!
                that author has spoken lotta crazy shit but this thing he said write- map != territory. but improve map for better.
                gap betw know and is- SE gotta do it- we have mental model of code- often wrong
                can't know until we measure it- affects our decisions.
                find the bottleneck in code cuz more time- add an extra layer of data on top and confusion is gone- easy to find.
                measuring makes decisions better. but must know what to measure.

        Don't just watch things but appreciate them heartily.
        forgotten the feeling of hungry- cuz always eating on time.
        namkeen ki bhookh lag gayee to.
        What was I talking about? I was fully listening- just gimme a hint.
        you were not talking so i used time by singing on phone.
        khana koi achievement nahi hai- hota hai agar accha na banaa ho.
        soul talks- aap bas ho, aap sharir nahi ho- to kya hoon, mind bhi nahi ho.

                phod diya. par selection nahi- to phoda kya interviewer ka sir.
                we are told to not reveal- are you told to bathe.

        anything you read- implement it- see it happening!!
                20-80 rule- 20% of knowledge makes you normal- to be called master takes remaining.
                        desirable is 20% of knowledge of complete field and 80% of knowledge of your specialization (it can 100% but 80 makes you special)
                        When people say being normal, it is exactly the normal distribution they are talking
                                it is not a normal height- it runs by sd.
                                be normal in your eating/ dressing sense- be like the way most of the people are!!
                                We try to be normal in society! But there are outlaws/ outliers instigated by circumstances
                                KC is not about being normal (even as a utility for peaceful mind)- it is about being absolutely right. Normalcy helps!!
                                Normalcy applies to a continuously measurable parameter.

                Punct and Funct- Plan Punyish
                        Late- extension by factor of 2.

                The now is in your hands, Then is always at distance.
                my bad- I made a mistake (informally) vs I am sorry (formal)
                Plan for all gratifications
                        TG- Service, they are better off than they were- and they say it- seniors, users, community, etc

                Taking full stand/ responsibility/ confidence for what you know is very important.
                        for technical discussions it would be necessary- that you can talk about implementation details, design issues (how to implement usecases), requirements (user experience related), architecture (real world probs- how will you solve; using architecture, how is its architecture)
                experimentation- demo thru case study- ability to answer inputs, outputs specifications for the same.
                JSONParser.parse()
                        does jsonparser parse integers well? be thoroughly technical, man! ability to answer all nuance queries.
                                be mathematical about everything- there are I don't know roads, there are I am not sure (forgotten) roads, there are intuition roads, there are confidence roads (it will work)
                        Grammar for JSON File
                                JSONObject => 
                                {
                                        "Name" : VALUE
                                        [,"Name" : VALUE]*
                                }
                                VALUE =>  Constant | JSONObject | JSONArray

                There's 1 DB that you master
                        can't master all the DBs of the world but 1 gives aptitude for others
                Having your results organized in form of a story is interesting to present and listen.
                Important to get things working- what
                        how you got there- standardizing standard things
                        why something worked and others didn't- complete picture is clear.
                        Eg- I was asked why previous version didn't work- find out! Get working use case- explore all error messages possible.
                Tyrion- Don't do it for your king, kingdom- it's your land they attack- I do my job cuz I love my job. I am crazy for it- I don't do it for anyone but me- it's my gratification.
                        1 of the problems that sucks is living for the sake of it- we want to feel alive all the time.

        Songs
                aa bhi jaa.
                Choom choom chhanana baaje maiyya pav paijaniya- remix also.
                We will join forces
                Hanuman chalisa remix- sounds amazing.
                Jab se ye mukhada, duniya meri gulzaar
        Tell 3 good and 3 bad about college- Sir, can I tell 6 bad.
        Interview- tell what you will say on this?
                Quora type questioning- for survival, better for excitement, better for reciprocation.
                        we will die when we must be but living has to be exciting.
                        maybe it won't work, but what if it does. And it's darn boring without it anyway.
                        Desire level includes but not limited to survival instinct. Eg- ping people for exciting talk so that relp helps achieve more.
                        Fear of not sustaining- that's ok- Winners are those who try- non-tryers just witness others' success.
                        In love you take initiative, but of course, it will have duty (reciprocation) and desire (purpose) under it.
                Ppl want to be kept engaged in sth exciting- no interaction busts them.
                in discussion, figure out which topic you can't speak on- work on it.
        Basal needs
                Be Std mode when with superior- fighter will be wiped.
                        sr has mockright.
                        wonder how much you grow under 'em.
                bud? bebud!! Win-win- game theory!
                non-confront- talk logic! nth personal.
                gone case- no interaction.
        distraught- I was a bit distraught- harry
                bloke- it's one thing for bloke to show up alone.
                loquatious- we don't talk with victor. he is more of physical- I mean he is not much a loquatious being.
                pensive
        Working is an art
                if you have done work- don't let anyone take credit- plan a presentation- take ideas.
                what's your visibility- share ideas- share development- share challenges- feel free to tell I don't know- bluff when caught has its repercussions- they stop sharing.
                your knowledge grows- jobs change but you gotta enjoy your work- enjoy sharing it (teaching skills also).
                In a presentation you can say twice that you are not following- could they elaborate the subject matter. Do a course but be interesting as you express ideas clearly.
                The guy was rejected on the grounds that he was not standing as he spoke (laxity kills it)- the code he showed in presentation was pathetic (no spark- technical part)
        Interesting dialog
                Ek baar ek hero tha. Usne bohot mehnat, padhai. engineering ki. Aur phir usne naukri ki. Phir wo yoon hi zindagi bhar naukri karte karte ek din marr gaya.
                Kya hua?
                Pasand nahi aayi ending?
                To badal do. Tumhari apni kahaani hi toh hai
        Important to accept people the way they are- eg- Narad.
                You hold internal ideals like monkey with croco- to keep externals peaceful for KC, ensure that even demons are treated the way they like. Cuz as long as you are in mat world, politi is game name.
                Trust is by default, when it is broken or repeated we get suspicion and talk it out.
        I believe in thorough (foundational) understanding of what you work on including but not limited to tweeks that serve
                Get 20% feel- thru hearing an expert.
                Get expertize (80%) by reading a good book.
        1 interesting hack is ask for work, ask for proxy server credentials for maven fill it in program files folder files and then log in with your credentials- files can be opened!

                Hi there.
                Welcome to our course on deploying a Hadoop cluster.
                I'm Matt Leonard, I'll be your instructor.
                --bunch of commands now, but I'll make them available
                --However, you're probably watching this from the future so take latest update
                --prefer mirror close to you- to save your time
                Terminate to end the cluster
                charging- rent + usage per hour basis- 15k per night.
        Thinking high of your subords- they become that- the papers you wrote- nth urgent but by that date.
        Problem ignored it grew, greatest helper for patient is doctor, we are just for psychological support
                any problem ask doctor, we are paying for it anyway- ac, parchi, etc.
                Importance of biological, medical field- if we didn't have it.
                Repetition concept get fine tuned.
                Competition 10th small competition- vs IT sector- competition is with across world.
                        we have potential to give a lot- there is no limit to its depth.
                        what a person sitting in german is doing- is shared across globe.
                        Internet has made world really small. Whatever best a person, he bring it out- sum total of all them- sum total be greater than ourselves
                        For the sake of social ideology and person ideology.

            Nutrients
            tougher to shuttle vitamins from food and other sources into your body because cooking, storage, and simple exposure to air can inactivate these more fragile compounds.
            interplay of micronutrients isn’t always cooperative, however. 
                    vitamin C blocks your body’s ability to assimilate the essential mineral copper. 
                    minor overload of the mineral manganese can worsen iron deficiency.

                    gain entry to the blood via lymph channels in the intestinal wall
                    travel through the body only under escort by proteins that act as carriers.
                            Bile is needed for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins
                            vitamins are used throughout the body, but excesses are stored in the liver and fat tissues
                            when needed body taps into the reserves, releasing them into the bloodstream from the liver.
                    perhaps in doses weeks or months apart rather than daily, and still get your fill. Your body squirrels away the excess and doles it out gradually to meet your needs.

            Beans	
                    The lentils in dal provide complementary proteins and some essential amino acids,” says Majmudar. “Grains like wheat (in chapati) or rice provide the other half of the nutritional combination. This forms a dish that is a complete protein source.
                            Cereal proteins are poor in nutritive quality, being deficient in the essential amino acid, lysine and threonine. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine
                            Unlike lysine, which is the limiting amino acid for cereals, the limiting amino acids for pulses were found to be methionine, cystine and tryptophan

            Worth noting
                    significantly larger portion of soy is degraded to the waste product urea
                    contributes to less protein synthesis in the body
                    Whey absorbed much better.
                    help reduce risk of prostate cancer. 
                    Finally, there is no meaningful clinical evidence that suggests soy protein lowers serum testosterone levels or exerts any estrogen-like or feminizing effects in men.
                    contains phytoestrogens called isoflavones that may mimic the activity of the hormone estrogen in your body. The effects of soy isoflavones on human estrogen levels are complex.
                    Soy is safe for everyone to consume in moderation and can have a modest effect on estrogen levels.
                            isoflavones do so more weakly than your body's natural estrogen - regulate estrogen levels - activate if less, interfere if more.
                            may decrease your body's production of estrogen and increase the rate of estrogen degradation due to feedback mechanisms that control estrogen levels.
                            ingesting large amounts of soy isoflavones can have pro-estrogenic effects
                    maize is the only cereal deficient in the amino acid tryptophan
                    lysine is the limiting amino acid of all cereals
                    Rice protein is high in the sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine, but low in lysine. Pea protein, on the other hand, is low in cysteine and methionine but high in lysine
                    Quinoa, soy, and chia seeds are the exceptions to plant based proteins sources.
                    4 essential amino acids missing from most plant foods are lysine, tryptophan, methionine, and phenylalanine. However, you can get all of them from vegetarian sources.
                    need to make sure they're getting enough vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and zinc
                    Maize protein is deficient in lysine and tryptophan but has fair amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids (methionine and cystine). On the other hand, the protein of food legumes is a relatively rich source of lysine and tryptophan but is low in sulphur amino acids (Bressani and Elías, 1974).
                    Conditional amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress
                    Quinoa belongs to species Chenopodium album which is known as “bathua” in India. Rajgira = amaranth, 
                    amaranth, dalia (broken wheat), bajra, brown or wild rice.
                    Every time legumes like beans, lentils, and peanuts are combined with grains like wheat, rice, and corn, a complete protein is born. 
                            Peanut butter on whole wheat is an easy snack that, while pretty high in calories, provides a heaping dose of all the essential amino acids and plenty of healthy fats to boot.
                    Potatoes have all nine amino acids, but they don't have an adequate amount of all of them to be considered a complete protein. Like most other plant foods, potatoes are incomplete proteins. One large baked russet potato has 8 grams of protein, or 14 percent of men's and 17 percent of women's daily allowances.
                    wiki - Generally proteins in cereal like corn are limited in lysine, while pulses like beans are limited in methionine (complementary proteins)

                                    talk about amazon - nth to do with endangered species or delivering sth to home.
                                    idea - do humans deserve to be saved? ares is determined that humans deserve abondonment (no help) and die painfully via chemical weapons (punished)
                                            humans are by nature evil - genocides, environment destruction and made this guy famous.
                                            she responds - it's not about deserve. it's about what you believe and I believe in love.
                                            it's not her duty to help people but wants to cuz likes it. care ethics - mothers care for child even if they are terrible.
                                            like man caring for puppy - ppl don't reciprocate so suck - but still help.
                                            they are everything you say but so much more she says - focussing attention on only the negative side of theirs.
                                            rewarding based on usage vs  - Dr poison deserves to die but she rejects the theory.
                                    like batman deserves gotham. no! but he helps anyway.

                                    Deadpool philosophy
                                            shortcomings - shirks from superhero formula - not greater good, fun for family.
                                                    evades criticisms cuz he has no moral scruples, values to defend. identity is reactionary. fun of eth - no claim to good guy. could not afford another x-man. wo superhero landing.
                                                    damn charming, action, jokes are fun.
                                            don't care attitude
                                                    it achieves it thru fk it. nth taken seriously.
                                                    even ad campaign in deadpool style - gun against the crotch.
                                                    even tinder profile they created.
                                                    post modernism - rejects grand narratives to make sense of world - good and evil, democracy and communism, science or divine salways - the idea of good old days.
                                                            no grand battle of good over evil - just a guy killing bunch of people for revenge and love.
                                                            Dopinder - chialry and compassion to win love - better kidnap current lover.
                                                            relentlessly deconstructs any trope that would endow meaning to film.
                                                    he remains unscathed in high stake situation. Eg - really rolling up the sleeves. (this statement also shows self awareness)
                                                    doesn't anything seriously cuz he has no death - life without consequences - is this life?
                                                    say fk it - cuz death or existential threat is so close or distant that we say don't care.
                                            self aware, conscious, self referencing, being meta

                                                    Hollywood has been so full of it over the years.
                                                    bashing the system while being the system.

                                                    That ain't calculus and I know it - failed it twice.
                                                    Old logic to base morality on maximize overall happiness of society - also ends justifying the means.

                                    destined to get stones
                                            peter loses control - idea was his originally but emotions got better of him.

                                            Dinosaurs had no say in stopping their extinctions - or plague in europe.
                                            narcisist (thinks of oneself) - has everything but rests.
                                                    you will never be god but with all stones and control over space, time and kill half population, he is god. Human will doesn't matter is the say.
                                            the only person stopping was another god figure - non-god didn't do anything.
                                            message is timeless, universal from greek gods. it was amazing but not inspirations - probably they reverse it in next movie.
                                    <Thanos>
                                        Thanos perfectly written villain
                                            others are expendable villains - terrible, don't matter so much - heck, don't even know their names.
                                            even dcu best were joker and wakanda's villain.
                                            general theme is hero being tasked with force for good against villain wanting malevolent goal.
                                            what adds the charm is part ....because...to having malevolent goal. why he feels justified in doing so.
                                            relatable and sympathetic - become heros in certain form.
                                            thanos is different from his source material - most sadistic person in comics.
                                            if live is left unchecked, it will cease to exist. he believes it with eg - after that, the planet has seen full bellies and happiness.
                                            all villains are flawed - understandable beings that are slaves to their imperfections.
                                            altruism driven by his own ego - views himself as god. mercy and then rest.
                                            he is hero of his own story - tortured warrior that seeks vindication from seeing his home destroyed.
                                            represents misguided religious extremist. idea that he truly believes in even at cost of holding dears.
                                            he suffers in the end - he sacrificed for his goal - what did it cost? everything.
                                            without sacrifice lacks emotional weight.
                                                    REL Joker in dark night. vs audience wants to see them defeated cuz show all bad.
                                            sympathy and hatred extreme - understanding in the center was thanos basis.
                                            he deserves audience's sympathy - he respects his opponents. you should have gone for head.
                                            in the end he saw sacrifices of people and lost his own love.

                                    Avengers Infinity War - Ending and Themes
                                            Plot
                                                    cliffhanger - mess to be resolved - what's deeper meaning and what make of it.
                                                    6 infinity stone - unlike others he succeeds.
                                                    Power stone b4 movie ; Loki gives space stone, reality from collection, gamora captured by fake reality
                                                    threatens to kill sister - leads to soul stone; sacrifice 7 you love - kills favorite daughter. Dr strange - o made up names then I am spiderman.
                                                    Time stone kept at name - good except it sucks. could not steal gauntlet so tony almost killed - time stone in exchange of Tony's life - only possible outcome Tony has to be alive.
                                                    Mind extracted keeping him alive - kills stone with vision but time stone rewind and gets mind stone backs and snaps finger.
                                            Expected vs done
                                                    expected 
                                                            with contracts about to end stayed and newer characters faded but movies are coming.
                                                            Let's not forget black panther highest grossing superhero movie.
                                                    undo is possible - so like for mind stone so it is reversible.
                                            soul stone may have importance in reversal. requires a sacrifice so maybe old ones will sacrifice.
                                            honoring the place of tony in MCU - mind has layers - put together to defeat.
                                            Thanatos in greek means death - so Avengers fighting death. In comic does to impress gf.
                                            Eros and Thanatos - 2 insticts - life instincts (sex, desire to survive); death instinct (destructive) - needs the other to exist.
                                            Thanos is talking about balance. In Comics his brother is Eros.
                                            he does random genocide - Malthus philosophy - food supply limited so control population - affected thinking of Darwin and John Maynard. Utilatarianism - action is good or bad based on consequences.
                                                    heroes reject this util mindset - doing right thing in itself in moment - we don't trade lives.
                                            choosing between stone or person of love - they chose person although illogical cuz more deaths later.
                                            Exceptions Quil and Scarlet - sacrifice on the urge of loved ones.
                                            The villain of the movie is protagonist - sacrifices for greater cause he thinks.
                                            vs killmonger - both scarred by past - racism and injustice of childhood. 
                                                    Thanos by overpopulation wreaking havoc on his home.
                                                    pity for what they experienced - some of the logic makes sense but dehumanized.
                                            Thanos - Darth Vader for new generation - odds with nature so sacrifices himself for son.
                                            maybe we are seeing the alternate reality - they are marked for death for final chapter.
                                            Dreamt of having a kid - existing relp with peter parker - Chris says done with marvel movies to move on. His surrogate son disintegrate in his arm.
                                            fans dreaded death of old heros so they showed the unnaturalness of seeing the young erased.
                                            subtext is old heros need to make room for new - now more ready to have old ones die. That's how it should be - old is preventing future for the younger.
                                            Thanos is literally baggage of his past from next generation - takes life of daughter.
                                            family borned into and the ones formed - all death are in some alternate universe.
                                            Loki, etc must be really gone.
                                            rare experience of sequel driver envt - money making characters.
                                </AvengersInfinityWar>
                                <SpidermanHomecoming>
                                    Homecoming inverts this from great power comes great responsibility - does he have responsibility to get power.
                                    impulsive and doesn't see thru the consequences of his use of power - like criminals selling weapons w/o background check.
                                    using powers for frivolous means - takes away his suit for dry cleaning it (so he goes home naked?)
                                    grows up realizing his actions make things explode.
                                    he finds out peter's greatest secret - he still plays with legos and he is spiderman, that too.
                                    criminals had forgotten the pin number at atm so use ray gun. he asks the criminal without warrant cuz this is america.
                                    he gets thrown on head like his son. relax his son was only a baby. he ends up in amazon prime warehouse.
                                    2
                                    obvious takes of uncle ben and spider byte moment - swinging around.
                                    none of that stuff. 2nd reboot so can't have stale.
                                    Marvel ppl know what makes their characters interesting.
                                    spiderman having his own ai - not interested before. Not ironman junior.
                                    moving eyes could not be displayed in b4 spiderman movies cuz would look unrealistic but see spiderman entry in civil war - eyes shut. helps show emotions going thru.
                                    they removed the mask in many movies to see his expressions for fans.
                                    stan lee - masked so anyone can project themselves to him unlike others like superman, etc.
                                    so many monologues by spiderman that makes Aaron Sorkin jealous. previous movies didn't show him talking to himself - spoilt the character. overly talkative he is.
                                    comics had time and freedom to explore small topics for experimentation.
                                    giving lady direction, bike thief and bank robbery.
                                    vulture never into and underwhelmed when told he was villain - but credit to screenwriting.
                                    spiderman having personal connection to peter is interesting not vv.
                                    not confident swinging but boy who feels fears - hollywood powerhouse.

                                        cheque - It's enormous, the size not amount.
                                        why don't you talk to him - I can't cuz I am scared.
                                        does anybody have neighborhood question

                                        that words were of boy who is man now.
                                        say pizza instead of cheese.

                                                        even 1 drone can't go wrong cuz trying to fool 7 billion people - especially Nick Fury who is paranoid and most dangerous on the planet and bullet in my head.
                                                you had access to killer drones - almost killed brad.
                                        you guys tell lies with such ease - smiles like a talent.
                                        So you know too; I have known first and longer but it's not a competition but .
                                        tell us about your gf - he is talking about edith - projectors blipping out cuz they could be faked using same thing and streak of illusions multilevel.
                                                made believe that saved from this illusion thru Nick Fury; Thanks and all then asks who all did you tell this to - you are so gullible ; well they have to die.
                                                smart as a whip but just a sucker. didn't notice the eye latch on his face.
                                                easy to fool people when they are fooling themselves. gave you targaryan shirt cuz you seemed a bit cold.
                                        happy, is it you - tell me something that only you would know. price that it would definitely be adult film. It's you it's you - still hangover.
                                        how can I relax that I messed up so bad. I trusted Beck thinking friend - the only the thing Tony left for me.
                                        no you are not ironman. no1 can live up to that. He was mess and second guess - 1 thing he didn't second guess was picking you.
                                                friends in trouble. tech is missing and you are alone. What will you do? - I am gonna kick his ass - yes but what specifically cuz I have been hovering for last 15 mins.
                                                What's your password - Password just spell it - you are head of security and that's your password - I don't feel good about it either.
                                                it's fake so nothing worry about (wrong assertion)
                                                it's illusion tech - I have to get inside the illusion tech and get inside it, take it down, find him and then he is just a guy so that I can take EDITH right back.
                                                while the suit is being prepared at the runtime - 3-D printing - but this time I will have 6th sense - spider power - you have peter tingle get it back online.
                                                it's not real - well looks very real to me.
                                                informed Nick in a very tricky way - Iron Man surf board he said it was yours cuz you know appearances can be deceiving - that's wrong message don't call me again (but message conveyed)
                                                        with that insight - some random shit was possible to crack.
                                                this is gonna be dangerous, Nick - I appreciate your concern but I never leave my men behind.
                                                it's not real, it's not real - woah it's awesome could see projectors different from the display.
                                                        within the display he was very selective about what to look for; and lo seeker finds the thing.
                                                        web shooters to dismantle the projected image.
                                                I work with spiderman not for spiderman now get on the car.
                                                distracted the drone with a transitive movement and attacked it head on.
                                                throws shield that doesn't hit - how does cap do that.
                                                when so many drones, make a fishnet out of web and crash them on ground as you deccelerate before hitting the ground.
                                        I wasted my life playing video games and seeing the situation we are gonna die. I love spiderman's aunt; ain't we sharing.
                                                I am obsessed with telling truth even if it hurts other people's feelings.
                                                illusion means illusion for him as well so threw his dice in his direction he leaps backwards to save himself buying time for spiderman to attack.
                                                This isn't ideal but I have contingencies for fallbacks.
                                                the illusion reduces with some drones fallen using spider tingle.
                                                his show as a person is also nested inside an actual person so pointer based attack on the world he used to do.
                                                        you told me a lie - that's the most disappointing part you are a good person you deserve that - while he attacks peter thru actual person but peter tingle saves him. never losing focus.
                                                people need to believe and especially nowadays they will believe anything.
                                                EDITH, is it real? - all illusions are down peter.
                                        could you not just wink instead of saying "appearances can be deceiving" - only cuz I had serious doubts from beginning - no he had zero doubts I need to talk to peter - he will call you
                                                ok great but he better or its your ass and don't even think about ghosting me.
                                                go on a double date or something - oh, we broke up said together - men and women grow apart but the journey they share together will always be a part of them.
                                                I kept my identity guarded and faced lot of deception and tired of lies so let truth be out there.
                                                on my way - don't text and swing (instead of drive)
                                                simulated beach sitting - only pixels on screen around you and as you get up the screen changes to sth else.

                                                wanted to join but only women - I always liked women too much - not in creepy way but respectful way.

                                                long you been green and stupid - hulk always hulk. that's very naked - closes his eyes - it's in my brain now.
                                                earth hates hulk - earth loves hulk. bad friend - stupid avenger.

                                                sun's getting really low - will you stop chanting different planet to stress me out - he has the keys and may never come back.
                                                that's so gross you use me - how many PhD Hulk has 0 - Banner has 7 - useful he is.
                                                beautiful strong courageous woman - living in haze to forget the past so drinking too much - you do drink too much - hey, I ain't stopping but get back to what I was.
                                                we are revengers - you want revenge undecided. suddenly plans to do right thing - I have stolen ships.
                                                I went to help snake and he turned it's me. Slaves - I don't like that word - mainframe - why I won't like that - S word - prisoners may run away.
                                                he death split us part
                                                I should stay here - perfect for you chaotic lawless and savage - so low of me - think world of you - paths have diverged long time ago.
                                                doing get help stunt - so ready - betray me round so being predictable - growth and change but you stay same. You will remain god of mischief but could be more.
                                                I hope you are tougher than you look - why? throws him away.
                                                grandmaster used it for orgies - don't touch any stuff.
                                                you are phd fly ship - none of them are for flying alien spaceships.
                                                saw fight and immediately wanted to join the band.
                                                you are in desperate need of leadership. spaceship thru stones stunt.
                                                thought it would be nicer - it is nice but just thought.
                                                by buying a normal guy's ambition she got weapon of pressuring and cajjoling people into secrets.
                                                I love what you did to this place - his solution was to cover it up or to cast it out. you were not worthy she said. gold came from winning and then he wanted peace.
                                                ok get up from my seat - good king should refrain from war - but must always be ready for it
                                                to be honest I expected more.
                                                you wanted to know who I am - you got this you will see - collapses on bridge.
                                                2 eyes saw only half the picture - are you god of hammers or hammer helps you control your power not source of power - asgard is where our people stand not that location. Even now they need help. not as strong as you - no you are stronger.
                                                she will continuing to hunt - what do we do - I am not doing "get help"
                                                shall we - after you.
                                                hela could be defeated by causing ragnarok - enemy's enemy.
                                                tremble before me asgard - I am your reckoning. he destroys asgard and hela with it and this is prophecy.
                                                        he was brought to life like she brought others - same strategy - damage not big if foundation is strong.
                                                what have I done - saved from extinction - asgard is people not place.

                                        losing an eye to see greater reality
                                        preoccupation with past.
                                        past treaties and celebrations - but past was different - blood and conquest, giant wolves - shows 1 under the decoration.
                                        suddenly asgard is what it was before - went to dark to bring past back.
                                        all heroes also went with past to bring their true self. Photo of black widow helped.
                                        she gave up life and became scavenger - heroism she left behind. Loki wanted Thor to recognize him - Loki decides he has to grow from person of the past.
                                        your savior is here and didn't steal tesseract.
                                        fight between asgard's past and future. for future, we need to reckon with past.
                                        people stories about themselves - odin rewrote history from fighters to benevolent protector.
                                        history is written by winners but better, for winners. give a narrative to set a stage for future to happen interestingly.
                                        victory parades, remembrance ceremonies and war museums tell of glory, courage and sacrifice so that nation gets better.
                                                cuz past dictates the future.
                                                Loki was rewriting the history with himself as hero - indulgence and celebration 
                                        dangers of tying political identity and security to a single place.
                                                outsiders become enemy and a potential threat. world full of potential threat - safety is illusion.
                                        visit from ghost dad helped him understand that people of Asgard matter more than place or even name.
                                                Her militarism based on defending the land of Asgard from threats or explansion - would be ruin of the people of Asgard - loses eye for knowledge.
                                                the future based on their past.

                                        black sheep Thor but what changed - connection that never before.
                                        never use half measure when you could go all the way - Breaking bad.
                                        risk of shakespearean dialogue cuz other heros very grounded and relatable.
                                        visually more interesting color and style to spare - creature design, sets, fun performances from new characters - more splashy than b4.
                                        portrayal change - focus on Loki's fun not on Thor - he said felt like held back.
                                        refreshing to see thor ready for betrayal. Loki more goofy but Thor more smart.

                                        technical mastery of cinematography and images created - emotions captured seeing that.
                                        amazing screenplays along with videos - great performance, funny scripts, tone riding the line between dramatic and serious - interesting and endearing.
                                        Jokes are subjective - cool vice reporter on bike but loser on his own planet.
                                                relationship betw the 2 - screen that's difficult to get.
                                        Dan's ain't a jerk - don't take typical stereotypes. Symbiote wasn't gonna kill then accepted. accepted symbiote as close friend. Direction and CG ok not best.
                                        brilliant billionair - wanna belive him is sold - well written and performed when Isaac. Makes him Isaac of bible making him feel like hero - in bible also isaac dies.
                                        sees himself god like figure who survives and not.

                                        if you ask her she will say yes - that's why i won't ask - too scared or too shy - too busy.
                                        thanks - like you seemed helpless without me.
                                        she seems kinda nice - turn off engines then find me a date - I am multi-tasking.
                                        our mission is to rescue hostages - no, that's your mission and you have done it beatifully - what I get my hands on.
                                        that mistake is on me - you are damn right
                                        you didn't share that detail - not obliged, greatest soldier - soldiers trust each other that makes army - last time I trusted I lost eye.
                                                no1 spills secret cuz they don't know all.
                                                lift no1 can enter without authorization - face detection.
                                                granddad loved e1 but didn't trust them very much.
                                                yeah I know ...they are little bigger than 22.

                                        st the best to do is start over.
                                        took so long to come back - I could leave my best girl...especially after didn't finish dance.
                                        laser videos of people to see and talk to them.

                                        do that - but you have to get ironman to my niece's birthday party and he's got to mingle not flyby.
                                        happy now - people giving orders down to zero, so hell yeah.

                                        use my machine cheaper than outside - what's the cost? - a cup of coffee - infectious diseases on clothes.
                                        I don't remember giving you key - you think i will need one.
                                        talking normally but writing on smartphone to communicate - ear everywhere; Shield compromised.
                                        hi captain rogers - hi neighbor
                                        money went thru 17 fictitious account to him.
                                        making world better, gotta tear old one down, that makes enemies. you put your hands in mud for that.
                                        he said not to trust anyone - maybe that included him - but those were his last words.
                                        anticipated plan for fight - b4 we get started does anyone wanna get out.
                                        magnet lock (handcuffs) - this isn't personal - kinda feels personal.
                                        what's in it - I only act like I know eth rogers.
                                        first rule of going on a run is walk. I had exact same glasses - oh, you guys are practically twins (sarcastically)
                                        kiss in public - they won't see cuz makes ppl uncomfortable. still uncomfortable - not the words I would use.
                                        I want you to be my friend - maybe you are in wrong business rogers.
                                        if already working on secret office, why hide elevator.
                                        mind was saved in 200 feet databanks in form of computers.
                                        parasite inside shield. but they would stop you - accidents do happen over a period of time.
                                        sorry, wished you had knocked - saw what shouldn't have.
                                        a "transparent" door showing what's on other side b4 you really open it - they can't see that you can see - like car insider's view.
                                        we are trying to lay low - e1 we know wants kill - not e1. traded KGB for hydra by getting into shield.
                                                using same statement they used - you might in wrong business.
                                        target set on person - why would I do that for you - that tie looks really expensive and I would hate to mess it up (by killing you)

                                        but you won't throw me off, that's not your style - you are right that's her's - that girl what's her name she is cute - not worrying about him cuz another guy.
                                        bypass DNA scans to access helicariers. banners developed medicine to reduce heart beat to one per minute didn't work for him but me.
                                                what secrecy if already dead - didn't know whom to trust.
                                                peace is not an achievement but resposibility declined nobel.
                                                don't look at me - I just do what he doesn only slower.
                                        not kind you save but stop.
                                        price of freedom is high like always but willing to pay it. If alone, so be it but I belive I am not - did you write that first.
                                        how do we tell good guys from bad guys - if they shoot at you, they are bad.
                                        wouldn't you stop with a switch - not if it's your switch - throws glass of wine gestured for favor.
                                        black widow also has some cool gadgets besides stunts and spying intel.
                                        are you ready to let internet see you the way you are - are you?
                                        he returns from dead - did you receive my flower - really, you left me killed - you know how game works.
                                                you are best and ruthless but did to protect people.
                                                I can bring order to lives of 7 billion by sacrificing only 20 million - next time have courage to be able to do it - I have courage not to.
                                        you must have wiped my retinal code but to deal with me you need to keep both eyes open.
                                        fighting saying you are heavier than you look - had a heavy breakfast.
                                        people are gonna die buck ..please don't make me do this.
                                        sees helicariers blasted - what a waste!!
                                        i am on a mission - then finish it cuz i am with you till the end of the line.
                                        world is vulnerable place and we are the best ones qualified to defend it.
                                        data mining hydra's files - looks like not all rats went down with ships.
                                        could use a man of your calibre - I am more of a soldier than spy.
                                        call that nurse ..she is nice lady.
                                        you don't have to come with me - I know...when do we start.

                                            carnage is inherently evil vs venom - symbiote takes on attributes. carnage took on murderer.

                                    Spirit of America represented as hero - 1941 Hitler punching figure.
                                            sends a message what it means to being patriot - serving moral principles you believe in not propaganda.
                                            MCU's moral center - Tony stark represents ambitious egotistical narcissistic capitalist - powers that dominate the USA today. privatized world peace.
                                            Captain America symbol for what America should be.
                                            American dream is more idea than reality - CA is ideal to aspire. CA most in our power to emulate than others - genius billionair playboy philathropists not for all - world class spies or kings but can be morally steadfast people.
                                            he was chosen for moral - I am looking for qualities that ain't physical.
                                                    so Tony's remark that eth special about you came from bottle doesn't hold up.
                                            most avengers are strong - his speciality on sense of right and wrong, courage, willingness to sacrifice - extremely rare. stay who you are - not great soldier but good man.
                                            MCU's message for world also that center be moral.
                                    4 principles of his life
                                            Inner moral compass is strong than his allegiance to any law or govt. 
                                                    Shield takes life for what it is not we'd like it to be. His sense of right and wrong comes b4 anything else.
                                            he is opposed to restriction on freedom. 
                                                    "This is not freedom but fear."
                                            he trusts individual over institutions  
                                                    ppl have not let me down.
                                            Almost against anyone power hungry.
                                    Uses shield - defensive than offensive - his philosophy on war.
                                            stop violence and protect ppl.
                                    WW2 - America emerged from war as global superpower. set self image of country ever since. morally black white film. wakes up in the present day.
                                    he maintains 40s American personality - shit! language.
                                            slowly beat into a cynical state as a culture. He missed Watergate, Vietnam - eth.
                                            he bring good vs evil in 21st century - wartime experiences instilled values in in him. commitment to fight evil - wariness of person amassing too much power.
                                            comics makes him live in modern day with attitude of the past.
                                            Captain America may not fully fit in the present but he's very much needed. the thing to keep from past is unbending sense of morality. Uncomplication sense of goodness associated with US should never go outta style.
                                    I wake up said we won not what we lost - takes time to decipher the good
                                    on a journey from patriot to insurgent
                                            actions morals in sync in first movie - civil war he drops shield - rejection of CA identity. Infinity war he is black dress - different shield as arm guards
                                            representing his new unapologetic vigilante identity - I am not looking for forgiveness and way past asking permission.
                                            what's good guy in today's complex world - save as many people not everybody.
                                            not lip service but staying true to the deepest values that US represented.
                                            dissent can be patriotic - it can mean falling in line, st challenging tyranny. but always what believe in right.
                                    surrender then give up right to choose - shield used tesseract to build weapons. so no more blind trusting anyone.
                                    winter soldier - action against corrupt institutions. 
                                    civil war - he is establishment not proven bad but not perfect but safest hands around.
                                            some party may not fall in line with his moral compass. Talking UN not hydra, shield - run by people with agenda and agendas change.
                                            he has been individualist from beginning - break norms for what's right - staunch individualism is American. Can be seen as arrogant or admirable as you see.
                                    his selfishness
                                            represents exceptionalism - national character sets it apart - danger to overstep boundaries - like America claiming as world policeman or schoolyard's bully.
                                            how do you govern your extra power - rules for that.
                                            embodies best self but reflects some struggles and dangers in today's world.
                                            cap's journey represents national shortcomings intrinsically related to our core principles.
                                            2 sides both belive they represent "right" US.

                                            his twitter account as if being cap - please vote. speaking up when politically don't agree.
                                            promotes unity - I support republican speak - not left right, right wrong.
                                            very humble guy. he is so hug-able.
                                            represents positive masculinity
                                            listen to women on #metoo - criticism on baby carrier man being ridiculed - uncertain of your masculinity that you concern over with such.
                                            from macho idea to warm more nurturing idea of strong modern guy.
                                            ww2 - fighting fascism now holding to higher moral ground when fails to live up.
                                            #VPN - going by ferry vs by submarine.

                                        Hey Hank I just wanna ..- Save it - while you were busy relaxing we were building this tunnel to quantum realm.

                                                wow! that's what I was thinking.

                                        freeze says police who are you - no1 gets the concept of mark... I did 80% of your job and that's how you pay me
                                        take off your hood and talk to me.
                                        Peter secrets have cost and they are not for free.
                                        promising on rat; we will take it to primate lab - but he can't wait ..he must until he wants to be a lab rat.

                                                landing on 20th floor brings suspicion - and people go with 20% confidence as 100%
                                        spidey is assaulting people...he is clumsy..he leaves clues we are gonna get him says Gwen's dad.
                                                he objected (thereby revealing a part of him) - he looks like public service guy no.
                                                car thief was leading us to the person .. we could catch him easily but it was our strategy ..you must have heard the term.
                                                he didn't know that - so you are saying he is hero internet would make you believe.
                                                he was doing what police can't - you think we eat doughnuts all day with thumbs up our asses - up your what dad?

                                                let's go get some air, peter.
                                        I wanted to tell you something...I have been bitten - so have I.
                                                Ok I gotta tell this one thing about vigilante and car thief - she pulls away saying ok.
                                        spiderman comes in screaming incoming.
                                        how would predator track a reptile - reptiles on top of most of food chains ; why sudden interest in the cold blooded.
                                                they gotta have vulnerabilities - they can be aggressive when threatened - doc you alright - never been better.
                                                observation made that eventually the rat had become like reptile eating meat breaking its cage and he can conclude sth about doc.
                                        he gave my daughter mentorship and you will have me believe that he in his spare time runs around streets dressed like dinosaur. Do I look like Tokyo Mayor to you?
                                        sees an advertisement for proofs of lizard - that gets peter enthusiastic about his photography skills extended by spidey powers.
                                        eyesight improvement, improvement in blood clotting rate - his science not leaving him under the gutters.
                                                not about curing ills but finding perfection. increasing his dosage every day.
                                        spiderman made a jhoola in the gutters and playing pinball there until time comes to fight.
                                        movement in 1 thread tells spiderman the source of motion and he gotta go there - smart guy.
                                        when thread break photo gets taken IOT.
                                        by telling Gwen he gets access to get to her any time he wants.
                                        Can't have cocoa ..not now cuz now cramps and pukey and emotional...keep crying and you don't wanna know - got it.
                                        police work so never know if he will make to home.
                                        Spiderman once more guilty - I gave him equation and made it possible for him.
                                                spidey's father kept it a secret for a reason. once more my responsibility.
                                        lizard - let's enhance humans on evolutionary scale. one has to adapt to survive. Give up the confinement of the human body.
                                        we can cure them - you are not thinking straight doc ..this ain't you.
                                        ok so you don't wanna talk ...web sling on his mouth...there you go.
                                        oh oh somebody's been a bad lizard. Saves Gwen by throwing her outta window and himself buys time by Gwen's attack thru chair.
                                        surrounded the college - Peter escapes from where lizard entered sewers.
                                        I need blue serum Gwen can you get me that.
                                        stronger human beings not possible - weak, pathetic and feeble minded. Stronger smarter.
                                                wants forced transmutation cuz ppl are unwilling and recording for eternity.
                                        lizard shot down but regenerates and fires the serum at them.
                                        Gwen fires drill and generates fire for auto-firing of CO2 starts and doors lock - great difficulty for lizard to enter.
                                                sits in corner with fire and perfume - on detection, fire on him with perfume.
                                        bleeding so use web to stop it. trouble of spiderman gotta fight villains and humans that don't understand him and use great power to stop him.
                                        the brave builder helped spiderman sling thru to oscorp tower.
                                        stretchable web so pull and dive into the sky to get to the top of the building of oscorp.
                                        have to give this to spiderman - your bf is guy with many masks, I get it.
                                        ?revolve and kick him back.
                                        spiderman uses liquid nitrogen to his advantage in the fight.
                                        web sling broken and now the tower collapses - his power diminished is vulnerable to him so jumps b4 crash which would throw him from top of oscorp.
                                        he saves him by the right hand which breaks then left hand.
                                        I was wrong about you - you will make enemies, people will get hurt - st closest to you.
                                                so promise me sth - leave Gwen outta it. Very tragic for spidey.
                                        pretty girl asked her - I am not good at that - if there's one thing you are good at that's being good - talk to me.
                                        Son, you have been living since childhood with many unresolved things. Those things send us down a road - they make us who we are.

                                                come on home Peter you are my hero and I love you.
                                        nice shirt flash - the spidey dude is crazy but girls dig him so what to do.
                                        in fiction 10 types of plots as per my prof but I say it's 1 - who am I?
                                                Peter you being late we can count on - won't happen again miss - don't make promises you can't keep - but those are the best kind.

                                    special effects of the movie is really good but dialogues not so much.

                                    who was kissing - peter or spiderman.
                                    settle down boy - no i have no intentions of settling down. you could not find this guy.
                                    she wants to ensure you won't do sth stupid ...sth you regret later.
                                    this is sth else. 
                                    this is symbiote they bind to survive and difficult to unbind.
                                    rent? - not now - it is a free country - not a rent free country. fix the damn door - he is good boy must be in some kinda trouble.
                                    doesn't even want to take off his costume and feels less without it.
                                    spiderman killed him - he doesn't kill - i thought you would...he deserved it - revenge takes over you. It turns us into sth ugly.
                                    I feel bad about how I spoke to you last night - it's alright but if you really feel bad you can buy me pizza sometime. today's good.
                                    if calling a woman say you are good woman. I am a good man ...that's all.
                                    I was feeling alone ; is it ok if I stop by.

                                    drink, peter. what was i thinking, mr key to the city.
                                    he resorts to venom when troubled by friend.
                                    he loved me - no he despised you; you were embarassment to him. look at junior gonna cry.
                                    i never thought you could do it - you gave judgment call see there it is. gotta see things as they are.
                                    you're trash brock - excuse me. gimme break - you want forgiveness get religion.
                                    i have not printed retractor in 20 years.
                                    venom amplifies characteristics of its host especially aggression.
                                    all this was for her? ; I am so sorry MJ - no time wasted on making someone feel bad.
                                    what's your problem - you - can i help you sir - eth ok here paul - get him outta here - take hands off me and fight - who are you - i don't know.
                                            who looks villain here - peter parker for no fault of his own. some aggressions are just accepted - others are not.
                                    such tight grip that he can't take costume out.
                                    hurt : vocab. i hurted her - so do the hard thing to forgive yourself.
                                            find a way to put it right.
                                    so much wrong for 7 else taken as culprit for uncle ben. Harry took spiderman for culprit but butler clarified.
                                    my spider sense is tingling if you know what i am talking about.
                                    saale dosti baad mein nibhana pehle dushmano ko maar.
                                            i saved you - coming a little early would not have hurt.
                                    heat on sand making him glass and breaking.
                                    James wanted a photo - asks kid if he wants a job.
                                    100 bucks for camera - take it you little crook.
                                    any idea - hang on - to what.
                                    web sling on friend to hang on while saving MJ.
                                    hey peter, am I interrupting says while fighting.
                                    not elegant story but on second thought good story may not be best one maybe a little stretched, but excellent special effects and dialogue good kind.
                                    never wound what you can't kill.
                                    eddie take off the suit - you would like that won't you.
                                    powerful but you lose yourself - i like to be bad.
                                    realized that same sound behavior got venom sick so makes connection of falling sticks.
                                    i am not asking you forgive me but just want you to understand - every night spend wishing i could take it back - I have done terrible things too.
                                    I didn't choose to be this. The daughter was dying to bank hack. Uncle trying to help but friend running past him and gun in hand so mixed up.
                                    Brock chose to die with the venom so much in love for his new avatar.

                                They caught a shark - but not the shark. ate a car - I am chief - I can do anything.
                                I going to find shark - in water, difficult to find on land

                                you should mention I am black - my black boyfriend is coming this weekend!! is this what I should say.
                                        I don't want him to chase me off the lawn - he would have voted for obama the third time and it would suck him talking about it.
                                you threw cigrette away - it is as good as you just threw a dollar away outta window - yes, the one you spent on nicotine.
                                you got a wrong guy you know that - yeah, yeah it is just a play to get to you.
                                why he shows id ..I was driving - we have right to ask when incident asks - that's bullshit.
                                        that was hot. I won't let anyone f*k with my man.
                                eyes stealing - see and as soon as 7 sees turn your eyes and continue doing that.
                                We are huggers - frucking weird that deer - I hate them grateful you did that to them.
                                she is right, I am wrong - better get used to saying that - do you have an off button, I am done.
                                sovenier to experience another person's culture so I bring these collections.
                                white people black servants - I was not gonna take it there.
                                where are your manners - our guests wanna hear the stories.
                                He bit tongue on first kiss - I will be very careful from now.
                                Let's karate - you know the rule no play-fighting the drunk dudes.
                                I already told you this could happen - but you know I don't like to be wrong.
                                wanna try - you dangle pocket watch in front of people, is that it? - you watch a lotta tv.
                                gave in to the trial of psychiatrist and lost into sinking later on.
                                whatsapp photo of dog - my dog got drunk!!
                                what's his deal - his whole vibe was hostile. not what but how he said.
                                handling so many people - smile - you think I can do that.
                                how handsome is he? - I don't know are you handsome.
                                black is in fashion these day - excuses himself saying I am gonna go take some pictures.
                                I hate to tear you away but 7 was calling you. shit ain't fair man.
                                so you are so sexy that people are unplugging your phone?
                                I got hypnotised last night - nigga get outta here. you ain't getting in my head.
                                        they could have made you bark like dog or whatever or fly like pigeon - sex slaves.
                                        I am just connecting the dots bruh, probably all of them are hypnotised.
                                The bitch is crazy!
                                she got in head and didn't work - now I'm thinking all this fucked up shit that I don't want to think about.
                                first hit she was saved but cold and alone got her.
                                fire is reflection of our mortality - born, breathe and die - what's you life's purpose - right now, it's finding those keys.
                                        we are gods in coccoon.
                                        mind is a terrible thing to waste.
                                with your gifts and our determination we could be part of something greater, something perfect.
                                he has been missing and here is his photo - doesn't look missing to me - cuz we found him.
                                        he didn't dress like this and he married woman twice his age - that would explain his clothes.
                                abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them sex slaves - never say I don't do anything for you guys see wonderful joke.
                                I will control motor functions so I will be me. you remain as a passsenger - limited consciousness listen and eth but can't respond.
                                3 phases - hypnosis, mental or psychological preparations, transplantation.
                                why black - stronger, cooler, faster - black is in fashion 
                                How did you find me - I am TS motherfucking A - we handle shit.
                                Cotton saved the show - he scratched the seat to get cotton - used cotton to shield ears completely.
                                        take away their instruments away to hypnotised gets you for quite some hours - throws it away.
                                        learning that camera flash undoes the hypnosis - used when he was about to throttle the protagonist.
                                Rose didn't want that cop to see his ID in case Chris went missing that way she wouldn't be a suspect
                                trying to look out for Chris because of missing blacks
                                at the beginning he said he doesn't wanna get chased off the lawn with a shot gun, and thats what exactly happened 
                                that moment said "I'd rather die than have a White person controlling my body."
                                black male worker starts running it was hinting cuz grandfather also did - good foreshadowing
                                looked up when Chris went upstairs? lust to own his body as theirs. They're drawn to him like hungry jackal's looking at a meal
                                        thin line between admiration and appropriation - much like them looking up to blacks. But instead of admiration, she appropriated blacks

                                    do you blame her cuz she blames herself. It was no one's fault. cut off the sound cable and continue to have his plane.
                                    prepare for time to come - eg - arrange that tough situation - we will set the whole muhalla on dj - that way we will be able to talk or do sth.

                                            sth awful happened here, ed. Rory stays here but always sad.
                                            it has latched itself to ppl. It can be like gum - you take it with you.
                                            it may increase cuz we are a threat. Gotta prove to the church, gather evidences.
                                            asking sympathy - gotten it then gotta accept the package of negativity etc.
                                            that's where rory hides when he is afraid.

                                    Notes from IT and Conjuring Movie
                                    If I was benny, I will want us to find me.
                                    I am glad to me meet you before you died.
                                    how do I look? How about that?
                                    wow! cool, huh! No, Nothing cool.
                                    nerd alert. 
                                    deformed face, headless, blood coming out, sink shower, lots of ppl, will this tablet help me.
                                    changing face, vomit blood, hoarsing of voice, sharpening of voice. Not making sense
                                    not working as should wherein no control but observer, changing of the realm.
                                    like a brat stopping your every move to safeguard. orchestrate door closing, unzip clothes to reveal jokers.
                                    talking weird, deformed shop. torso missing, door with labels scare levels
                                    singing random outta context, unnatural speed.
                                    TV speaking to you. yes, kill him.

                                    what if his father comes, do what you always do - start talking.
                                    all bacteria and fungi - not a sanitary place.
                                    we can't leave it like that. dangers but love matter far more.
                                    Name of the group is Losers - hanging out with us makes you loser too.
                                    trash mouthed.
                                    Hey, can only virgins see this stuff - reason why I have not seen this.
                                    used stones to hit from distance - power lies where you believe.
                                            change the game, if you ain't winning at that.
                                            numbers won.
                                            he will be after you after this - was he not already.
                                            Cicadas - bugs come out every 17 years. analytics - you will do what you like anyway.
                                    it's not one thing - we all saw sth different - saw what scares you the most.
                                            saw leper walking infection. but none of this is real.
                                            and the woman I keep seeing - is she hot?
                                            becoming researcher of the shit.
                                    It saw us and knows where we are - geekily it always does.
                                    it's summer - if only you say it one more time.
                                    you don't have to come with me - what happens when another georgie goes missing.
                                            are we going to pretend that it didn't happen.
                                            wow, he didn't stutter once.
                                            don't breathe thru your mouth, then you are eating it.
                                    missing - it's playing tricks on you.
                                    remember the poster couldn't be real so this ain't.
                                            very scary was chosen - don't decide based on personal avoidance of fear but what's right.
                                            I saw the well, so well prepared next time.
                                            stop trying to get others killed too.
                                            that's what it wants, it wants to divide us - we are alive cuz of togetherness.
                                            fear inducer fears himself.
                                    your medication is bullshit, they are placebos - what does placebo mean? bullshit.
                                            no signatures, I didn't want signature book to get dirty.
                                            bully shitting, sudden attack to predator can be a power with some brick wall.
                                            what do you want - see the guy I am hitting, I am pretending that's you.
                                            LOSER - S changed to V.
                                            these are gazebos - bullshit (placebo changed to gazebos)
                                            I gotta go see my friends.
                                    If we stick together we win.
                                    Good Cheer Good Friends.
                                    you got quarter, you ain't making wish in that one.
                                    You laugh, you cry. You cheer, you die.
                                    You left me, you are not my friends. seeing them together he ran away.
                                    kiss and she comes back.
                                    I want more than anything for you to be home.
                                    stretching and unwinding from cupboard to become joker.
                                    I too want but you ain't Geeorgie.
                                    extra power, extra speed, extra sharp teeth.
                                    Not 1 but all - feed on fears. OR I take only him and you grow and thrive.
                                    Leave, I am sorry I dragged you into this.
                                    It's your fault - brought me to dirty waters, sucking house (angry joker), miss summers 
                                            and now I will have to kill this f* clown.
                                            inspite of all power, he was no match to the togetherness of children.
                                            you didn't kill Beverly cuz she wasn't afraid, nor are we.
                                            now you are afraid cuz you are gonna starve.
                                            I know what I am doing for my summer experience essay.
                                    when age of parents, then it comes back, then we come back too.
                                            ppl calling losers to making banner outta that - losers.
                                            never felt like loser with all of you - but winner.

                        cockroaches don't give birth to butterflies
                        I have heard rumors - that's what they are.
                                massacre, pogroms, 
                                how is it home if there is fear.
                                list of names with addresses - tutsi and their supporter hutus.
                                Prez plane shot down by hutus - for agreeing to give too much power to tutsi rebels.
                                        pack few things for kids - leaving tonight.
                                going door to door and roadblocks all over - walking into the lion.
                                neighbors - one night. at least women and children
                                UN needs you leave the country - I want to talk to commanding officer.
                                I will be fine - I am a soldier.
                                changing the track - we don't tempt devil.
                                who are these? my sister and her children - where are your papers? stupid of me to forget - see, we are just going to supermarket be back very shortly.
                                        just give us a break, buddy.
                                        taking authorized officer to corner - see I am a party member taking her to run some errands - let's talk to colonel.
                                        I understand I work for the party - lock the doors - won't do - accelerate the car to people for some hope - at least die killing the bastards.
                                just sing song - be strong, take courage.
                                lay low this thing can't last forever.
                                we can get past roadblocks they are not trained soldiers.
                                UN buses taking only white people - at least drive with them for some assurance - others also boarded.
                                we are just defending - we know who are perpetrators - you can see from washington.
                                things are really out of control - if you don't stop there will be consequences - there is no oil here why should you come here - you will be held personally responsible.
                                took a stand on radio station for an ideology - but must have triggered people - there is no blood on his hands.
                                Bollywood Kapoor's mother - saved by playing dead in that time and children under her. Smartness!!
                                jam radio - radios don't kill people - people kill people - ? but they incite them to..
                                we stay together - think of them as daughter - my daughter isn't cockroach - solution all of them are dead - but some of them are saved.
                                she got one of their weapon grade and removed the pin.
                                When a man leads assassins, he is also an assassin
                        why do they call cockroach - cuz they don't know any[thing] better sweetheart.

                                    You brought me to this way and now you have known the way.

                                    if not come to you, understand I have gone to 7.
                                    not living that 1 day for 8 years.
                                    mein nikal loonga phir kalle paal lena bhains ko.
                                    10 tak ginunga- 1.2.3...(she counts remaining numbers fast)
                                    Boli bhi ek si- kapade bhi- par pataa nahi naraaz kyun hain?
                                    Meri haisiyat chhoti hai- haisiyat himmat ke aage chhoti pad jaati hai.
                                    theek ho- ab hoon.
                                    Only 1 person came on bus- only 1 spark is sufficient to ignite/ spread. Nafrat/ muhabbat takes 1 kaleja for expression.
                                    I am confident- aman ki ek aawaz bhi dushmani ke shor par bhaari hai.
                                    wah ji maut dete nahi ho aur jindagi chheen lete ho.
                                    Sarabjeet- last time to apno ne bulaya tha- gair to mein bhi nahi, bhijan.
                                    do mins bhaith jao- not many ppl come here
                                    google- can search anything but god.

                                    hausla chadd gayaa- ab to sirf zidd baaki hai.
                                    manzil kitni unchi kyunna ho, raaste kadmon tale hi hote hain.
                                    naseeb mein yakeen karte hain- mutthi mein band to ho jaati hain but kaabu mein nahi aati
                                    naseeb to unke bhi hote hain, jinke haath nahi hote.
                                    revenge for kasaab- or rather a plan.
                                    aap dekhein haq zaroor milega- kya dekhen- aankhein to patharaa gayeen hain.
                                    aap ke liye jang hogi, hamare liye to ek chaal hai.
                                    ab to apna karam bhog raha hoon- itni kaun si badduain lag gayin.
                                    whole country is with you. kya galti ho gayee, uske baad ka ek ek pal- mein pagal na ho jaun.
                                    if you back out- I won't complain- aap hatengi- no, I won't. I am fighting for bro, me too.
                                    why enemy and terrorist in them- try hugging- you will find a bro.
                                    now you have power and strength and hence can help others. More bhaashan and taaliyan- but all are jokes- including me cuz cudn't do anything.
                                            oye tu menu sarabjeet bana diya- sarabjeet di pein- why did you have to be so?
                                            you say others see brother in me; I say see me in him suffering same torment.
                                            he's alive cuz there's issue on his name- cuz of your efforts- not futile. Never back out!
                                    No, freeing him would mean killing of others. we don't want it.

                                    you are not businessman, you don't understand the pain of loss
                                            why you didn't stop - cuz you care only kalaa and not sweats and tears for business.
                                    Doctor - get well else who will pay me
                                    You chose to get pictured - great kalakar. Used and threw. You are not outside of my kalpana.
                                    We won't remain but art remains and that way me too.
                                    they judge my art and my life cuz art is my life. The culture ain't so brittle to break on such pic.
                                    celebrate your being - even lust. Chhota sa svarthi lalchi kalakar.
                                    should we restrict art - jail. art, science and religion - can they converge.

                                    He drives away - what you seeing? not seeing, thinking the fool I was.
                                    Oh! You don't value what you have easily available. I was looking for parents.
                                            Never give such child vs dhanya hai child like you. You are adopting parents not child!
                                            they wanna consume least and give the most - they would choose to go crazy in reciprocating with his love although outta his own need.
                                    Could not carve the child but in diamonds, no1 can challenge me.
                                            Market shoots up for his supply.
                                            Give blood to my daughter - take any money - again business.
                                            You said no and here you are- I would help even stranger what of child.
                                    Gave donation, at least meet the child - that's it! Shadow has to go with the body - I leave with hubby.
                                            Plz don't leave. You invest on things that double - what about me! Give double of my blood's 300$ - huh! You impoverished rascal! I donated that.
                                            I don't want riches that make parents desti. Stay at distance. I will do Prayashcit on their behalf.

                                    If Anand seems a character, it's my mistake.
                                            Dava Daaru is his expertise. Only Dava. Thru the book, I am expanding Anand's friend circle - his tendency.
                                            B4 1 died, another born to die. Bring a bahu - I can't leave - Ok set table; food's better than wife.
                                            You are cancer expert - dene mein ya theek karne mein.
                                    Blouse tight - check blood cholesterol - open any shop then - milkman then water; lawyer then would help murderers; here at least reducing pains.
                                    Kai baar mein shak ka ilaaj karta hoon- don't you think sth is wrong.
                                            neither you will understand; nor I can understand.
                                            Trivedi ka dost hai - although uncurable - give him nice time.
                                    Hi You got married I heard - sheh, 3 years and not 1 compounder ; you consult Trivedy Dr (he is Dr)
                                            2 ya 3 bas aur apne - 2+3 = 5.
                                    But you were going to come 2mro. I was born 1 day b4. I think I will die 1 day earlier.
                                            Boriyan laya, bistira nahi laaya - we will accomodate u.
                                            We were seeing your x-ray - Oh, My film! What's my prob? I will tell Trivedi - oh why?
                                            If I say lymphocercoma what you make of it? What a name, like a viceroy, Bimari ho to aisi ho.
                                    Serious now! You know what it means for you - I won't live more than 6 months and here's a medical name for it (abstraction)
                                            Why you got angry. You are angry with urslf that you can't cure it. Babumoshai, eto paasha bhaalo nai.
                                            Doctor, can I check you? - Nabz is here! - Shhh..., Your age 30 you have only 70 years left cuz ur problem is body.
                                                    Maut ek pal hai; the 1M seconds that I will live for next 6 months what of that?
                                                    Zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahi. Maut ke darr se jiya hi nahi to zindagi kya hai.
                                            itni jaldi brought you aap to tum - see, less time so gotta do it fast.
                                    I will examine you for next 2 days - do with delight - this examination that examiner has to study.
                                            Trivedi told me to not joke with you - sorry, habits die hard.
                                    when symptoms manifests it is late so can't do.
                                            Sister, call me if needed - where going come gossip - on duty - then who will take care of me.
                                                    Talk to mirror - that's boring.
                                                    Can't we break rules? - gets angry - kyun, why break.
                                                    So delighted, nurse took him to be relative of patient.
                                            This is like school; a teacher came and now headmaster - this is patient - Oh...- Oh! Let's go to cabin.
                                                    I heard you talk a lot - shut up! - what talk is that? - Lie down - 1 can't even die in 'shut up', sister
                                                    1st obstinate like child literally. I said lie down - take quilt and hides face inside.
                                    Surprised he was laughing at death or life.
                                            you should stay there - agar zinda rehna zaruri hai then stay alive where he laughs.
                                            Nursing room mein to healthy bhi patient nazar aata hai. I haven't come for ilaaj. I will stay not long, can I with you.
                                            Ramu kaka who cooks - I - I have only 2 tastes - eating and bakwas karna. see healthy, masha allah.
                                            Plz come 2mro to home - why? Celebrating 3 year old mistake. Oh, happy aniversary - Mistake was his; I was the victim of his mistake.
                                            I told him a lot not to take me - he brought me here - I understood.
                                    I have come all the way here to meet you bhabhi
                                            what? Plz sing that song for monkey - oh, he told - no, it's astrology. Chehre se man ki pustak padh lete hain.
                                            I also know father beated you b4 marriage. You'd visit theater and dhoom dhaam at home.
                                            Ab jhagade se kya faayada suna do na - Plz bhabhi - haan bhabhi - husband also "haan bhabhi" - aap kyun? - flow flow mein.
                                            Sure come for aniversary. Bhabhi tell what flowers you like? I will bring booke - Don't bring, We don't take presents! - Then? Cash!?
                                            Koi Takalluf na karein .. only party - mein to nahi karunga par aapko karna hoga - itni variety ho na space bache table par..na pet mein.
                                            Now you sing - we know you are great singer - same astrology! gaao na organ bhi rust kha rahaa hai!
                                    Song - maine tere liye hi 7 rang ke sapne chune....choti baton ki hain yaadein badi.
                                            taunted 7 along - kyun mote!
                                            Hi Madanmohan, how is jaggery biz - I am Chandra Mohan and I do oil biz- both biz are good, no prob changing.
                                            No, I always did - If had different name, will u have changed? or ur biz. Yahin milte - aapse milkar khushi hui. Aapko hui?
                                    Pain shifting. Take it out.
                                            what doing there? Prayer. Baatein bahut karte ho - yes, can't live w/o it that's why ran.
                                            Patients are like children - so I wonder why "sister"
                                    Focus on problem dialog to bring attention of audience to ground fact and testing.
                                    Wife worships husband - sadaa sukhi raho - bhagavaan aapki god bhare - paaji! - bhagavan ko aise nahi kehte!
                                            You can forget invitation not me - her beti and me sir - not today.
                                            Sir neeche karo nahi to fir partial kahoge.
                                    Hari Om Svaha - ye kya mantra khatam nahi hua..kanya var ke samne aa gayii..
                                            what's the problem? Zukam. Tell truth. Seedhi bhasha mein bimari hi nahi lagti..yahi mein kehta lymphocercoma of nose, u'd say wah, kya bimari hai.
                                            What bhai, u are bhabhi - no bro, then I will call by name! - baith saale kab se khada hai!
                                            jyotish said I will live 80 - abhi to interval bhi nahi hui. U believe in babas - I believe in mouni babas' words
                                            Go 2 him - mar gaye. Oh so all patients are guided there ..that's why biz he said is going down - will go? yes, ur guru mine. Pray for me? I always do, need not say.
                                            what blessing I give - can't say get my life years.
                                            chhue mujhe koi par nazar na aaye.
                                            5 mins silent and I suffocate. bless him for remove disease - can I live for 200 yrs and no fever?
                                            Sharir to mit raha hai har pal - brows her.. so why ask body..tell me mind that is happy and makes happy.
                                            Crying and then onion comes. Why after onion. No he is after me. Once wife comes no space for u - what my luck. I ain't talking abt u - I know ...in this age?
                                            shadi 1 sided to ho nahi sakti - social interest mein lagaa hai and no interest in self.
                                    U liked 7 and touched them - aye, where u go. Stop here!
                                            Murari Lal! I don't know anyone of that name.
                                            Ishq, Balubashi - tell me where that lady is for whom I have taken this garland.

                                            Is doctor here? yes, he is expert ; one who meets him starts playing cricket but u are girl - u will play badminton.
                                            Tell details - aap sochoge bhabhi mujhe kaise pataa - anand? - sorry, bhaiya abhi bhabhi nahi.
                                            Will u plz shut up? yes yes. Jab Anarkali or Salim dono khamosh hain mughaleazam kyun bole jaa raha hai?
                                            If feelings are only mine then let me know so that no sharmindagi. Anand ne baandh tod hi diya hai to keh hi dun.
                                            Tum chaloge..haan haan chalo - maine to jhoot moot kaha tha ye taiyar ho gaya.
                                            Only God can save him - does he know - yes - still.. Even God can't live w/o such  person.
                                            Zindagi kaisi hai paheli - Sapno ka rahi kahin na chala jaaye sapno se aage.
                                            where are u going? police station, tera warrant nikalwane.
                                            Are dont' sit there - nth of it - u also sit. Listen - what nai did, bhai do now.
                                            daan dahej dene ke liye mere paas kuch nahi - are, ladke ke paas bhi kya hai.. aspirin ya penicillin.
                                    Won't return for byah? Nahi maaji, bahut rash hai wahaan...and no return ticket.
                                    muh to meetha karke jaa - itne saste mein nahi hone waala - 2 din mein aaunga - apne haath ka khaana.
                                    losing beti but getting beta .. may god give 100 yrs - I will leave.
                                    how u left? emergency it was - let's break girl's feet..no1 interested..hope aap mulakat nahi karenge - mulakat nahi mukalat hi hogi.
                                    Dhool chaihye - oh is pavitra akhade di dharti nu dhool nahi kahida
                                            nahi charana di dhool. Bhagavan di shakti da roop ho tussi.
                                            je shishya banana i te pa langot utaar kapade te ho ja shuru
                                            aapki shakti dekhke dhool mangi thi nahi to ppl like us can't protect self nor related. Ki hoya? Some ppl disturbing girls coming going.
                                            Papaji pehle mein jaata hoon- time pe aa jaana meri chatni na ban jaaye.
                                            Papaji tussi great ho - tussi saksat bhimsen ho - jeete raho beta ghatokach.
                                            Maine ghar chaan mara aur tum bhagavaan se gappen ladaa rahi ho.
                                            Babumoshai theek ho gaye - thank god, I started identifying symptoms and started searching for medicine but b4 that medicine searched him.
                                            Mujhe hi fikar hai apkko nahi - bhagavaan se apne liye nahi dusro ke liye bhi maangna chahiye.
                                                    Today I was asking for self (actually him).
                                                    Crying - ohho ho - so weak - ed talk to god, this power he has given.
                                            Crying that sd I may leave and not happy that he is standing right in front.
                                            Namaste! - Sat Shri Akal - ye hamare pehelwaan dost ne hame sikhaya hai.
                                            I have come to tell u not friend - ok, say low volume else he is burn in jealosy.
                                                    tell him u came to meet - jump to sofa - yes, see burnt in jealosy.
                                            Another Murari Lal - oh, you were so naughty when young. Jayachand not anand he is..so I am Isabhai not Murari Lal.
                                                    Aapka naam to bhaskar hi hai na. Guru ruk - nahi chele mein late ho jaun.
                                                    mein bhi acting karta hoon. Anand bhai se bhi milne aai thi - anand se mil li - bhi se kahaan mili?
                                    Play
                                            I can't allow u inside - I understood abba huzoor.
                                            I will bury u alive - bet, if bury it won't remain alive.
                                            why u not died at birth - we take birth and die at God's will - we are puppets of theater and God makes us dance.
                                            Kaisi lagi? Bahut Khoobsurat thi!! - Kaun?..maine rehearsal poochhi.. achi but ladki zyada acchi hai - oh, rajni ben- ben hogi teri.
                                            zubaan se maar kha gaye guru.
                                    Met a girl no gujrati - in 1 yr will learn Babumoshai? I know next lifetime I will start with Gujrati.
                                            U leaving outside- yes, but u don't come! - see bhabhi cat has become lion now.
                                            You had a letter. I won't go even if PM calls me. Bombay has all ppl - Punjab Sindh Gujrat Maratha..
                                            Bebasi of Doctor waiting when all options are over.
                                            Pretending sleep - suddenly catches what murmering silently, tell. I was praying to Jesus - no, u don't know I worship Shiva - they may fight.
                                                    but they don't know my anger also - I will come as your child next life.
                                                    should not make 7 cry right? I want ppl to laugh but ended up them crying - when happiness crosses threshold.
                                                    correct, where she will get child like me and u devar like me - see the gift I brought.
                                            Nice moments I'd record and listen and relive those special moments.
                                            No1 has seen death but I see it unfortunate ...in ur eyes.
                                            Our problem is coming problem is mixed with current pleasures and make them insipid.
                                            Zindagi aur maut to uparwaale ke haath mein hai jahaan panah use na to aap badal sakte hain na mein. Ham to rangmanch ki kathputliya hain jinki dor upar waale ke haathon mein bandhi hain.
                                            Kab Kaun Kaise Uthega koi nahi bataa sakta hai - hahaha...gets attack.
                                            I have medicine more powerful - vishvas.
                                            wah, marte marte chela guru ko sikha gayaa. dukha apne liye rakh anand sabke liye.
                                            khud to haal se taaliyan le gaye - hamare liya kursiya chhod gaye - kya karoon mere dialogues hi khatam ho gaye else I'd have devoured you also. You bet!
                                            We will compete up there. If want will bring Gujrati stuff ...no, I will take time learning Gujrati.
                                            Chalta hoon fir aunga milne..kahaan yahin..curtain won't fall so easy.
                                            Good ppl are dear to God as much as to us. And unke saamne apni nahi chalti. Prayer chalti hai.
                                            All are doing - different faiths - but end we know and all waiting for climax in fear.
                                            I don't wanna die, save me - he is very weak can't tolerate my death.
                                            I will not u silent. 6 months I have been on ur bakbak..devoured my head. Say...Babumoshai.. in tape.

                                            Get out- My father's car- I will leave there- you will become Miss to Mrs and you Rahul to Late rahul.
                                                    anywhere no parking here- let's go.
                                            car went wrong- no car is smoking a ciggrette.
                                                    ye car nahi bekar hai.
                                                    e car ruuk jaa.
                                            you are like kaali billi- if u cross cat, cat gets bad luck.
                                            I don't have impossible in my dictionary- where purchased that bakwaas dictionary.
                                            do like him- my case is same as you
                                            capture few words from language- no I am not angelina jolie.
                                                    help me in name of angelina jolie
                                                    sunsaan sadak pe sunn ko gayaa- mere pass ek hi raasta tha- screaming out to her- mil gayee na- aa gayi na mushkil- I will protect u.
                                            go talk to them- get set po (south indian style)
                                            daal kaali nahi- kucch safed hai.
                                            doodh ka jalaa, burnol phook phoonk kar lagaata hai. This time didn't say yes.
                                            mere pass na aana- mujhe karate aate hain.
                                            you have copyright of running after marriage. haste haste lag gaye raste.
                                            tisari jhooth sahi nikali
                                            bina unke 50 saal niikalna- meaning I am 50 yrs- you are cheap joke.
                                            If I sleep with you, you won't be able to control yourself- no, I have a problem- that's what I said.
                                                    you will sleep on floor? I am ur show-her. No biz like show her.
                                                    I kick in sleep- Am I ur scooter? U are donkey's daughter.
                                                    Rahul teri to kismat khul gayi, kyun ki usse control nahi hoga.
                                                    Saree clad- Itna taiyyar hoke jogging par?
                                                    Don't underestimate power of a common man- Halwai.
                                                    300 steps- 100 mein to heaven comes.

                                            Should I say in words or write on sky.
                                            Keep good company. will they be able to trust? Actually mein bahut bura aadmi hoon.
                                                    ab tumhare havale meena saathiyo- do whatever u like marry-m, welcome-m
                                                    best way to escape problems is to face them.
                                                    biting hand in the way

                            <AWednesday>
                                I am minority in bollywood. If sth happens to you , we will catch him we assure. Par in movies nth happens to movies.
                                aaj sheher mein gaddhe nahi, gaddhe mein shahar hai.
                                prompt response - became angry but poora sheher hai gussa utarane ke liye.
                                Others tell you do - so suggested other names b4 he was put forward and he said no questions asked on what he would do.
                                lecturing and negotiation are different.
                                tough situ but if die, no worries I carry.
                                call panic situ a mock drill to evacuate for safety.
                                tumhai pichware par koi bomb rakhke gaya hai - barat mein aaye ho?
                                He is in tension but talking to wife as if it's normal.
                                Termination letter for 1 on duty.
                                Chief strategist stays in crowd - even his wife doesn't know his whereabouts.
                                Media covering it means they can be source of information 
                                In chasing, piggybacked a car and slapped him.
                                he is watching our panic thru your presentation - media is his eyes.
                                Can you do me a favor from media - sir, until i know the situ, i can't.
                                my wife also watching tv - plz don't put me into that.
                                india vs pak - ppl don't complain espn for the performance - so you or 7 else - yes or no?
                                we are doing our best - ain't good enough.
                                what is guarantee you will tell me exact locations of blasts - it's not an appliance ; you have no other option.
                                aaj kiski shakal dekhke uthe the subah - apni - tabhi.
                                It's not a pre-planned operation - it's extempore and come in evening to my place for drinks.
                                ye sab hoga - hey, I am drop out by choice. Definitely - outdated but a little time.
                                Latkana hi tha to mango ke ped se latkate they spared me - i gave same treatment to them after 3 years. so, i say to you kill them now.
                                        their faces are telling we are gonna be free.
                                        in next call i can trace him - he is good but not the best..
                                I will take 1 of the guys with me to make sure that we are told the location of bombs right - overriding orders - you are making mistake - i like doing so.
                                I am one who fears going to work and work seems like battle. I wanted to kill all 4 of them. the one who fears what name of dukan should be - it will be burnt in anger.
                                        Jhagda kisi ka bhi ho, marta mein hi hun.
                                        crowd you see - take a random face, I am that. I am stupid common man trying to clean his house of cockroaches.
                                        how this common man awoke with 6 kg of rdx - so should have lived on in suffocation?
                                        we are resilient by force not by choice.
                                        seeing all channels, feeling happy that we were not victims and start to adjust with the problems rather than solving them.
                                        you are capable of pest control but you are only giving them shelters. Why not nipping in the bud. 10 years to prove them guilty - it's a question on your ability.
                                        they asked this question we will kill, what can you do - asked this question on friday and then on tuesday, just replying it on wednesday.
                                        This add-salt-to-taste philosophy is wrong, not right way. Yes, but focussing on result not way.
                                        7 related died in blast - why, should I wait? Knew me thru a hello alone - showed me his engagement ring a day b4.
                                        So you are doing all this for those faces. I ain't sentimental or emotional - know loss.
                                        Unhe fakr hai haadson pe, mujhe fakr hai aison ko markar. I ain't a messiah, doing it for myself.
                                        I want children to move fearless anywhere.
                                        You are strange - normal man is expected to live, tolerate and die like normal.
                                        You see yourself b4 you know who I was - you were taking me seriously and fearful and now that I am normal, then confidence.
                                        What will you do now ? I will clear my ear first - it's difficult to hear.
                                        Common man ki thodi si hil gayi, ab wo rok hi nahi rahaa, thok bhi raha hai. Kafir hai, hamari kaum ko. We live for a purpose - you are laughing, in lap of death, the grip is les.
                                        abe bol ke to mara hota - we don't have time see media is here - so in encounter had to kill them.
                                        e1 agreed with common man - I think not looks like sketch - showed still searching instead of found place.

                                Love expression act in that direction - eat and then you feed me.
                                history book mein prem kahani bhi mili - found a pierced heart pic.
                                sahab itna dhyan rakhte hain ki mein bhool hi gaya ki wo unka naukar hai
                                Finger bowl ko galti se juice samajh kar pi jaate to.
                                I think of you as mentor and didn't want you to lose last race.
                                you lost intentionally- to win sth.
                                haar ke jeetne waale ko hi baazigar kehte hain.
                                dil ki divar pe tera naam - chahat ka jaadu kar diya tumne.
                                played good jua with the heart.
                                is it the age to go crazy for cars - not, it's for gals.
                                gimme icecream, no coconut water - goes to coconut shop asks for icecream
                                mujhe rasta nahi manjil chahiye
                                bujhdil karte hain and jeevan ki jang itni jaldi haar jayein
                                which gift husband gives to wife for first time - hey, that's naughty - i am talking pendant.
                                unchaiyon par le jaa raha hun.
                                the lover of her was plotter
                                did all to win the trust of father.
                                Today is a big day for me and i wanna start the celebration by working.
                                I have seen you somewhere - must have small place the world is
                                love you and hide also from you only
                                chupana bhi nahi aata - jatana bhi nahi ata.
                                is this chopra - or you think I am at telephone exchange.
                                to know the secret on phone - I am chopra speaking - daddy. Bolo beti.
                                don't talk anyone - khandan ki izzat ka saval hai. I will meet you - stay there and removed photo.
                                they dig goners for living these cops - i was happy for u
                                Burai milne mein nahi - secrecy mein hai
                                reason for my doubt is love
                                udane ki baat parinde karte hain - tute par nahi
                                I let you live race cuz my destination wasn't winning there but winning here.
                                you are invalid who has crutch but no hands.
                                i dislike his aggression more than denial.
                                visualizations he had created - newspapers ew, chopra crossed and sharma written there.
                                changing name doesn't change identity and crime.
                                the mercilessness one won't show even for a toy.
                                you have only seen his crown (taaj), aasteen ko nichod kar dekho - you see blood.
                                doctor told you for rest - one in trouble find even rest as trouble.
                                You have a prick of thorn, he has trishul in chest. his tears don't let it dry.
                                Feeling fortunate - it's unfortunate - i was meant to be this - hide me from world, the love I craved I got.
                                tired now , will sleep to heart's extent.
                                ========= Koyla movie starts
                                aadmi nahi aandhi hai
                                sabse vafadaar kutta hai.
                                ye tanpura nahi chalne wala - pehle hi generator par chal raha hai 
                                anpad but read his eyes
                                brahma ne beautiful banaya to why cover it - like you never saw - that's magic of brahma.
                                see bhagavaan model - one better than other
                                bhang - water outta cow and milk outta taps. Pandits doing bharatnatyam.
                                hase to haste hi jayenge. Chhori nahi gauri.
                                sadak par baithi ho - nahi sadak hamare neeche baithi hai.
                                what a piece - bhains - kamar nahi kamara.
                                akal kab aayegi - jaayegi to hi na aayegi.
                                gunga ban kar raaz jaan riya tha.
                                tune hamen bevkoof banaya - e1 in world is.
                                you speak from photo - can even touch you
                                baraat raaja la riya hai - khushiyan tu mana riya hai.
                                why blackening hair - heart is black - so doing matching.
                                sehra hataya buda nikla.
                                armaan ka sare diya jalaungi. you will kill me - i can't be yours in any life.
                                you brought flower better than her but couldn't smell that.

                                    saragarhi fort, gulistan fort
                                    Ranjheet singh 19th century - afghan evaded for sikh raj
                                    enemy's enemy is friend - so british took help of afghans
                                    regiment ke fauji
                                    India Afghan Border 1897
                                    That's an order Havaldar - Laaj rakhin Vahe Guru and runs anyway
                                            we don't mes with their probs
                                    beating with fatte - swords are kept for cutting nimbu?
                                    maarna hai maar le lekin pagg ko haath na lagana.
                                    if all don't follow orders, then no action can be taken.
                                    light reflection to send a message to far off fort.
                                    wasting water? my hisse ka paani I do anything with it.
                                    mein kisaan hoon, mitti se rishta to bana hi lunga.
                                    tujhme mujh mein feeti ka fark hai - post, rather than abhidyeya.
                                    runs till gets the shelter of other friends and running sides change.
                                    politics is not your field - don't tell me about my work.
                                            why I go there - nth happens there.
                                            disobey karke bach jaaoge. If were better, you won't be subjugated.
                                            rule was using indians as a lower layer and maintaining higher layer - autocratic rule
                                            need of change to democratic rule. Still higher layer exists and not every interaction with lower layer
                                                    we decide which higher layer ideology to accept. Debate on issues.
                                    small talks and real talks
                                            gore shadai hain - mitti se darpok - kile on our shoulder and hame darpok batate hain dangar - javab nahi diya?
                                                    realized we are not fauji but ghulam - are we here to salute!
                                                    Mughals, then British, when our comes. Want hukumat? no freedom.
                                            us ladki ne patti ki? behosh si! jaa pare - goli bhi khai svaad bhi nahi aaya.
                                            bye bye - hai rabba seedhe angreji. changa, chalda hein mein.
                                                    rab rakha.
                                    places hankie back and continue as upset.
                                            drinks his milk and then offers - no continue!!
                                    rooster fight famous in those days.
                                            fauj hai vaisakhi ka mela nahi.
                                            punishment - fight kushti. revolve around kila until they do.
                                            show bully face - cuz post permits you to do that - social support for mind's desires.
                                            regiment is made in name of sikhs - izzat connected to it.
                                            chot padegi to hi asli charitra will surface.
                                    sayani batein karta hai - you have nth else to think - bhainso ko chara dal - done, only your mother remaining.
                                            maar le. chal haath to lagega - tharki janani!
                                            kushti but singing 
                                                    whatever cocks say - they said pakak - so cooked them - they spoke angreji.
                                                    solution - you don't punish all - that's against your favor - you punish the outlier.
                                                    so it is important that you commant respect and it's not the position that elicits respect.
                                            if all don't follow - then punish their master. didn't sleep and let sleep.
                                            o has lei - I said won't laugh - kabhi to hasega (flow of narrative)
                                            underwear in between - so pulled it off with force.
                                            shoes. galti hamari hai gussa na kiya kar.
                                    o rabb da wasta - o itni udaas tarange na pesh kar. mere saath mana le suhag raat.
                                            gestures to sit. moves close. eyes turn. hands move (good direction)
                                    fought alone with british so that's why didn't win - without purdah, allah ki tauhin.
                                            britisher pay money to not attack their castles (must be lumpsum)
                                            sazzaa maaf - e1 come for meals.
                                            he said 2 weeks - we will finish punishment - losing power from him and gaining power.
                                            imagine someone bargaining at window for cinema.
                                            have seen life - know that these borders and war are all businesses.
                                            we won't make their masjid for century long rivalry. we won't do - give any punishment (didn't say leaving)
                                                    this is seva and seva is with desires (change the stance for retaining power - I am not forcing you - means I can)
                                                    can come with me but b4 deciding remember who inaugurated harmandir sahib.
                                                    jis pind nahi jaana naam kyun le - hazrat miya mir ji ne - guru teg bahadur requested.
                                            political benefit - you get pathans on your supporting side.
                                            you are late - but in time for this - else you would have been chatni sirji.
                                            Power games in e1 in material world - research, in martial, in business, in brute efforts. Bullying is just an expression of me in power.
                                            e1 have their bhookh - 7 badam, 7 izzat. khuda ne sabko equal - but based on birth you ate my mangoes - then pay for it lifetime.
                                    martial power game - hukum maanna - but you decide.
                                            laughing - asking us to run - we run away!!
                                            not only life but a lot at stake. Pyaar muhabbat insaaniyat ki baatein karne waala jung kaise ladega.
                                            don't make us weak - say in front you are afraid to see so many pathans together.
                                            I will fight but decide for what we are fighting - for money per month, dress, britishers - can you surrender eth for them.
                                            my life, my relations, my responsibilities more important than that.
                                            that what will you fight for sirji? long pause (shows you are in power) - no answer (also power)
                                            changes his dress to sipahi and kesari pagadi revealed what's to fight for.
                                    power struggles also effects whom you give power in future - so mess with me for a reason.
                                            the exact instruction was to stay in the castle - ghulam ko na to marji se jeene ka haq na marne ka.
                                            they chose it not on instruction - 21 freedom sikhs will fight today.
                                            feed water to others. goli se dushman khatam. paani se dushmani. bahadur sipahi - himmat hai ban ja.
                                    #power decided by birth in caste system. These are just excuses for getting power.
                                            telling lie to get them motivated and fight with full fervor.
                                    eating gaajar as you attack with the bullet.
                                            remember tank game in video game devices in childhood - like that fight. Inspired by real - abstracted and concreted for sth.
                                            people are things in wars - all run to castle - of 1K, some 10s will make it.
                                    game of cause and effect in fights - hit the zakhmi so that inferiorated people will stand and we will shoot them as well.
                                            using enemy as shield for protection - he didn't attack but could have.
                                            hamdardi na dikha - jaise gaane sunai hain, bachega to tu bhi nahi dangara.
                                            morcha sambhalo jang jaari hai - give motivation not anger - fight with wisdom.
                                            go and give all fight information to officials. and write names of the ones where they fought.
                                            fight is anyways in their favor - cuz (think billiards) - fewer targets and larger victims.
                                            casualties more bound to be there but they are bound to win also.
                                    white flags - governor coming till next morning - fight aggressively so that other forts are safe.
                                    you can't win - we won when we decided to fight and killing that chalta rahega.
                                    bahadur and mental is very less different - 21 vs 1K and talking about bravery?
                                            they think they can defeat in 12 hrs and pagadi under their feet - what do you think
                                            teri ta mein pissing at them - oye niche aja if they attack you will die naked and no1 will cover your rifle.
                                            desi rifles take out and enemy will run away embarassed (sharminda hoke bhaag jayega)
                                    khalsa flag at the center to give center of fight to e1.
                                    fort climbing thru makhan matki of janmashtami style.
                                            that's why stones on their heads. door is a weak link.
                                            all animals that chased by lion die cuz they don't attack back united. concerned with yourself.
                                            punjabis rock cuz they don't fear and take a stand.
                                            mounted telescope on gun and fired.
                                    maut fark mita deti hai - mujhe bhi barabar hone do.
                                    he takes out his pagadi for help - oye tu to buddha hai yaar - buddha hoga tera baap (while dying)
                                    brute force is powerful, fighter with strategy is more powerful, fighter with tools is even more, fighter with tools and strategy is far more.
                                            height an advantage in brute force.
                                    fighting and saying oye ek hasse waali baat bataun.
                                    mountain climbing to climb the fort. throwing the anchors away.
                                            they know after climbing they will die so they have to believe in some cause bigger than their lives (religion, etc)
                                    climbing along with bullets to stop them from being throwing away
                                    bombing the fort so that groups can enter inside easily.
                                    deevar tooti hai ham nahi - gotta stop them for long time.
                                            perhaps my last order - maan le.
                                    36 sikh koi shak
                                    message at time of dying - 100 lang fakar?
                                    but my shelter is you - to kya fort chhod ke bhag jaun.
                                    comm for community - hamari comm - with similar practices, values, beliefs, mindsets.
                                    vaheguru laaj rakhin.
                                    max people that can surround a person is limited so 1 person fighting with 100 means fighting with 10 in sets.
                                            but even there, once your attention is on a few of them - the remaining can finish off the game.
                                            it's not in sets - it in sequence - 1 goes then someone comes to replace him.
                                    child shield, cows shield, religious shield, women shield - these are old tactics.
                                    varnashram general expectation is that you will go heaven cuz of pious life - so spiritual upliftment is important but not center - material enjoyment is important.
                                    setting fire to kill - sharp object kill - but he won't shriek - that's the spirit.
                                            jo bole so nihal sat shri akal is all he yells as he embraces their leader.
                                            this spirit of fighting for the vision - reinforces the idea of oneness based on vision.
                                            after war or chaos - opportunity for stealing - the lower nature takes over.
                                    All 21 Sikh soldiers were awarded the indian order of merit - equivalent to the victoria cross, by the british govt.

                                    saw me cheating but didn't interfere and let me win - she loves me.

                                    who knows that salman khan also acted in the movie. salman khan at this minute.
                                    hit and run - nahi only hit - banda to yahi hai.
                                    TBI - Traumatic Brain Injury.

                                    sharabi says to police - eh police hands up!

                                    bebe nu davai patani kyun nahi dende.
                                    patiyan juraban - aajkal aahi chaldiyan ne.
                                    julus kaddeya hoya hai budiyan ne geet gaga ke.
                                    rolla na payin we like each other - menu pata hai dukh hoyega inna sona munda tere hathon nikal gaya par pen da soch.
                                            exchange kar layin pen naal - phas javange ; tu laike pajj ja - kamali lagadi hai par gallan sayaniyan ne.
                                    mool naalo vyaj pyara honda hai.
                                    pee ke kilo moot vekho kidda machari phirde ya.
                                            ve tu haddiyan tuda lenga - chalo bahut maar layiyan latiyan.
                                    o hi nagin nikali - mein darvaja maar thak gayi tun kaankhajure vangu side to nikal aya.
                                    aaja nahi taan bhoot banke teri doli vaali car de naal hi jaaun.
                                            tu apna maran da cha pellan pura karla.
                                    sidda kar chhad aayin kumanda na phiri bike nu.
                                            mein leke kaddu karna - kenda do khade ne - gear kadd la phuphad da.
                                    saddi izzat gayi - sari umar janani nahi judi tenu, chada tu hega kaadi izzat hai teri
                                            milala milani vaale kammal.
                                    aisa ki pyaar jo parivar di izzat hi rol daye - maar ke gitte sek dene si - maar cha vi palayi hondi.
                                    tu phasaya hai - le mein jammeya hai.
                                    mein twadde wall hain ; paven lamme paa paa ke kutto - keval munde da kasoor hai kudi da nahi.
                                    galti hoyi hai. Jedaan laike geya si Odaan hi khadi hai par ek gall samajh lo doven ek duje nu pasand karde yaan.
                                    te o rishta vi mein isse karke pejeya si ji - accha ji, mennu nahi si is gall da pata.
                                    odi galti nahi mein hi picche peya si - kadon khush lagda photo ca. kisse nu akh chak ke nahi vekheya. sache dilon pyar kita ji. Mint vaali gal hai. Kuch nahi chahida - na tv, na fridge, na cara - 3 kapadeyan ca kudi tor dyo - o tussi pyaar pyaar cha mennu kyun chutha pai jande ho.
                                    keh dyo cards te naa galat chap gaye si - kisenu keda pata lagda hai.
                                    kam mada kitta - kut maar karni hai, police ca dena hai jeve twadi marzi - nahi nahi theek hai.
                                    sayani vi te kitti hai vapis aake - na ande assi ki karde chitto chitari hoke kar vadade.
                                            javak hai jo manada de dyo paai - aive kedaan de dayiye - tadke baraat laike aayo.
                                            o tussi pooriyan talo shabash.
                                            o te mere khat si - mein aive hi garibani te paap kardi rahi - bebe mere naal rishta kara ke punn khat le.
                                    gandase naalo tikhi teri koni hai.
                                    assi seema nahi tapani - aa seema kaun hai - tu shanti hi rakh bebe.
                                    jede corner seetan te baithe ne - vya karalo.

                    Luka Chuppi
                            aawaz uthao par gala hi kharab hoga.
                            aapko controversy chahiye nahi milegi - as actor my life I live as I like you don't pay my bills.
                            if find his pic then will burn photo, and car - inkalaab zindabad.
                            didn't shake hand cuz muslim saying radhe radhe - responds valekum salam.
                            us nazar se dekhna paap hai - RK didn't marry.
                            taj mahal pyaar ki nishani not of marriage.
                            yahaan se badhiya dikh rahi hai - ammi na?
                            if known before marriage then would not have drunkard.
                            love marriage - people gush over perfumes and realize when perfume doesn't show.
                            love is important and marriage bond gives recognition and respect in society.
                            sleeps with phone on ear; dances western with saried girl.
                            jeevan mein gati; no your mati it's no traffic.
                            toilet caught red handed - where people do pet halka you did man halka.
                            in logon ki vajah se saala gaali ban chuki hai.
                            why not sit there - tv pe aate ho doctor ne kahaa hai kya.
                            tamasha nahi emotions hain meri.
                            I am an open book - even reading it takes time.
                            behave like wife husband - to ye harkat bhi to karte hi hain na.
                            hotel for honeymoon - every service available so what's point.
                            you staying without license of marriage so some more money for rent.
                            husband ho na ho but cable to hona hi chahiye.
                            abhi mood hua hai ..chay peene ka beta.
                            they are angry so mood is changed by expectation creation - you have come on auspicious day today is anniversary - so they are spoiling it if they take different stand.
                            akele akele maze nahi lene dunga, mujhe bhi chahiye.
                            trying to be extra nice - she says paagal kahi ka.
                            temper him - i said he will win marriage race now see what will happen.
                                    kunwara marega ye. iski zindagi to barbaad kar di na.
                            jinko kasht diya hai mili hai.
                            explore all possibilities - agar waise kar lete to kya hota - chappal nikal liya.
                            shadi bunnu ke saath - guddu.
                            badi ajeeb iccha thi.
                            dulha dulhan ho haso aise hehe karke.
                            vidai hai rovo - dulha also starts crying; per pado - bows to wife no to father.
                            why not happy - jaldi jaldi mein shadi so not habituated (explain it away)
                                    she doesn't know cooking.
                            as per her education degrees he should cook - yes at least good food e1 gets.
                            love me more than daughter and I have been cheating her - whole family agreed to live in. chupke se shadi - bechara.
                            chachi mein chota hoon, bewakoof nahi hoon.
                            luka chupi mein khel raha tha par pakde aap gaye ho - bribed with very costly cycle.
                            foolishness to come with sindoor already - dharma bhrashta - we were practicing at home.
                            ghee in fire - marrying again and the other not done. dadhi - have to hide face with such intents.
                            ghar pe le chalo - jo bezti ghar pe - ghar pe kootenge.
                            aap sudama hain, ham parashuram hain - next time she should be happy not like you.
                                    add extra sugar - rishte ki mithas bani rehni chahiye
                                    8 spoons in cup - ants will attack my mouth.
                                    age needs we know - same food you get suck so wanna taste different.
                                    need variety but need mind control - respect for one with mind control.
                                    think tharki kutta kamina they think.
                            family or mobile network - follows everywhere 
                            not keeping her smiling then problem - can't smile while speaking - like mad.
                            keeping arrangements at home and youtube mantras.
                            marrying at home - connected naala with shirt. data finished so please give wifi password.
                                    no wifi here - ok see you then.
                            not your work - other jethani throws utensils in sink.
                            men like money plant - need to show then direction where to go.
                            where going - temple - again? rashmi beta haath mat chhodna iska.
                            ravan - hat, shri ram - are following us.
                            he was marrying another woman - that temple - that's fine - no problem you have? where do we get such females?
                            ham to kaheen aur jaa rahe the - kahaan - US - I will spread khooni bavasir 
                            sehra pehnana so that never hide face.
                            goongi ladki se shaadi very lucky man you are, man.
                            muh boli behen hai - but gungi hai - ishare se bhaiya kehti hai - ho gayi tai tai fis - indicated rakhi
                            panditji dusre grah se na aaya..only different religion ...just do your work.
                            are roko wo fir se shadi kar raha hai.
                            wahaan mic pe jaake zoro se bolo - jay mata di.
                            mr guddu shukla stage par aaiye - he paid attention - it's he.
                            ye neech harkat hai ..he is already married, madam.
                            who marrying this time - abbas folds his hand ..muh boli behen.
                            itni marriage khandan mein na hui, jitni tu ek mahine mein kar raha.
                            apni biwi se dubara shadi kar raha tha.
                            it's not religion - mudda hai chunav ke liye - most youth in our country so they will give favor. they need roads, employment and free wifi.

                            ye koi time hai call karne ka - puchna chahiye kaise ho kya chal raha

                                    I think this stock was being manipulated.
                                    didn't get evidence for many suicides don't have proofs.
                            shakun hates his stocks falling and tears in eyes of daughters.
                            fraud was my business and greed was trade only so don't mix personal life.
                                    call me fraud - how do you get double price on stocks in 2 years when research on critical disease original target not yet achieved.
                                    they reached every doctor to push your drugs; trips incentive, cars for high figures, publicity, marketing; false demands created and so did value of your stocks - to hell with fair means.

                            will you tell me whom to meet or not - Yes - Rohit you are hurting me ; I need to revaluate my commitments with you.
                            sorry for the punch man - I was lucky I were you I would have killed that person. (role exchange)
                            we love each other - you should ask this question from yourself than each other.
                            decision has reasons - she has decision of marrying someone else has to have reason.

                            that went well - you came well as a naive idiot which are no threat.
                            problem is assigned and you will stop at nothing until you find an answer cuz that's what you are - so you don't have any choice but compelled to do this.
                                    a lunatic then, no, scientist.

                            robots used for cleaning debris of nuclear reactor - no man could.
                                    propaganda number of radiation so robot was never gonna work.
                                    alarm based bio-robots to clean up the graphite.
                            they eat chicken and then they eat each other.
                            Flaw in AZ-5 caused it. Operators pushed the button to the edge of its disaster - power rises before subsiding - boron coated by graphite which increases.
                            Baby absorbed radiation - to hell with deal and lives, 7 has to start telling truth and let country be humiliated if it must.
                                    all of those sacrifices of people what about them.
                            does anything change no but you get dehumanize killing other men.
                            State must protect its secrets especially the ones of nuclear - it was USSR pride but here it became humiliation.
                                    the bug was known - that power increases for a while but classified information not told to escape humiliation.
                            you went to doctor yesterday how's your health - you don't know.
                            rewards, it's not yours yet first testimony - just tell operator error which it was. Let's have hero, villains, truth, then deal with reactors.
                            I am brutally stubborn which you are hoping for. They will never fix the reactors cuz admitting the probs means they lied. They must be forced.
                                    it's a show trial - jury have handed their veredict (being bought)
                                    fired for knowing the facts.
                            I have also willingly given my life by going to open reactor - is it not enough - sorry, but it is not. You have to stop it from happening again.
                            science is good but the test is as good as the men carrying it out.
                            Running low power and 10 hour delay - competent management would have insisted on cancelling the test - allowed it to proceed.
                                    people suddenly told they must - refer last year manual some things crossed down instructions.
                                    Bully commands to them - follow the instruction in the file thrown at him. All instincts against you but 1 in power in strong.
                                    not trained, not warned about it happening. Human problem created by delay. Experience of 4 months.
                            reactivity goes up and down - operators just maintain balance and don't need to be nuclear physicists.
                            Mindless manager - you are procrastinating. Other people would have done it already. You are doing fine - keep doing.
                            Fear induced that you won't get job anywhere if you don't increase the power to 700 - it isn't safe - we close the reactor for 24 hrs and start from there.
                                    I want your command to be recorded - hit hard down - that is itself suspicious (of course, in name of oh...rules...) but dare do right thing.
                            you are witness not prosecutor I will ask questions.
                            dead jews and poles but not them - no1 thinks it is gonna happen to them.
                            putting in change and it wasn't serious I believed them you know why - cuz you were in charge.
                            any scientist could replace me but you did eth we asked for and eth needed so you really mattered. Men, material, lunar rovers.
                                    they heard me but listened to you.
                            minister and deputies - entire congregation of obedient fools.
                            Xenon build up so power kept going down to 0 when asked for shut down. Reactor isn't hot enough so it won't rise at all so 24 hrs to slowly rise it.
                            But Dyatlov wants it done now - Boron rods moved out and still power doesn't budge.
                                    control rods are the breaks on this car.
                            Ruined and nothing was gonna work but all Dyatlov wanted was to complete the tests for power gain.
                            Cuz of insufficient control rods skala system is recommending the reactor be shut down.
                                    well of course, it is saying that it doesn't know we are running the test - confident fools are the most dangerous of all.
                            pulling slingshot harder than anyone ever - they start the tests.
                                    water removed - 1 sec uranium is in its full blow.
                                    "Manager" what did you do - the techs getting the blame for carrying out shitty commands.
                                    In every control room there is 1 button AZ-5 for instant shutdown.
                            stop it at that - adjourned, let him finish 
                                    Dyatlov was confident fool but he did that assuming failsafe switch off of AZ-5 but in circumstances he created there wasn't.
                                    shutdown system had fatal flaw - AZ-5 move boron rods into reactor very fast boron made but graphite covering which lead power surge before fall.
                                    Graphite increases reactivity. Why - same reason we don't have containment around them, properly enriched fuel in cores.
                                            positive void reactors cuz they are cheaper.
                                    reaction in core skyrockets. Every last molecule instantly converts to steam which expands and ruptures fuels and control rods can go no further.
                                    graphite rods fixed in position go on accelerating the reaction. This makes Chernobyl nuclear reactor a nuclear bomb.
                                    3 sec before 1 person sees the impossible 350 kg steel lid on reactor jumping up and down.
                                    In very short time, reactor designed to operate at 3200, reaches the power of 33000.
                                    Pressue can't be contained, explosion. Oxygen rushes in to react with hydrogen and superhot Graphite. Chain of disaster is complete.
                                    No1 in room knew that shutdown button could act as detonator. Because it was kept from them.
                                    You contradict your Vienna statement - I lied, many others did following orders - from KGB, from central committee.
                                            and there are 16 nuclear reactors in USSR with same fatal flaw.
                                    If Soviet State is responsible you suggest then you are treading on dangerous grounds. we are on dangerous grounds cuz of lies.
                                    Every lie incurs debt to truth which is paid sooner or later.
                                    That's how reactor core explodes - lies!
                            Gets an arrest for telling truth in that world.
                            You had glorious history of communism but you are not brave, heroic but just a dying man who forgot himself.
                                    On just world I would be shot for my lies but not for this - speaking truth. Scientists and their obsession with reasons - when bullet hits your head, will it matter why.
                                    whole world saw you Vienna, it will be embarassment to kill you now. Your testimony won't disseminated in press and not accepted by state - it never happened.
                                    You will live not as scientist anymore, no friends, other men will receive credit for your work.
                                    What if I refuse (rollback) - why worry about sth that ain't gonna happen - so perfect it should be put on money.
                                    Scientists are naive. We fail to consider how few actually want us to find it. Cost of truth - now I ask cost of lies.
                                    Suicide aftermath, they acknowledged the flaw in nuclear reactors. Retrofitted from happening again.
                                    Those who spoke against the veredit were arrested, denunciation, imprisonment.

                                    some would curse and spit floor - their own floor, that makes no sense - mostly they were looking for bucks no matter what they found. It's better to be polite and call your lawyers.

                                    cuz you are small part of it. body combination of elements remains - decomposed to plants, herbivores, carnivores - cycle of life goes on.
                                    world is all and I am one. cycle of life goes 1 direction even alchemy can't change that.

                                    can you marry me? when you got this idea- today 8:45
                            You smoke- no, no- I like those- Not that never; new years dam lagaaya hai
                                    alcohol- good for heart, skin and vodka- you see; I don't like such girls
                                    Problem is I have yes to another boy- oh- no, how long it takes to say no from yes; not with you, please.
                                    bitalian Sir salute- He also responds that occurs to him he is not in army grounds
                                    he is practising alone then girl comes says hello- he greets as side hello then occurs that she is the girl.
                                    eyes gestures- mast hai na? he also.. goes
                                    12:30 I will leave- punctuality you see.
                                    bach gaye bhaiyya- ye tarika tha baat karne ka- no madam, you are marrying my senior. But we love each other, right- oh, let's break up.
                                    he is better than me in running, jumping- hey, I look like doing military selection? I didn't like. Like with me, eventually you will.
                                    After all, who will marry him in this age- so I be scapegoat- phone is ringing- yours!!- oh!
                                    After marriage, "confined forever"- yaar, umra kaid ho gayee.
                                    following guy with conference call of e1.
                                    Saved her number as madam- "Come to cafe"- if sir knows then problem- he only called.
                                    oh great sir chose another girl for himself- no, he has selected for you- already tension, now he open marriage beaurow- how can you say such things about hubby
                                    You exchange your contact numbers- biology to milna chahiye- nahi chemistry- are subject to science ke hi hain na.
                                    sleeping cells- govt grudges and help- that's why not US attack after 9/11
                                    finish the lead to keep sleeper cells constantly waiting thru life.
                                    Why laughing- matter se chutkara mila- why you- that matter rejected you
                                    I know it's difficult to forget me- so handsome I am- what?- nahi maskari mein bola.
                                    1st date gotta give all that boyfriend asks- no, no already you have arranged big party so much expenditure; that's ok. No I am thinking if you ask kiss, I won't be able to say No.
                                    I want kiss- But I don't know- just close your eyes; I will take care.
                                    Which batch you were in- kashmir- which year 2005- he was in delhi that time- show me your cards; you allow anyone- I have smart people.
                                    Circle means target to reach exact ppl who killed his men.
                                    Why used me- little late and above- yes, risk ka theka police ka hi to hai- baaki remote par comment pass karte hain.
                                    She tries to scare him- sorry, finger cutter..ab..nail cutter. why you came here.
                                    I heard deep kiss burns 30 calories=30 mins of speed walking- seedha bolo kiss karna hai..forwarded message, vaastu, astro kyun laana.
                                            this position ain't right- ab kya vaastu dekhke kiss karoge.
                                            where you going- hiding in almirah- no, this almirah is busy.
                                            News dekhi kya- oh this came in news- here are cctv cameras in frightened state.
                                            Jagga you don't keep books,clothes in almirah like other people.
                                            People cry for sleeper cells thinking that they are normal ppl cuz they do live normal lives.
                                            show him power of sleeper cells and he will show up.
                                            He has called me alive- leader will die making sleeper cells into coma cells.
                                            Think about your family- In Taj attack, these ppl who lost legs they don't have family. Army man can't get better opportunity.
                                            Engagement next time then marraige not now- Ek baar bataa diya samajh mein nahi aaya
                                            Even main person killing should be delegated.
                                            planned blast- give a delusion of he hitting from his hand.
                                            Got it? You better die in suspense- shots him dead.

                                                    ghar ki khtirdaari aurte karti hain- damadji mein ladki ki maa hoon- haath peeche kar, zyada character mein na ghus.
                                                    beti ke baare mein batao- hasti hai to basant aati hai- smile kare to barish ho jaati hai- tu mausam ka haal bataa rahaa hai.
                                                    kitni bhashaiyen aati hain- nahi pataa- slaps, kaise baap hai saale- kaise pataa hoga aaj hi to kidnap kiya.
                                                    beti khoobsurat hai, shaadi fix- chacha len den baatein kar lo- mein nahi dene wala- aap chup raho ji itna accha damad hai.
                                                    time ho gayaa ab ham ijazat lete hain- bina shadi ke mein beti wida kaise karun- haath pakad liya chalo ab vida karta hoon.
                                                            vidai ho rahi hai- rovoge nahi.
                                                            lesson learnt today- ladki ko kidnap karo to bhi dahej dena padta hai.
                                    hug to dete jao- nahi baad mein
                                            meri haddi to durghatna ghati
                                            you take shelter of gundas but he deals with 50 himself- so he is real male.
                                            girl accident- helping her was taken as line maarna but do right thing anyway.
                                            tumhara naam jaanu hai na- I saw in flashback- eat sambhar- she thinks that sambhar can cure cancer- if she eats, then will be 0 figure like me.
                                            pregnant- ye matka maine diya hai- bahut mehnat ki hai.
                                            ghumne ke liye ooty, relax ke liye beauty
                                            no matter how manymovies on TV but cinema ka mazaa apna hai- home theatre vs multiplex- patni like puja no mazaa; girlfriend like resort. mood fresh and soch creative ho jaata hai.
                                            how you manage home- I was thinking about you in office- boss ki daant khakar 1/2 day leave li hai- mere huzoor aapko paakar mere dil ko guroor aa gayaa- lattoo ho jayegi- you will get your favorite pakvan- karele ka halwa zarur khana.
                                            har dish se mein thoda thoda leta hoon- padma tumhare cooking mein magic ka jaadu hai.
                                            no child- I said let's do check up- she said she is fit- I do check up- shakal se sharif dikhte ho par janvar ho
                                            alcohol dekhke judge na karo peeke karo- padma saamne khadi- she heard it all. then got beaten.
                                            tumse bahut seekhna hai beta- mein itna bhi mahaan nahi hoon.
                                            tere sab log maar kha chuke hain tu hi reh gayaa hai- you can't touch me I am dangerous brand- brand this is made in japan toota ke nahi, china toota.
                                            dam hona chahiye jo mujhme koot koot ke bharaa hai.
                                            dikhne mein stylish hoon par usse tune dhoka khaya to pachtayega. aag se khelega to jal jayega.
                                    ise nark mein bhi jagah nahi milegi- kya 10-12 saal kanun pe waste karne.
                                            dekho mat pyaaar ho jaayega.
                                            haathi paagal ho jaaye to use maar dena chahiye.
                                            kya maara unhone gundon ko- pura paisa wasool ho gayaa. brand ko jeb mein rakhte hain.
                                            kisme kaam karna hai- brand ko jeb mein rakhte hain. gunde came in middle like ads in tv serials.
                                            agar police ko tera pataa chal gaya to tera rashan jail mein- kya game khela hai, wah! tarif karna band karo.

                            on a phone, telling a girl- agar ladki sharab piye to sehat to bigdegi na.
                                    meri cigrette to nahi pee- lipstick ka nishan nahi hai.
                                    had been a boy, uske daaru ke paise bhi mujh pe- now I get boh daaru and compnay- paisa wasool.

                                    thru those places he sees the old time - self with his friend.
                                    RDX in his truck said 7 who loved him most.
                                    if he is a terrorist then tell me also - I don't wanna write about him 
                                    travelled so much not for nothing. And I spend 12 years for nothing.
                            khata khulvane ke liye courage - I have many accounts.
                            according to scriptures, cloth must be worn as per time - so nighty.
                                    I put her in nighty - bring her out.
                                    drink less else account closes b4 opening.

                            boring museums but at least they don't tell lies.
                            you valued media news more than his statements.
                            business of media and public likes truth or spice. Question marks do that.
                            make your newspaper 8 pages instead of 24 to avoid manufacturing.
                            problem with our reporting then go courts. You have James Bond - license to kill - so can't mess with you.
                                    as per sources it has been alleged.

                            Dubai you went - out of fear I went - not fearful of us?
                            Try to understand if I come then sanju gangster involvement if don't then killed cuz of refusal but pride in 2nd in family's eyes.
                                    please consider.
                            sunrise sunset what difference - good work then good writings by press.
                            movies - bewda badshah, mawali maksood, munna mbbs, raja tapori.
                                    looking for family movie - read? then story - bakwaas - horror movie.

                            if i could rewind i would go tell him - rewind thru movie.
                                    never got to say thank you - every word smaller than what he did for me.
                                    jung he fought and alive cuz of him. shabd nahi mile.
                                    you deserved a better son - who would support not burden.
                                    but I bet he would not love as much as this nalayak son did. you are sahas swabhiman, jan.

                            equivalent exchange - but world isn't perfect. But in principle, every perseverence pays off - it's more like a promise.

                            heat water so fast that it acts as bomb - human body is 70% water.
                            running away from him - armstrong will set it right - he is all yours while running.
                            We are going after him - I am not done; not even close.
                            why don't you get it; I am trying to save this country by destroying central.
                            no man in armor ; so soul bounded to body ; it all makes sense - you committed the only taboo - you know there are some lines you should not cross.
                            I came out to see if I could lend a hand and I got him ; if nothing else it would be an exciting story for my son.
                            Next time superior asks you to take credit just try it for once.
                            Damn book they tell eth but where to find them.
                            else you will stay short you subatomic shrimp.
                            you treat me properly else complaint for no dinner.
                            next time you would have made bregadier - easy for you to say.
                            how those elric bros doing - I am their commander not father.
                            you take bros away - that decision would be there - in exchange of dog of military chance to do research material confidential ones.
                            I never boys so defeated - that's what you saw ; I saw fire ; they will come - ability to bind soul to armor at that young age ; it took deep understanding.
                            act like a girl not gearhead ; throwing wrench.
                            you do have nerves of steel young man but have a lot to learn - when did he wield his sword.
                            what do you think - nothing to think ; it is alchemy
                            can't say I am interested ; not really religious type - to know god is know hope 
                            arrogance to play God claim.
                            do we look like stage performers - yes - let's leave.
                            still trying to sell that line.
                            me and god don't go well together; even if we went he would probably send me back here.
                            answer my questions and I will be on my way or I can involve military.
                            you will have to pay price for this - sorry not today.
                            Without hope what am I left to live for - you have to figure that out yourself.
                                    get up use legs to make your own path.
                            you have picked wrong target.
                            no response to question - good focus on book.
                            to keep state certification I need to pass assessment annual.
                                    made into military weapons after passing.
                                    fabricating story that poverty made her go away.
                                    human progress is important step a scientist should understand - what are you upset about.
                                    opportunity in front of us but broke the rules so we are the same.
                                    like in military, we take life when ordered so as far interfering with lives he is not very far.
                                    we choose our own path knowing too well what we are doing, right fullmetal. will you break everytime you face this - we are getting our bodies back.
                                    we are not gods only humans as they continue walking - same theme in previous fake godman taking that role.
                                    can't separated from chimera body; you passing will be peaceful. God, I have sent 2 people back to you, please accept them in your loving arms.
                    Movie - Political Discussions 
                            Cuddle Therapy. Dance Therapy. 
                            B4 rome banishes me, I banish rome.
                            trouble maker for a section - but not whole country i am inspiration.
                            I don't run in rat race - oh, you have left the race for rats.
                            sach bolne ki hammat hai - I respect myself. I don't think I am respectable - kisi ka respect won't touch heart.
                            confusing that PM is nice - confusing - but that's life is ...it is not straight forward.
                            itna soch ke jiyunga to life nahi ji sakta.
                            my opinions about him has changed - life means that opinions change.
                            better to start from left - for 2019, Kamal Hassan sits on right today - she has direction right and I got ideology right.
                                    I am on the right but not audiences' right anyway
                            sincere in expression but expression is a debate.
                            hardcore stats is what we need not emotion. when has govt ever talked about 4th general industrialization.
                                    fulcrum of our growth - recognize challenges but committed to find solutions and not shrug responsibility.
                                    test my patriotism on random instances. surging india - but not cool to be patriotic.
                                    national anthem goosebumps but in proper place. 
                                    Iffy audio stopped - sang anthem stopped. Not apologetic - soldier at border doesn't seek my validation for national anthem.
                            he said to the hindu - newspaper - don't be suspicious about me everytime.
                            not talking religion in politics is a bit naive. state can function while divorced from religious beliefs - secularism doesn't mean absence of religion but permit all.
                                    Supreme Court - yato dharma tato jaya - our ancient not secular enough.
                                    under 1 constitution and 1 flag - irrespective of variations - you enjoy equal rights.
                                    celebrate diversity but with unity - why classify - hindu nation by population we are elder brother - surging india electricity comes to every home.
                                    facts to make a claim that it's hindu party 
                                    double standard - why pin drop silence on when convict of 84. justice prevails.
                                    Prez who happened to be muslim but pursued excellence for cause of nation - talk for whole party - don't need tutions and permission lips.
                                    hindu terror - incorrect and gross stereotyping, oversimplification. you have to support it with facts.
                                    teevra - extremist not terrorism - will you use the same nomenclature for other religion - when last you saw this column - terrorism has no religion
                                    hindu terrorism but janeudhari - beauty of ethos 
                                    breaking india - not in sovernity, integrity - teevra vaadam or stronger words.
                                            break country words will eventually indulge in terrorism.
                                    in spite to disagreements, but india dream together.
                                    e1 has spoken against cow vigilantism - good language but ground reality remains.
                                            corrective action has taken - action has been taken. No obstruction of justice.
                                    politics has lot to symbolism - garlands the convict - sacked the ministers for garlanding.
                                    justice starts with prosecution. lot of injustice done to law makers, etc.
                                    not subservient, can't brush aside unequivocal stand - but is his stand on who take lives.
                                    1 person who gave accusation in parliament and available to public scrutiny - insinuating that entire party or machinery is subservient to that is not fair.
                                            leader of party and govt has made his stand clear.
                                            break the law and not be spared - to mock that is again an insinuation.
                                    not numbers for power - old fashioned - common purpose and beliefs not opportunist.
                                    maoist terrorism - many supports - confront them - discontent in a way that I don't like - very forgiving expression - have a dialogue.
                                            what is revolutionary in killing people.
                                            no dialogue with gun to the head.
                                    terminate them or spoken to - dialogue when war is raging - dialogue can't be in fear or threat - with nation on its knees.
                                    get priorities right - human life matters, cow slaughter matters.
                                    law and order can't go without development - gotta go together. development will fall prey to law and order.
                                    so when talking about development - we include law and order - holy cow! british expression - can you sense of freedom as he says this and I don't lynch him verbally.
                                    investigation and enquiry - met victims - no law order in hand vs last.
                                    with you give opportunity with hyphen or comma in this.
                                    Kamal Hassan why are you holding back - what would to like to come and punch me.
                            sting operation on the person
                                    foreign money via NGO in name of political party to route it to NGO - funding for NGO stopped by govt.
                                    eth is organic or provoked separately.
                                    be aware - attack communities - curriculum designed for madrasas basic was differ between hindus and muslims.
                                    these forces not just protests - as indians we need to prioritize at what cost I want political victory.
                                    opportunism can eat up anything - secularism or not - nation first is my ideology.
                                    showing dream vs realising it 
                                    equality can't be subservient to secularism.
                                            married to parsi - don't go to court - barge into parsi temple - respect the tenets of religion and the way they practice it.
                                            men also have restriction to duty and way of life b4 entering.
                                    enter into fire temple anytime I wish - tell a community that tenets of your religion are subservient to my wish.
                                            constitution is supreme - devil of change but not god.
                                            dalits were not allowed in temple - that time not allowed but season of change
                                            aitreya rishi - written brahmanchanda puran - dalit caste community.
                                    1 won't permit - 1 religion, 1 language, 1 attitude and 1 education approach.
                                            legends should go to school - cultural language also goes to school.
                                    don't know about tiruvalluvar - we have failed as nation.
                                    Irani so thoroughly searched and keep explaining we are parsi.
                                    India for hindus in New York - he speaks for himself and he speak in NY.
                                            why? why presume man on street in NY speaks for me - does he have BJP badge on him.
                                            presumption that sth sw says that you can't concur it has be from BJP
                                    if 7 would praise Prez after 9/11 - can't establish correlation with them.
                                    you had me at hello - he had me at kamal.
                            T-shirt big boys play at night - for night cricket promotion and lots of harkat not on t-shirt but your imagination is going too ahead.
                                    shadi ka phase which i want to talk about.
                                    named as meter - he runs on money
                                    ilzam from colleague takleef but gotta accept what is.
                                    he has fallen below animal st. said in quran.
                                    cricketers ne hospitality dikha di ki jita diya.
                                    nafrat se votes aasani se milte hain - pyaar se nahi but kashmir needs solution ppl agree
                            so what say? siyasat nahi karni chahiye thi ya shaadi nahi karni chahiye thi.
                                    junoon ek khwaab - she married to junooni. so she accepts that.
                                    kya ho sakta tha vs kya hua
                    Movie - Ghazi Attack
                            Sea sickness when new joinee - money but difficult life - so with all jobs!
                            Sailor hai ya liftman.
                            Ghazi attack movie, paramanu, etc
                    Movie - Neerja
                            2 things - tolerate, secondly don't just tolerate. bataa bahadur kaun.
                                    having fun with it - are you married - tell if my hindi was good says englishman. robot dance.
                                    1 word call to cockpit saying hijack and they run away - terrorists are helpless.
                            all passengers together can easily empower a bunch of shitheads with the guns with more casualties on passengers side - but who takes that risk for overall freedom.
                                    like they did for national freedom.
                            they don't know language so easy to add more words - there is no pilot so don't worry but gotta cooperate.
                            worried so many pak people on plane - as if I can say sorry to other countries (it's not that nation is shit but the ideologies are)
                            is there any radio engr in flight - gesticulating the person pretending he is that he should not stand.
                            exploitation as wife earlier vs from terrorist now.
                            kills 1 person who is most troublemaker (needed toilet call) - the relatives if love is pretty high can spark the seed of rebellion in the microrealm and you will get some supporters who can cross the threshold of their courage.
                            let me serve water (first offering to them only - thug life in microrealm) - no water - sir, I am doing my duty like you are doing yours (taking no shit from nobody)
                                    eating airline food and some packages before hijack.
                                    why not kill her - she is only functional and will be helpful later on if plan succeeds (so most enthu rebels are first targets to discipline other sheeps)
                                    announced no american passports (those rascals will be first to die) - can't say the word america but has to convey that americans make some excuse and not give - some advantage from chaos. Also informed fellow air hostess.
                                            counting can be unfavorable. but not getting american will definitely attract air hostess getting shot.
                                            some cooperation will help but when you know it means getting shot cooperation is a bitch.
                                            when they are calling names for shots, don't be the obedient guy of the class - they have taken your identity of passport from you - nth to uniquely id you.
                                            what's morality that you saved US fella but killed UK guy who was not their target!!
                                    her courage is what they are proud of and also afraid of.
                                    the guy who can help is treated like animal to be slaughtered (do you association between slaughter tendency and the way you treat people)
                                    sing a song - no fear of death cuz it's already here - but threatened children then mere sapno ki raani kab aayegi tu.
                                    you can be hero in the microrealm but that's what you are as a person outside of knowledge of microrealm and get the ecstacy of life.
                                    they pick a fight on disagreement - that's a potential opportunity for some situ.
                                    some discipline is necessary at killing - if you kill for slightest provocations and don't keep fallbacks of beating someone, slapping, anger in voice, etc - passengers will revolt cuz high cost function would break the threshold of their courage.
                                    setback of previous microrealm of failed marriage cuz of high demanding husband - gave inspiration for this microrealm.
                                            I want to give food to all - asking terrorist ain't you hungry. she was like mother of the plane not letting them die.

                                    beauty has not tantar mantar to nahi.

                                            another problem can't ask direct questions. cuz letting suspicion exist. full planning - kamarbandh stolen.

                                    anyone else when he said that to stay alive we have to keep this as secret but when I see her eyes I see your ramayan is fake.

                                    1 joke I tell - this is another joke. Once a man got married - then.. - joke over.
                                    suspicion - they leave eth to come empty hand to home and still suspicion.
                                    if don't get proof then won't let him feel your emptiness.
                                    lassi se makkhan nikal degi. abhi to shadi bhi nahi hui.

                                            now eth is open - how long keeping his bed warm. laughting and crying together. where I fell short.
                                    when in illusion, eth starts supporting that argument.
                                    uska bhi rada hai kisi ke saath. My truth and lie has no difference anymore so shoot me - freedom from body but soul neither yours get free nor mine.
                                            (giving him ideas what not to do)
                                    can't live with himself so kills himself while firangi lives. The Paschattap is unbearable for him. 
                                            you thought so low of me - But satisfaction of telling him how low he thinks of himself now.
                                    movie is overall disaster where no1 gets happy cuz of manipulating truths.

                            talent - you have read and write; I have breaking. Strength source - prem. Now with mountain.
                            Why not start newspaper - is it easy - is it difficult than breaking mountain.
                            drought - e1 left - he gave money but stayed.
                                    to him it is worth dying for - mountain hole gave water and he called mountain friend.
                                    snake bite - cuts his thumb off - obviously mountains will have lots of snakes.

                    Movie - Mrs Serial Killer
                            Police come at decent time.
                            when staying close to problem doesn't solve it - then go far and look at it.
                            I can help those who are rich. But I can help when I know truth. He is innocent how so sure - cuz ....my ex-bf.
                            We have to prove that serial killer is outside - if not him, 7 else has to do it.
                            felt like wall compressing.
                            attempt to murder tha - 
                            why don't you make tattoos - tajmahal pe graffiti achi nahi lagti.
                            you want time to marry but dating; were you using me - you are not a candle jo use karke khatam ho jayegi.
                            Thanks I owe you you saved my life - don't worry about it ; will it take back when needed.
                            chloroform exchanged and won't work cuz no1 tries it himself.
                            inference continuously - so you are gay cuz lady perfume; Bites and knows that it's a lady. Sorry I am hungry won't do it again.
                            if she escapes and declares who killer is - but most criminals get caught when trying to improve things.
                            her problem was detection of perfume - her smartness was her problem
                            lavaris body from college for experimentation - make up and catering skills kaam aaye.
                            what to do this girl - she has seen me.
                            they made lynch outside of that.
                            Lynching a lot in movie. Idealogy - god used for supporting ideas - teen pregnancy - abortion or molest later.
                            well with joy - call me mrityu not joy - I am not icecream.
                            Who are you - Sir - 50% is Sir. Who are you.
                            you were just taking revenge - laughing; remembered a joke - if laughing in such situation, must be really good - comedy bol ke romance movie dikha raha hai; not fair haan.
                            thriller; I am losing patience; comedy kahaan hai.
                            tragedy; comedy chhod ke sab kuchh diya isne; comedy kahaan hai.
                            got transfer to get you but she started hating so joke. You didn't get proof against me; more funny.

                            how they took advantages of exceptions in the system that they were aware of and presence of mind like their working hours and all.
                            Thanks we are alive - well cuz they still don't have got money. Not threatened by money vs life cuz it's not 2 exclusive options, really.
                            Surrender with publicizing - exposing others and surrendering only 9 lakhs to 50 lakhs - they wondering where extra money came from - real loot was 16 crores but bank can't say that and thieves can take advantage of this.
                            Threatened to be killed - another policeman lured into killing the MLA for ransom much more than what he would get otherwise.
                    Movie - Paatal Lok - was going to kill him but heard the joke before doing that.

                            making of the criminal outta person - suppression or bullying by street boys - he wanted revenge given opportunity. Of course training himself to adapt to situation. But in politics there's backing for a person that gives them confidence that they won't be killed if they do then revenge. Thana separation of crimes.
                            Punjabi 10th exam for banking compulsory. Regionalism on rise so govt under pressure but already there. Govt system means state schools and central schools - then private schools will rise if it doesn't work.

                            Least popular theory - truth. No strong suspicion - state sponsored lie. Poison suspicion arrests so should we not have.
                            foreign secretary - plz give statements and said several times.
                            without toxicological study you can't tell for certain that there were no poison.
                            no right for postmorten for a relative. KGB removed poison thru cuts.
                            India colonized again after him which wasn't possible if he was alive. socialism word added.
                            all arrested in emergency.

                            Security of country sold is nationalism - all on KGB payroll in that times.
                            we won't look in that direction even when they point in that direction cuz of prejudices.
                            Find truth as shraddhanjali to Lal Bahadur Shastri - that's nationalism.
                            What you got - mudda for next election - Rajneeti mein jeetna zaruri hai cuz losers can't change India's destiny.

                            honor to die by your side - honor to live by yours.
                            his only wish - remember us.

                            picking the pieces. Picking diamonds in island if only rescued.
                            put your silver tongue to use - i talk to my wife.
                            you wanna be a champion. People don't want champions they just want their cheeseburger and play games and watch tv.
                            i think you wanna believe them cuz you are quitting. You want me to say you are right and we should go live in log cabin.
                            You can't be this naive to say he is evil not every day normal man with some problems.

                            I am trying to figure something out here - when a person is completely insane like you, do they know they are insane?
                            comfortable for you to label me insane but I didn't choose but chosen - whatever!
                            e1 knows these sins - people mock them and can't keep straight face talking about them - tolerate but you should thank me - yeah! delusions of gradeur.
                            You are not messiah but movie of the week or a t-shirt at best.
                            You were doing god's good work - god works in mysterious ways.
                            World is a fine place and worth fighting for - I agree with the second part.

                            expectation of divine reward - put a coin in wishing well than buy dinner.
                            giving a narrative - transference of fear and self-loathing - catharsis.
                            rewrites brain pathways - critical thinking is stunned - think KC!!
                            yearning for things will be different - fulfilled in with friends, love for the rest of life.
                            great preaching - seek no titles no retribution
                            what happened - murdered and made a big show of it.
                            ontological fallacy of expecting light at the end of the tunnel - that's what preacher sells.

                            you have tendency toward myopia - tunnel vision, blows investigation - vision skews, twists evidence.

                            you know what I mean and you won't say it, that's it. I am trying to be your good friend, Marty (marriage relp already)
                            you were smarter before - sorry for not being here and taking it all for granted.
                            I feel like coyote that if I walk past cliff and don't look down - I will be fine.
                            you are not bad - you have got fishhooks in your heart and soul
                            see in eyes and you know or in behavior exhibited - everybody wears their hunger and their haunt you know 
                            their sensory experience made constituted a unique individual with purpose and meaning.
                                    once strings are cut all falls down.
                            so you gonna go home with this guy - none of your business, do you fk ur wife.
                            Rust needed boundaries (or rules) - they are good.
                            There's comfort there; give it a chance ; why don't give things chances - we know what we want and don't mind being alone.
                            man can't love; at the least the way he means; inadquencies of reality show in.
                            world needs bad men to keep other bad men from the door.
                            all experiences of life - we hold on so tight but all the same as a dream locked up in small room called brain.
                                    REL those experiences that drove rascals to commit crime but larger picture what they had become.
                            detective's curse - solution right under the nose but paying attention to the wrong clues.
                            bad treatment and she tells his wife about what he used to do with her and it's over.
                            oh! It's about him should have told - with gun cocked at you.
                        betrayal's not removed by its interruption. I've been a mess. don't give a damn about your feelings.
                        i am police but are u in that capacity now as law enforcement. I love you honey and I ain't giving up on you.
                        If I could get another shot. Can I tell u sth? - yes - it is none of my business; I don't wanna hear about it.
                        Kartel's suffering so as far suffering goes bullet on head isn't high.
                        Marty's behavior is expression of his pain and weakness and not about you - duck under rationalization; you must be great husband - leave without saying.
                        why you are so hot to see the file - why are you so hot to not show the file to me.
                        many anti-intruder devices they installed like thread being crossed.
                        no, and listen that was different person - I am back, begging.
                        you used to be good person - joined course promise keeper - you have long road to climb - i do.
                        he is conflict oriented so when denied small argument, builds his energy. Oh, are you ever a match for this dude.
                        how you get confessions - eb knows there's sth wrong with them. some cathartic narrative they need. Eb has it.
                        the feeling that life slipped from fingers and future is behind you.
                        It's sphere to us. to them it's a circle - higher dimension where time is seen as a dimension
                        with tech these day you gotta be fucking genius to pass those things looking clean after thievery.
                        Rust knew who he was a there was no talking him out of it. Marty never knew himself so didn't know what to want.
                        God creates with flaws but doesn't see with flaws - nothing wrong with the way god made us - universe forgives all.
                        then became religion - he was humorous before !! Rust was intense man but he had integrity
                        quit. fk the world. nice hook marty (while angry with him - this is swag!)
                        Long time, changed your hair - thought of buying you a beer - comes back, btw why don't you buy me a beer.
                        we left sth undone so we gotta be together.
                        You are just throwing up stats - continues with the flow with no attention to the remark.
                        Be careful what you are going to be good at
                        she makes no sense - made sense to me - that should worry you mister.
                        Look I never told you how to live your live (implied that you don't tell me)
                        We were about to leave but then you woke up - what's your problem, Rust.
                        hands a box to Rust - are we engaged - in that case I would have put better ribbon.
                    Reflection
                            Philosophy of pessimism - can pessimism have strength to it.
                            prediction is mathematical expectation but optimism is hoping or biased prediction on outcome.
                                    to be realist in terms of probability and that is not literal but streak of events until that comes also is a probability based on as much as information we got.
                                    pessimism as hoping bad things is not a great idea cuz that's recipe for depression tablets.
                            eb thinks they are somebody but they are nobody - (very true from spiritual perspective)
                            darn sure none of these gonna split atom 
                                    a genius dedicated to the field anyways has low probability and conditional probability of those who don't display signs of genius is anyway low without more information
                                    so audience will readily agree with the motion - also premise of people doing useless things on screen.
                            showing hopelessness with the available grats of a layer - this is based on realism and can be empowering but without giving higher principle, the realism can make you depressed which ain't a good thang.
                            Pessimism can help you with power to improve things instead of accepting the evident sorry state. Like protagonist - continuously working to make things better.

                        It is not for use to decide how good or evil kira is - let history decide him we just need to catch him.
                        new eyes - I can kill those with alias. delete...delete.
                        writes down that I am being heard and continues to talk as normal while approaching the gate.
                        Neer - don't you think you should be working on the issue instead of playing games - while playing he says I already know who he is.
                        convenient allibi for kira else it is a hunch. Taking lead from where L left.
                        if he has figured out he is gonna give you trouble - it's fine I have a plan.
                        I accept your challenge N but you are gonna regret you crossed me.
                        Mr Prez you live long or not is up to you. Gimme names of all SDK members.
                        Kira's PR on news channels.
                        What is revealed is also part of plan - i am in japan - why tell me in mind.
                        M and N don't go together but feed each other - M gave info to N to get lead.
                        beat him in his game - what would they talk if they were face to face.
                        still considering those factors the probabilty of him being kira is very high - keep your eyes peeled.
                        man it's boring to get audio feed without video. talks whatever they want to hear but writes what he wants - seeing opportunity in adversity - made her as kira.
                                stay calm for showing no reaction but ....
                        Sorry for late - no problem I am night owl anyway.
                        gonna announce engagement in pub - does he know - yeah, of course you don't engage with yourself.
                        I find it unpleasant so leaving - I should have waited for you to grow up and learn some manners.
                                it was bad idea - I will know better next time. You are childish for storming out over silly little comment.
                        I know the significance of this move isn't lost on you.
                        put him in compelling situation where he is forced to take action.
                        let's meet - you suspect me to be kira so will I not kill you - and that will bring the case to close knowing who kira is.
                        bring notebook - sur but I will get to decide who holds it - does that sound fair?
                        N, You are much inferior to L - you have no right to wear the mask of L.
                        Light again 1 step ahead - he knew they would tamper page and this guy was just staged person - whose job was not to kill but write names for actual killings.
                        whoever name he doesn't write in the notebook is kira - but Mikami's notebook was real today.
                        why did he respond so calmly to your call - who knows maybe he has seen thru your plan.
                        if you have written all the names you can calmly come in.
                        No1 could attain goal and surpass L - together we can stand with L, surpass L - when we work as 1.
                        when I got notebook I knew I could do it; no, only I could do it. Who else could do it and come this far.

                                ugly world out there and uglier along - be thankful that it wasn't you and get on with your life - reason you became state alchemist ; can you afford to get distracted by every little lost cause.
                                this job is more real than I bargained - familiarize to the shit and organize with tucker's experiments - take over maniacs research - his findings can be of great use to military.
                                embarassment of trial and execution without trial - so covered it up.
                                and the task we gave - did you finish analysing tucker's research - investigate on your own and leave that here - I intended to.
                                we are not police - let's put our talents to better use thru research - if you have access, then that makes you state alchemist.

                                why do it - reduce to most building blocks - murder because they like to. war and people kill in most brutal ways - why they do so? deep down we all wanna kill.
                                        most just need a go ahead from society - like state alchemist - to blood 
                                It will take more than that to kill me - are you hurt? I really thought it was last - so scared.
                                called as distinguished achievement but he remembers it differently.

                        came out as good as ever.
                        first time treated like luggage travelling in sheep bogie.
                        he said don't die in his tenure - it is tough paper work.
                        he keeps telling about his illustrious stuffs - I will better try my luck with sheep
                        stole his legs - didn't your parents not tell you not to steal
                        please don't be scared - I am the armor speaking - I mean I am the new automation armor suit.
                                I am hearing voice - no, only 1 voice.
                        I am the cursed armor and I will steal your soul.
                        men are not men in battlefield - shut all emotions you have.
                                leg is a reminder - guilt remains after the war.
                        you smell like sheep - sorry for being luggage.
                        It's beautiful here and peaceful - yeah, it's rural; nice way to say that nth's going on.
                        Oh Lady Pinnacco - need some of your skills.
                                you left small - who are you calling small, you miniature sized. You are shorter than your temper.
                                shows his biceps - how dare you speak to granny like this - he clearly doesn't get the joke.
                        high speed screwdriver comes from nowhere and hits him on head.
                        how did you wreck automail the best automail - I put my heart and soul into that.
                        nth to do gets fidgety - daily training is essential for a soldier.
                        hates being called puny and ppl call him that more - must difficult there being puny and all..
                        this watch - stars in the eyes - this is the work of craftsmanship - look at the details - how is it done?
                                I don't care as long as it works. Can I see - you guys are stingy, ain't you?
                        Did I ever have friends - memory pile up and old things get wiped out.
                        Automail friend justifying no need for human limb
                                why go to all this trouble for human limbs when you have scent of oil, synthetic muscle; who needs natural when you have automail.
                                loose your machine junkie!! - alchemy freak, you.
                                nerves are connected not 1 by 1 but in 1 go.
                        such love for your brother - it's okay you are only getting in middle of the work - the stars hanging in air around his head fell hopeless.
                        train your body - I haven't hit tin can in a while - let me help you - no, we are fine.
                                don't get carried away and don't break yourself again.
                        you're strong but attitude is soft - you will never win like this.
                                too strong but together they smacked him down - one hit on leg and one for lifting.
                                you stole it you have nerve - carry my guilty motivation like little kid 
                                don't be dramatic - what are you getting teary about anyway - cuz you won't so I do it for you.
                                burnt the house? you have a home and family waiting for you.
                                come back soon - yeah, we will - home sweet home right?
                        why are we standing if library is waiting - why running, it's not running away.
                        fullmetal - I thought you would be more fuller and more metal - we don't need babysitters let's hurry.
                        we will help you - I hope you don't slow us down - don't take personally he talks like this to e1.
                        3 year old angel she is feet close to his hands - hey, can we use alchemy to send flame thru phone line to torgue the ear off.
                                there's another reason I called you.
                                enemies around here very high places - I am ready any time - make many friends for time comes ; crucial suggest find a wife - give it a rest - don't take it out on phone.
                                we know who didn't check out for who went inside and caused the fire
                        she always had nose on the book - people said I will die with my head in books...I never thought they meant it literally.
                                was about to die under the load of books.
                        plunged the great depths and height to find that book - shown with rope hanging to find a book.
                                I can relate it when you can't find a book you are searching for.
                                photographic memory - I will write it all. Every word as expected.
                                give her money from my budget - she giving this much money - has to have good reputation.
                        I will not be able to save you there - not getting to do your job is your problem...finding philosopher stone is mine.
                                alchemy was born in kitchen - decrypt his content for philospher stone.
                                they sure are too chummy with lieutenant colonel don't you think. Kept too busy to show up, sir.
                        don't sell yourself shortly - world wants people who are deeply into something.
                                you should know I pay better than ed.
                        I know what you are going to say and I know these boys will do whatever whether we give them permission or not - all that we can do is protect them our best.
                                they can find what no1 else can - as adults it's our jobs to enable them - when you have kids you will understand.
                                I would have liked to verify Marco's journal but makes no different now.
                        call this devil's work - quit or go insane by this - ingredient for philosopher stone is life of human beings.
                        going to their room - they're sleeping - changed his adamant mind to see him.
                        God must be really hating those who go against his will - fall on face - when got the fist..broken the teeth.
                                they say you sold yourself as dog of military - we have never stopped nor will this.
                        tin head does not get hurt - but hurt by the expression of it - e1 gathers "just cup sorry el".
                                what searching for would be abondoned so easily - don't know anything that's going around.
                                terrified to admit it was all wasted effort - it's ok to feel lost.
                                why don't do more research but without final goal - like a book mad and stop reading doesn't mean science doesn't exist. we will take this to finish.
                                went to 4 labs - nth going on except fast talking beaurocrats.
                                there were structural probs so 5th lab over there - that's their lie ...it must be blood of prisoners they are up to.
                        let us be your eyes and let us see if anything outside of ordinary - it's our duty.
                                ok do it can't argue - Sir, it's the right choice but goes there anyway.
                        need an energy boost - no!!! see the beatiful angel this 3 year old is.
                                for abondoned facilities security sure is tight - it gets more suspicious - try back.
                                can't fight in convenience - good we have metal limbs.
                                this is small I will be back - not my fault I am big.
                        good that I fit as small - good thing I am small - aaaah, I am nuts.
                        for all this trouble they offer - they have sth they don't want to be seen.
                        spherical ball rolling towards him saved by fitting in the void between cuboid and sphere - his smallness paid again not running away.
                        I have been waiting for you - you don't look welcoming with that sword.
                                you can call me 48 until you die today - I was prisoner - that links it perfectly that theory (while fighting)
                        I am number 66 - that's my work name. You fight with me - anything wrong happens to me a girl will kill me for automail.
                                I will not tell my other name lest you wet yourself.
                        don't know some idiot besides me got an idea to bind soul to armor. Now it feels unoriginal.
                        I know your weakness final warning b4 I kill. try to make it last - I won't be less strong at playing.
                                just like monkey ain't you - long time such responsive competitor. My body unlike you knows no fatigue.
                                is his competitor strong - not as strong as me - then no worries cuz I have never beaten him once. Assumption I am stronger than you.
                        I have come for you maggot - is that so? - what do you mean ppl get terrified - you should say aaaah...aaah what's wrong with your body.
                                are you an executed person at prison - I am not a crook.
                                blood seal on your mark and you die - so goes with you. but don't know where that is.
                                I will find it and I have knife - why do I have to get a crazy one to fight.
                                You are through, little man - fight you idiot don't call me little.
                                cut the chase tell me about philosopher stone - tell b4 I cut your seal - body is useless.
                                        another seal on the torso. brothers tied to head and legs.
                                they were mass murderer as brothers - foul play - all fair in war.
                                but I am not giving you time for alchemy.
                                I can't die here - who will bring el backt o normal again.
                                to kill a serial I will have to act like one. cut his other limb for making armor uesless.
                                I won't kill - we said destroy - if you are not human then same applies to brother.
                                hit him and says do we call it draw already I am worried about my brother. pip squeek is brother - he gets angry when you call him that - that changes eth.
                                        lovely brotherly love so wonderful. artificial affection - love is for real - if you fake and imitation tailor your memories to suit him - no it's me - that's the trick.
                                inhumane lives and so e1 called me and now that we are metal we are being called human - it's funny
                        if there's 1 sign that can destroy you - create many similar signs so that it is difficult to identify which is the one.
                                if you can't disprove it just accept it, you will feel better (psychological war) 
                                Whether I am human or not doesn't matter - I kill therefor I am - that's right, no need to prove that you exist cuz soon you will not.
                        not fair you didn't tell you had allies - allies? - gotcha! attack
                        stall time you want to know what that mark is ....press button I won't tell you.
                                be lab rats or come to bring hell to those above us ...I will ask only once.
                                don't connect us..can't be guard - think outside - will world let us - my brother is.
                                I gave him choice but still he chose to die
                        wondering why hunting him down - don't know the horrors of philosopher stone - not that I am thinking about it it's possible that..
                                can I eat them? the metal one may give you indigestion - I still wanna try.
                                many alchemist have failed - but you say I am not an ordinary alchemist.
                        Both talking as if alone and both have many listeners.
                        give their sacrifices meaning by completing the experiment. reasons for misguidance
                        I will personally go there says fuhrer when situation is too demanding.
                        after years of evolution you humans remained as violent as ever - who he thinks he is.
                        brigadier was killed by scar and I had front row seat - who are you? what you want me to be.
                        you think i will take their lives for giving you philosopher stone real - to get her body i gave their secret for becoming humunculi.
                        that won't be real nina - hits on head - this should stop you shut up and get to work.
                                we have to rely on others for alchemy.
                                desperate need for world domination? - want to be become humans like him. we were not created but just bored so became humunculi.
                                you misunderstand me - why should I do it for you - we are not asking. Brother it's not worth it - I don't want my body at the cost of others.
                                foolish child - I should have sent him to his maker when we had chance.
                                death is the high cost of living. this is what any adult knows - but we are not adults. became state alchemist as adults - can't be child again cuz can't have both ways.
                                I can't do it - helped by scar - take brother and get outta here - I don't need your help - maybe not but your brother does. proximity to stone makes him god.
                                for scar lives of people doesn't matter a lot.
                        forgive me in advance sir - slaps - that was wrong sorry.
                        arm not working - expected...I means you must have done sth wreckless this time.
                        I will take up from here ..give yourself a rest.
                        My wrong maintenance - no my wreckless behavior - yes, you are right.
                        tell me unless you want to become charcoal.
                        drink milk - easy for you to say el, lucky you didn't have to drink anything to get that big.
                        bundle of divine cuteness 
                        they are brothers - don't share and keep arm's length from me.
                                when needed you are the one they approach, that says sth.
                        taking burden of dying people for his skin - happy you did not compromise consciousness.
                        I don't know what to say - just say sorry you goof.
                        instill memories thru alchemy - created by you.
                        sitting on these thoughts for so long 
                        No need to prove you exist cuz soon you won't.
                        either stay here like rats or come with me to bring hell to others - I will ask just once.
                        will people accept us in this exoskeleton - my bro is.
                        What would I have done differently to prevent him die.
                        alchemy is distortion to world gave gave us.
                        can i eat them - the metal one can give you indigestion
                        he was killed by scar - I had front row seat.
                        does it mean - it does.
                        foolish child - I should have sent him to his maker when I had chance
                        life has a price and that's death of others.
                        I don't need your help - maybe not but your younger brother needs you.
                        I feel sorry for this in advance - slaps him in face and says trust adults with sth - not eth yourself.
                        I didn't have food - I will go get you food - why don't you help him - understood sir.
                        what happened - I passed out how I would know - don't gimme that.
                        I am so sorry for bad maintenance - no, I am reckless and move all around rough with it - (eyes flash he doesn't know it) yes, you are right.
                        very excited without sleep I finished it all - here's next - her soul left in front (as white cloud)
                        I worry for you whole life and you don't have decency to tell me what happened.
                        here's daughter isn't she abundance of divine cuteness.
                        he literally drags her outta love force - gift her teddy bigger than her.
                        that's gift from bookworm - she had tears saying bookworm.
                        If i didn't know, I would think you 2 as sisters.
                                they keep me arm's length to what matters. They do dangerous work and don't want others to be upset. You are counted on when they need you and that says a lot.
                        you don't have gift for Ed too - what's the use that will fade in front of your smile.
                        maybe he is upset that you considered taking 7 else's life - he would be upset if you gave him body at price of life of other humans.
                        I don't know what to say - just say sorry you goof.
                        brainwashing by the criminal didn't let El be at his best.
                        oh suit yourself why do I have to take care of the mule.
                        if i am nothing more than made up memories then what do i do.
                        this pile of junk spoke sth to us.
                        Ed, st answers never come until you ask questions.
                        he wants to forget his past and i want to remember it.
                        cherishing their getting together with tears of her part - we used to fight over candy - I don't want any of them. (till 24th)

                Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood
                        saw frightening knife - shrank to powder seeing him while saying long time no see.
                        metallic El - you have grown a lot than expected.
                        you have become military dogs - look at you have gone so big - your skills are so rusty.
                                not feeling well - shouldn't exert yourself - how sweet of you to worry dear sudden change.
                        ambiguous he left , when is he coming back; showing miracles in your field to father.
                        philosopher stone - lifelong dream coming true; always take pride in what we are giving you - she didn't change bit in this time.
                        you could see stars in the eyes (in hope); alchemy of punching them.
                        please be our teacher - I don't take students and in middle of sth - they were literally hanging on her arms while pleaing.
                                they turned white with sweat dropping.
                        one is all; all is one - find out in 1 month what that means - she left while their heads screams in the air.
                                they could see themselves on island from 10 km in the space.
                                which jerk considered alchemy training.
                                no better teacher than experience - if don't learn then even as alchemist they will be limited. So, give up as pupils
                                threw knife at him while conversing - he grabs flying knife with 2 fingers while continuing the conversation.
                        can't kill rabbit hey catching was my part - no fire, no food tell the plight.
                                hungry - saw man as meat piece, ants as walking chocolates - so gross.
                                I am alive cuz I ate ants - I am alive cuz I consumed life. I am still alive.
                                I am sorry and killed it. wood rubbing for friction and then put powder wood and blowing for fire.
                                ate frogs, etc. tomorrow is 1 month - unary numbering to keep track of days.
                                if didn't eat them - I would be eaten by them and would go into grass. food chain - under sea this island but future may make it mountain.
                                        all things are connected - e1 we see and meet - entire universe has us as ants - part within whole - putting all 1's together you make all.
                                        universe follows laws of magnitude that we can't fathom.
                                all is world and 1 is me - she laughs - training starts - very well now real training starts.
                        circulation of power - structural power in circle.
                                teaching them while they are attacking her.
                                they were on floor with their spirits standing in wait.
                                power exists in circle - to harness this power 1 must, make structural matrix over the circle.
                                respond to this - she was giant and he spurted yes.
                        should have told you sooner - taboo got her lose organs. No, I get to have list to look forward when body is back.
                                you darling little idiots - it's ok to hurt. We are sorry.
                        universe - reconstructed and deconstructed - what living is - it is like food chain - its flesh restructures to your body like grass for rabbit was restructured.
                                alchemy is part of flow and flow is life itself.
                        Sympathy but still you are expelled - thanks for eth.
                                expelled so you can speak to her as equal you stupids.
                                don't let her kill you - demon terrorizing them - we want to get our bodies back - get out now - we are staying.
                                awful (octopus hands) - can leave you insane, leave you brain ted - shrinking in front of their words.
                                I am boring compared to stories I have heard about you.
                                all of you are coming with me - there is a problem, sir, I just dating girl I really like - dump her - words threw him against the brick wall.
                        I know all about you - That's good there's a lot about myself I don't know.
                                come with us - I shouldn't go with strangers (14)
                                Humunculous - person made artificially. never crossed my mind you could get kidnapped.
                                fabricate your humunculous and I transmute your soul. no eating, no toilets, 
                                speaking in anger like winds over them. that move would have dismantled some people.
                                        you are not some people. care not if beat crap outta you but family raise finger then you freak out.
                                        those idiots can't help without getting kidnapped.
                                appreciate your effort but can't win. gave me time to think clearly.
                                noticed somethings you can't get hurt and heal at the same time. underestimated you.
                                so angry threw person at him. imbecile to not put broom away.
                                what the hell are you - housewife!!
                        they were not people but my possessions - I don't let them steal from me.
                        trade or shared information - then I will execute now.

                        don't show your ambition nakedly
                        why you wear this suit of armor - freaky hobby. So lovely view no.
                        literary - being burried under books - feels like heaven.
                                I remember eth - I remember the content - thank you, book worm you are my hero - transcribed it all.
                                there are amazing ppl in the world
                                this was a recipe book, great - so all this was a goose chase.

                                your fee - my watch and research grants she gets from mine.
                                did he forget to place decimals sw - how can boy of his stature make so much of money
                                alchemist research is dangerous and so is always kept encrypted.
                        L - section on green tea - green line of metallurgy reference.
                                why does this encryption have to be difficult - let's ask but that would be defeat.
                                it was glad to know that pathetic mess like me could help.
                                memory is incredible just have faith in yourself.

                                damn it; we cracked it but evil art - no stone without sacrifice.
                                try so hard to grasp truth but escapes. finally caught and dangerous to hold.
                                sth I wanted to tell but was afraid.
                                you may find truth hidden inside the truth !!
                                it must be lab 5 - ingredient is sacrifice and prisoners are executed in books EOD.
                                        it don't like it any more than you - probably if govt is involved - dangerous! That's why tolja to pretend you never heard.
                                behave yourself - aaaah! He was like all over the place in anime art - bull speak.

                        there were more than 1 idiot who came with the idea of bonding disembodied soul with armor.
                                perhaps i should intro myself again.

                                bargain - show us automail.
                                they were running to her - I won't let the thief go until I get a closer look at automail - they slid ran thru them.
                                in excitement, nose whisled like train.
                                designing these pieces is work of design - it's incredible while dancing.
                                that's why his growth is stunted - shut up! it bulbs.

                                        why closed with alchemy - cuz embarassed with it - don't forget the date.
                                horses running thru mind - what you wanna say - jumped forward with words.

                                                it's just the way.
                                                it's humiliating to be picked by a boy smaller than me. you know I can drop you any time.
                                it's a reminder of the day - how weak I am (to improve)

                                if wanted to give justice then why married - stayed like hanuman.
                        you became lawyer and marrying you made me stupid.
                        kahaan busy the - kya kiye din bhar
                        ham darshan ke liye aa gaye - ham shivling hain kya
                        business goes according to us not vv. useless bullets makes enemies and you won't know - bad business.
                        namaste gun gets pointed - baithiye sharminda kar rahe hain.
                        maa behen ek karne mein aasani hogi.
                        mistake hua hai crime nahi - and don't go courts for that.
                        saw how he raised his hand like flag
                        dushmani aukat dekhke ki jaati hai - how many can we kill in that party.
                        matter hamara why involving family - should have thought b4 - put hand in fire - st it will burn.
                                gotta go cuz if kaleen comes here then problem.

                        all guns of city in our control - in holder's control rather.
                                will you be able to save him every time - risk hai.
                                next time if you are not there then risk - if next time he comes and doesn't return back - risk there also.
                                        what do you do, valid argument - change topic - Mr Purvanchal ki tayyari. IAS - bank po maybe.
                                will you work for us? - pakka business - rather than couting other's money - count yours.
                        saying yes is risk and no also

                                family safe for that cause.
                        strong foundation for you else house falls.
                                why misbehaved with sister - seen me out of line with women - lady's happiness above.
                                agree - both? will come both else no1. eat with us? family eats together.
                                guns are for you - town will work under you and you under us. kaan fat rahi, etc

                                when run city - don't press your trigger - get men to do it - these are those.
                                greatest revenge is that they will work under you. 
                                maqbool - ask for maan and saying no he increases our.
                                why ask them to sit - little respect when doesn't hope then loyalty gets 10 times.
                                they are vafaadar but you are family. family so that's why waiting for virasat.
                        ramakant pandit for goon, he is don - i don't care; we do care - our not coming gets you worried so does us.

                        started UN projects- 2 things you care about ambassador
                        Awkward - right now. This video didn't help that either.
                                Sound during lunch.
                        Did you get lucky? career, are you crazy?
                                Like see you are great writer but when book comes out. No, no! you are a great writer. You say this project is amazing and weird show and becomes biggest.
                                Equate others' feelings with your own separate - GOT ppl like but I feel proud of other shows I have done. Don't let sth that fails define you - else I would be in Mental Asylum.
                                hacks happens so not even scripts - line by line - quite a luxury of any rehearsal.
                                She hasn't seen the show - but liked pilot
                                        7 you close with acting is bizzare. Separate thing it's job.
                                        It's like Baker - won't come to you can I taste that - I don't know why I came up with this but...It's been a long day - jet lag maybe.
                                        I can relate there are intimate scenes. I am not even talking about intimate scenes. Eg - Second chance - I can't see you cry.
                                        Take a good look at this picture - my gf was ur wife in that- how do u think it was for me? Well, ...laughs....(respect given)..I have got feelings too
                                                but u also see gf killing child in the movie - I didn't care about that - well,...when you do those scenes you don't have feelings.
                                                sth isn't right while I enjoy my icecream - no it's not right, absolutely. Yeah, like I coughed real hard when kissing scene in theater.
                        Explain course of events- he is very good singer, I am not. I sang my heart out - then heard it and was ready to kill myself. Changes and wow!

                The girl is finally no1
                        I have a different point of view.
                        I think the objective of being no one is to stop fearing death. Guess that’s what’s required to serve the many faced God efficiently.
                        Losing one’s identity and detaching from bonds eventually helps one lose fear of death. At least traditionally. But Arya is different. She has not lost her identity nor detached herself from emotional and moral bonds, yet she overcame the fear of death.
                        She decided not to kill Ms Crane(the actress) while being well aware that she was risking her own life by doing so.
                        She was not running from the waif in order to save herself, she was actually leading her into ambush well aware of the risks. (She could not have been sure of the Waif’s inability to fight blind).
                        And finally she went back to the hall of faces to give her tribute. She knew Haqen had approved her assanination, there was a good chance that he’d try to kill her. Yet she went as she owed the many faced God a face.
                        The route that Arya has taken is difficult, being brave is always harder than being fearless. But she has achieved the objective regardless. It’s a no brainer for Jaqen.
                        OR
                        The Waif came in after completing her job, wearing Arya’s face. Jaquen smiled because of the Waif’s dry wit.
                        OR
                        He trained regardless - she would be killing no matter if she stayed or not.
                        OR
                        When one loses their identity, it also means that one finds who they truly are.
                                all people wear masks, different versions of who they are. 
                                Because of fear, pain, and suffering
                                keep your heart and emotions safe, if you stop feeling and wear a mask - when they hurt, they hurt the "fake you"
                        Arya overcame a Faceless assassin and that made her ‘no one’.
                        considered a 'no ones' life as equal to hers and that is because she feels she is 'no one' too. So, came to place face there.
                        No surprise or amazement on arya's response reminding us we still know nth of their motivations.
                        “No-one” understands that the life of one individual in not ‘more or less’ valuable
                        I can’t change that. No One can. Arya became no1 by changing that.
                        She gave up the identity as kid Arya.
                        arya was able to kill a noone clearly points to a huge favour from the many faced god. Also the debt of one life was paid by arya when she killed the waif as a replacement for her own.
                        "A girl is arya stark and i am going home". 
                                Meaning she has accepted that she is a noone now and as a noone she can be whoever she wants. She chooses to be Arya and start with her contract.
                        Jaqen was not justified cuz she chose needle (weapon of PERSONAL choice) - "a man" was trying to save himself from getting pierced by "a girl"
                        Being faceless men requires a form of acceptance.
                        A face was promised and you did bring Waif instead. So, rituals have started.
                                Did you notice that it is because the waif closed the door that the room of the final fight goes dark...
                most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear (not org)
                        Indeed, if you know you have only one chance to succeed at something, and you believe absolutely in the need to succeed
                                save the city, so his survival was imperative
                                fear could increase focus and success
                        humans look up to the superhero, it is not fearlessness in the face of death that we seek to emulate, it is the courage to embrace our own power to achieve the most noble pursuit we are capable of 
                                strong willingness to embrace the ideal
                                primary motivation is deontological – Bruce Wayne does what he does in promise to his parents. He always keeps his promise, and it is his resolve that his enemies fear most.
                        considering that he fights and puts himself in harm's way as he does, a fear of death is not one of his fears
                                Although he trusts the technology behind his gear, and the design behind the technology, a fear of death would hamper his ability to perform his death-defying stunts and acrobatics.

                                fear of losing his sense of humor is the most powerful motivating factor in Spiderman's life.
                                X-men are different but wolverine doesn't fear death.
                        I do fear death. I fear dying in here, while my city burns, and there's no one there to save it.
                                "I do fear death, I fear dying here" but taken alone out of context, you miss what it is he actually fears, which is the death of Gotham, not the death of Bruce Wayne or the death of Batman.
                                doesnt fear bodily death he fears a worst kind of death, the death of his spirit
                                death of his life mission, protecting the people of Gotham - failure
                                forcing his will to summon all the inner strength within him because if he doesnt commit 100% he will not only die physically, but spiritually as well because he failed to protect the people of Gotham from certain death
                                bomb away from the city showing that he is willing to die if it means that his life mission is complete, saving Gotham
                        Fearing loss makes you weak.

                    In comedy, repetitive jokes of one theme create boredom like double meaning words - PaaS, SaaS, REST, etc.

                    T2 you should be clear as to where to go cuz in T3 you gotta exhibit for T4 (specialized)
                    R&D is this architecture direction only.
                    CTO is one who has vision for technology besides knowledge but he ain't expert
            Faster work than germany so they reconsider their stand.
                    Cross team dependence - your code should be black box for other teams
                    contributing to work of other teams offers you no visibility - backlog is what you are supposed to do.
                    so take a stand that we are stuck cuz of other team - let mgmt know it.
                    a person would get his backlog ready for next releases but won't show it - will show it only later on that this guy is very fast.
                    specialize in most valuable thing - customer recognition => 5K but also increased value.
                    our visibility comes to manager thru PO, Architect, Scrum master - if all are happy, they will tell in SAP Talk.
                    Corporate culture is such that smiling faces but it's pyramid and if you show sth, they gotta show that they are better.
                    Corporate is not a game of work hard but work smart - make your work visible.
                    Proposing Innovation Topics, DemoJAM, participation in hackathons, winning challenges are great ways for visibility.
            Startups - 
                    More technical work but pressure and handling.
                    Specialization in sth but big tag with your name - ppl expect you know eth - you are that big tag (in completeness)
                    switching to higher stages of ladder - eg - vishal sikka. Why Google CEO so young but came up there - cuz of Chrome Project and showing it off well.
                            some VPs resigned on his appointment - but he showed it off well.
            he would come late from office cuz what the heck I would do with that guy - induced fight with others
                    would induce - there should be no politics between friends (but material world name of game - perceptions)
                    they were not happy with previous guy - he was money minded - fought over unnecessary things he forced e1 to buy.
            1 person works butts off but other LOBs Cost centers get margin of their profits why - so decided to part with HCM - independent funds.
                    in industry, you gotta identify people's egos - you may be right but politically also you gotta be.
                    a developer can propose a change to architect thru a channel - like to Scrum master - ego is hurt => no impact.
                            developer also has to learn to code under constraints of architecture and demands and expectations - while bringing the best to the table.
                            in colleges we learn subject but not art of work.
                    PO sees this - it gets noticed that this person conducts trainings. He is contact guy for a topic, etc. So it's not arbitrary.
                            talent is a must / necessary but there should be proper showcasing also.
                            what are you useful for - prove yourself useful - he proves himself as useful - an asset for me - it would impact me if he leaves - kinda attitude.
                            people very quickly accept you in the role you have adopted (provided you are worthy, deserving and capable of handling it)
                    The thing with politics is it's not in your face - it goes on under the surface - the game of impressions and personal likings.
                            the seniors have their tactics to establish their being alpha.
                    politics should be non-confrontational in nature - it's all good on surface but who's good for me; who's a threat - those basal insticts continue to exist.
                    Ignorance is bliss as a matter of fact - cuz on application layer of abstraction you care little or spiritual layer of abstraction you see Truth and shallowness of eth in front of that.
            Black mirror telling us about human nature through the technology we wish for, but don't deserve
                    high-concepts with more traditional storytelling to effectively hold that black mirror up to our own society
            Nosedive
                    Curiously, to a large extent society functions this way already.
                    When strangers meet, their initial conversation is often appraise the other person in terms of status and potential use in the future. Rarely is it for friendship.
                    Any business-type social gathering is blantly like this.
                    In this episode, this evaluation is carried out via smart technology, extending the possibility of appraisal without actually needing to meet the other person.
                    This removes the awkwardness of speaking to somebody considered to be of lower status/no use in another's life. 
                    The stilted conversations in the lift are an excellent example of what can be avoided by judgemental people with the smart technology.

            Gossips, TV series are like case studies - reading case studies without conclusion and ability to affect decisions is a wastage of time.
                    People may know score of case studies but all useless if conclusion ain't reached.
                    Of course, you get entertainment but not truth, the best outcome possible.

                7 goes surprise me. Getting your own chit - then gift yourself.
                Amazon voucher as gift!! Or amazon link shortened as tinyurl and gift me this.
                7 goes to too specific - better give a tinyurl!!
                I should have written 2 CSS NG tickets for hotfix - we are worked up with it.
                last year some of them added a spice to it - gotta do some activity thru email - should be RAW compliant.
                gotta guess who gifted you sth then the chain goes on - every correctly guessed gifter guy has to identify who gifted unto him.

                    no fuel how did he manage to avoid nosedive - full force on the hands.
                            After that, should stop travelling or what - get into cockpit and say first, show me the tanky before I board.
                            Error was Kg interpreted as pounds by tank fillers - human bug.
                    35 sec buffer to do emmergency landing on water - could have done in another airport thru simulation but needed 35 sec to decide - simulation will fail considering that.

            do you work on weekends - I try not to but succeed most of the times.
                    Karthik said he feels boredom without working on system - that could mean that you don't have hobbies - or it could mean that ByD is one of your hobbies.
                    happy weekend - yeah, I hope so...have sth to finish.
            Group Discussions
                    we are going in wrong direction with the discussion - talking meta in Group discussion.
                    for me, that would be schema - in that case, I would do that.
                    better if we talk concretely here - some younger colleagues may find it difficult with abstract terminologies.
                    that's the problem with X - they focus on broad aspect of it but miss.
            PJ vs GJ
                    lines get blur - not give a laugh if you find it PJ cuz Jokes are quite subjective.
                    word manipulations - many don't find it very amusing - so that's typical target for labellism.
                    offended once when someone in Siemens said that to me - I said some people don't deserve good jokes - then she was offended.
            Mysore vs bangalore - similar but more variance in bangalore.
                    3rd in Snookers. Stabilizing in current career - online courses are really good. this exceed nptel in that practical goes along with theoretical.
            Discussion
                    How to make internal tables here - bhai, it's a different world.
                            Life of SAP vs outside - more problem solving - here eth handled by framework - we get to work on business side of things but X4 then also framework.
                            ABAP Basic you know - don't insult that publically been working on it 2 years - no, it's different - I know abap that I code on - that's my basic..that's my advanced.
                    proximity to office discussion - so close that take a run up and jump to your home from top floor. other side of the wall but I am insaan.
                    day and night ticket ticket ticket ...I start getting the feeling of a ticket collection.
                    outbound this year - here we are not sure about byd you talking outbound - the fear that outbound should not be out of the company.
                            I asked Pankaj he said which org it comes under. Asked Manager - see this is not all I ask, he would say bhai do some work also that you planned while joining company.
                            not that my manager - what is this year's plan - sir let's go Kerala - bhai I am talking development! - no, it's not that.
                    Not mahabalipuram - stones everwhere - patthar patthar.. go that side, patthar.. aankhein patthara jaati hain...bhai patthar ke alava koi fool hi dikha do.
                            but good reminder of what we studied in 9-10.

                    2 weeks to banta hai. but marriage so enjoy the current phase fully.
                            mother's birthday - what sirji, such events should not be missed.
                                    could have come back on monday. Yeah, I am already married - oh! so it's time to enjoy!
                            retirement of father - keep engaged after work else psychological sense of age comes. Right over relaxation btw.
                            We have already spent 10 years in ByD - congratulations 
                                    All big players here - 1-2 yrs still seem like baby to me.
                    we had 500 tickets - 100 in 1 person's account - better give KT to customer and ask them to solve their tickets themselves.
                            another team tensed that got 15 tickets in team - here 1 person has that much. Such bad jokes not allowed baby.
                    I eat lotta sugar - then you must be having sugar flowing in the veins and blood percentage in sugar is to be measured.
                            but as long as you do exercise or play - it is all fine.

                    Kormangala for food, Shivajinagar also - tasty.

                                    Eg - Now that we have another facility of intercity travel thru bla-bla car - this attempts to address the human need for transport (remember all chapters of SSc)
            Asking silly questions from seniors vs quality questions
                    "SEE! That's what I would suggest in this situation" - asked how is absl code mapping with its abap equivalent - the files themselves were different (silly mistakes!!)
                    What is the degree of confidence with which you are carrying out a step - it can be as simple as walking - no1 should be able to challenge you in that.
                    be sceptic with others and also with oneself. What is the degree of confidence with which you make a statement.
                    Try swimming in shallow waters first - don't be overly enthusiastic with the framework when you are not even supposed to know its working as part of your job.
                    but knowing it is an added advantage in your CS life but first things first - don't forget the priority and what's official and what's personal - what is the basis of contract.
                    avoid deep dive in the official times unless it is really necessary
            Discussion with Mukesh
                    Oiling with the team - feel free to approach them and they are helpful - very soft-spoken carry on the legacy.
                    Maintenance is high but see an opportunity there. Talk to support for all consulation related topics.
                            do structured learning to ensure that you have complete model and tickets are more of problem solving on that model.
                            2 hr/week to be dedicated for the domain learning.
                            take help from Nirosha or Karthik on where to find material.
                    Gradually we will have more development.
                            ngap is going to be replaced by react.js framework so we are gonna comply with our ESF2 framework.
                    vertical growth of people I do look at; when 1 person moves to other team, there is vacancy created and someone else also gets a chance to replace.
                            horizontal related to topics then project grows. unrelated then you grow in your understanding.
                            young then energy so use it - try ESF2 framework for UI and mobile - dummy hey why not use case study material.

                    All customer systems are VM
                    Our BYD is on SCP; Leonardo API on AWS - communication through REST API so no issues there.
                    All UI and back end Changes go to xrep. Why don't we use GIT? Benefits
                            any change we make we gotta double maintain for HFC - imagine if we had GIT - then just maintain changes to another commit!!? That's what we do when we open a system.
                            ability to work on local copy while development system is unavailable.
                            lock issues with the current development framework - 2 people can't work on a file at the same time.

                    why mess up during interaction - basics not strong enough that any puzzle will be solved. Or cluttered with instability of the concepts - still not rooted.
                            Not relaxed - stay relaxed. Observe others for reference.
                                    face public - practice that thing more and more.
                                    record or write documentation for yourself until you face public.
                    spend some time for standardization.
                    I will continue until I solve it - you can go if you want - a sense of separation is created.
                            Tu to ehsaan faramosh hai jovially - he didn't call again for a few days.
                    use your independence by declaring dependence - we do lose freedom when we invest in some love.

                    Don't let stagnation come - keep changing projects for wider understanding of technology and keeping relevance.
                    get into ML and stuff it's best opportunity in here.
                    Gotta spend extra time in new project so not doing across company for now!
                    Don't get stuck in abap - spending more time doesn't favor.
                    But learning as long as here - when stagnation start coming - switch!!
                    Daughter - muttering words ML. 6 months powder milk for health and grinded grains get digested. Feels different as father - excited to go home.

                    touching the right nerves of emotions - new life, aye.
                    drill down the questions - new apartment when you took how far is it, where she works, etc.
                    other details of importance - where she works, she is localite, etc.
                    good wishes - may you make 1 and 1 to 11. Have a set of good wishes else you will yourself feel bored while wishing them.
                    These details should be cached in your mind for spontaneous flow of events or questioning.
                    get or seek celebration details - these are not empty enquiries - they contain ideas, feeling happy for them (tapping into their mind), etc.

                            they don't remember context with Mitsuku. It was quite good but used only regex.
                                    but Google appointment - you can't tell if you are talking to someone else.

                                    so much money involved - customers find their work around - about 20K euro involved - so much loss of money cuz they chose ByD as their vendor.

                            there should be bathing facility in here. I think there is near gym.
                            you also think the same - I don't know ...I can't see myself so accepting your version.
                            It's ok to look tired and be mentally active than vv.
                    Vishesh - told manager about team change then go - no germany plan.

                    Sometimes are busy thinking about some issue and walk around like a zombie - yeah, I saw you talking to yourself!
                    The only ideology politicians support is being in power.
            Discussions around - Maharaj saying no bridge preaching absolutely pure in your devotional service execution. Rocking Kirtan - but many devs have come thru it.
                    yena kena prakarena manah krishna niveshayet,
                    fan slowing takes time so let person have flexibility to not be rejected from PD standard,
                    Krishna says not to unsettle those - but SP says devs do. 
                    Let a person have the flexibility to drive in 2nd gear - it may take them more time, maybe lives but so be it. 
                    Life is not 0 and 1 but different scales in between. KC is not scaled 0 to 1 but -INF to +INF - how can we force someone to be at 100 when Krishna has scales 
                            no, that's parampara standard - that's fine as temple standard and shishya standard but not life standard.
                    form vs substance
                            Milk in gold, silver or brass - it's milk but has differences acc to ayurved.
                            10 Rs as note, coin or electronic - it means the same thing.
                            so KC in dhoti kurta, or pant shirt - all the same.
                                    yes, but there's recommendations - which is more favorable for DS
                                    RG doesn't say somehow or other DS so watch TV and chant.
                                            chant during watching is ok but watch during chant is not.
                                            difference is in what's your attachment and what's needful.
                                            watch TV maybe attachment and chant is an addition of your choice (not recommended one) - but that's ok and will help spiritually but may bust you materially after some time.
                            also for neophytes to engage their art is good but eventually, for initiates the bar is raised - of not dovetailing but giving up all ego. But that's PD standard - guru decides the bar for their disciples.
                    Even in devotee community, we have conservatives and liberals - this pull push helps GBC remain stable around the mean (normal distribution). It is desirable to have normal distribution - that's the meaning to be human.
                    you seem to be confused with things that you quote everything you are ok with - that's life; it's not 0 and 1 - but lots of real numbers in between - one with highest probability takes effect and that's fine.
            Discussion with Tejinder (Punjabi staying in SLS Square) - working with qualcomm
                    Studies in foreign - duration of 5 years to finish masters.
                            the dates come out for a quarterly course - choose to enrol in a set of them.
                            as soon as you get 45 credits for the masters you can get a degree.
                            CS101 vs CS301 - 301 is advanced course for masters - people take it cuz somewhere in their phd they need it.
                    Programs in stanford - Professional Programs, graduate certificates (BE), degrees.
                            every program has a set of courses under it.
                    Game Theory - cost function updates on action from any dang person so discipline inculcated.
                            in politics also game theory - criticism, high expectations and they become sober.
                            world is like context free grammar - where every input from an agent changes the state besides giving the output - here many agents affect the state simultaneously.
                            business doesn't care for country - they care for given, the situation what is the best that can be done.
                            I suggest you do PhD from outside just in case - from India not that much worth.
                            it is cheaper to study from abroad while staying in India - your cost of living stays low - outsiders gotta work as well. and can go there twice - so planning to go there recruitment time. But more weightage to personal business in India - make product not so much into starting start up.
                                    they also can finish in 5 year window but what's more economical - finish as soon as possible to save on hostel fees.

                    2mro is his last day - where are you going - MBA? - pura bol - MBA in IIM Ahmedabad. So now I know you...more importantly you know me.
                    so you become CEO of some company and then give our referral.
                    Now you know me - so why you are here - oh, you are already in management mode! - not gonna complain to your manager - now you even know my name - so knowing me didn't have just one dimension.
                    he also sits in the same room 2nd floor of the building - you have bright future man - yeah, I know cuz of the vibes, right!!
                            you saw me there some time? - yes didn't want to disturb you - could have come to say hi (only say hi and not more!!)
                    once in 2nd floor room they caught us sleeping hand stretched - he didn't say sir i can arrange you a pillow, too impolite - yeah, I also feel drowsy in that room, I guess vibes again!
                    I don't know I don't like to sit at desk after office hours - we too we all move to each other - that can be dangerous you all end up in another place assuming the other has left.

                            but don't cross Pankaj else I will lose head count - sir, here my life is going, you are worried about headcount!
                    I paid 28% GST over my flat I also paid 28% for my bike - comparing the rates of the 2 I am worried you should not get lynched here.
                            political analyst career. They ensure that it gets difficult for next term - fewer sources from next term - no tax till 5L, GST reduced to 5%, education quota. Smart politics.
                            How is siddhu - sir, siddhu can tell better. All that he used to say for BJP now says about congress true dal badlu. He did better as commentator than as cricketer in terms of money.

            Discussion - Test Driven Development and factors for salary
                No Test Driven Development cuz less time and more amount of work.
                        vs Flipkart less work (only CRM part) - not warehousing - for that they must be using another thang.
                                More customers, less work - concentrated effort so do TDD and earn also hell lot.
                        ERP lots of work, less customers who want end to end and hence less money and distributed between employees in proportions so less salary.
                                ByD was a bad deal - any investor withdraws and ends up with lesser money. It was a lossy deal. couldn't find many customers.
                                change pricing model for customers, but then they may withdraw and losing customer worse than they paying less.
                        gotta keep acquiring - that's what is necessary for their survival. Many start ups with ambition to get acquired and earn money - that's their business model.
                                why open to investors if you may be talented - but no guarantee for sustaining it and so acquire more - also you must open your company on equity for safer hand.
                                Hotel you earn a lot but open up so that continue earning - say competitor comes then gotta upgrade but late now.
                        why not recruit more cuz gotta pay to them also and Money is less
                        No it is distributed - so many areas to work on so

                    Explained myself honestly and fully - a person not in alignment will feel upset. I am not afraid cuz I am not dishonest.
                            honestly tell about yourself and disalignment will be exposed in form of being upset.

                    I fear - not thought about it. I fear my values.
                    having fun but reminding to stay rational.
                    judging is very natural - what people mean is don't create a hostile atmosphere.

                    not very interested in coding - but management I like but not every thing people have to do (then make it work for you - the way you believe in) - considering them resource.
                            whatever you like pivot to it and accept the famous existing models and fine tune to work it for you.
                            if you don't the existing one for its practical-ness and your belief system - make it work for you.

                                    this also has less priority than others - cuz people like talks about them.
                                    eg - how byd gets affected - we can start matrimonial solution or module besides others. Matrimony management.
                            Independent Master data - not relevant to talk about it here unless a reason.
            Discussion with Sonia
                    Strong tea pasand hai - mujhe to milk pasand.
                    Health - Tumor some years back but 2-3 years back removed and keen interest started.
                            not cured but remained. Courageous to tell it honestly. Immune system snubs it.
                            Yoga - after 40 - it hurts me - power yoga.
                    Spirituality - my god has to be superior.
                            Shiva is Krishna's guru so that's fine. Her brother also pujari kind.
                            Spirituality to me ain't fear or desire only but also duty and love.
                    Bangalore is must cuz parents girls take good care.
                            Bangalore stay is serious to me. I want stability in life. IT life - better prospect - of course, other factors into considers.
                            trying to talk me into it. Parents ok with me going to Mars with NASA now ISRO. All people away from home face this problem.
                    Talked to your parents - 
                            very jovial like other Punjabis. Fun loving girl.
                    Philosophy so high - don't get it - speak simple. It is part of the package.
                    fears - 420 ki dhara. explicitly than implicitly evaluation.
                    short tempered - lose calmness in hot mood but early maan jaana - parents ko buraa lagta hoga - mujhe bhi to.
                            threw hot tava against the wall - could not hit younger brother - but that could be dangerous right.
                            consult psychiatrist btw.
                    you didn't ask if I had a relationship - Delhi Orkut friend who ended up being SC, poor acads willing to help and distanced for his studies 
                            and he had other relationship which he didn't tell but was found it; also fuss over SC he had fight so ended relationship.
                            That's why loyalty important to her - even in office she has met many people - even b4 marriage it's understadable but not afterwards.
                    what about you - once a girl asked me for dinner but I denied - shy - no, I was into spirituality.
                            no crush - no. just healthy talking. I didn't want someone to mess with my values.
                    There has to be a serious balanced with jokes - like car drive and enjoying in the way - life is a serious fun.
                            Your family also equally funny - there is a scale of 0 to 1 and eth happens - who's more?
                            In general I am very serious guy - I can't believe it as you say it - no I am. So, that's my point in meetings we end up showing only our positive side.
                    You showed courage by telling your negative side so here'e mine - brutal honesty to tell it - should not cause problem in future.
                            Infy money but no project cuz M.Tech and chose 3 months salary.
                            so what's wrong in that love - love job not company - but here I was not even loving  my job.
                    You love your job - I do. Your craft means a lot to you.
                    What's your fears - understanding, caring, loyal. I like to believe that I am all of that.
                    Close to your family - very Eg when I was not well with viral fever.
                    What's the deal with your salary can you talk about it - it's 9.05 - I think 9 should have been ok - well if that 0.5 goes missing we end up shaking whole HR.
                            what's with yours - don't ask - if you feel awkward that's fine. Responsiblity of man to earn, female is just an add on - belief system of e1.
                            you ask a lot about my bank - well our growth depends on that right. Stocks grow then your interest also in that.
                    What's really important to you - my values, my beliefs, freedom but freedom is something that has to be channelled and that's where we choose to restrict it for growth.
                            if not, then we end up living a life that's not true to ourselves so crucial point in time of choosing your life partner.
                            if not same frequency, more of impedance than win win scenario - business contract. we are looking growth.
                    Do I tell you something you are very funny - I told you that I am more serious than funny but you took it as another joke...what to do!!
                    Anywhere you felt disappointed just let me know
                            yes you too - it is not about being disappointed but being rational with mutual expectations and being mature and conscious about it.
                            For me the only concern being your nomad nature of wandering around 
                            package also a being a bit lesser than I expected.
                    Any concern from me
                            you didn't like me being philosophical..you know how hurting that was to me. Hain? no you be yourself no stopping on that.
                            no discouragement on that - no never lose your individuality for anyone that's what makes you different from others.
                    samajh nahi aata...sirf nomadic hona hi dikkat hai aur kuchh nahi
                    have you been in talk with any other girl and why that didn't work - I had experience few months back when I was being assertive and spoke up against sth I didn't feel right.
                            had a talk with my sister and sth she didn't like so I had to be assertive that I really love my family.
                            she had problem with that so couldn't continue. And that itself tells that we couldn't be together although I may have respect for other aspects of life.
                    Career difference shoould not make a difference - I solved a bug causing compilation problem - not understandable.
                    brutal honesty is good but politically not mature - if lie, it can be caught through series of questioning.
                            time wasted if didn't work out - no it will be cuz you gain experience.
                    It's definitely fun with her but didn't got chance to get into the value system a lot like talking about spirituality deep stuffs and career deep stuff like timings.
                    From last meeting
                            Krishna fan - yes, fan I am.
                            Gravity of how deep - Law of attraction so have fun in life and don't fear falling on concrete - Law of gravity is more immediate it seems and then takes you up there.
                            Less interaction so why judgmental - expression delayed.
                            let them be - manipulation all the time so accept it. Even as people talk to each other.
                            love yourself; health competition with friends and in glow, cleanliness, short tempered - the focus is more on solving the problem in coding.
                            Mental layer should no become all important but should serve higher layers. Who with parents - protective feminine nature.
            Discussions with Akanksha
                    dinner - No fruits today - good for me else bhukha hi maarna tha - I didn't say that I had something - matlab bhukha hi maarna hai
                            but I did take something else - paav bhaji makkhan aur paneer maarke and litti chokha - wow - aur aapka chilli paneer - roz wahi khate kya?
                    Seedha javab kabhi na dena - why shy from being smart it is good to be smart.
                            I don't want the game of bujho to jaane in personal life - I am being straight forward but having a little fun doesn't hurt.
                            let the fun stay out for some days - no, it comes with the package, sorry
                            why I let you assume that I am smart - if you are not you would take me to be extra terrestrial.
                    with parents
                            any expectations - koi akanksha (her name also) nahi hai! sanskari, our child should like.
                            shadi in day or night - any time sardars do in daytime but pandit muhurta basis we decide.
            Communication
                    Some people use smartphone even in rest rooms - ok, I will stop using it. Hey, you start getting advertised accordingly.
                            and some people receive calls while in rest room - I am in wash room right now ..just don't pick phone - what if modi calls you and asks for suggestion on Kashmir issue.
                    Experiments - Russian Sleep Experiment - good that you got sleep after hackethon otherwise cannibal holocaust in SAP.
                            we take some very simple opulence for granted - now as I am saying this I am thinking SME.
                    Experiment on Teacher giving attention - bias of who are smart - smart got smarter and other ignored equally smart became less smarter on subject.
                    Experiment of some people kept in toxic environment and they became such - good result but bad methodology - why make them garib.
                    Marshmallow experiment - so if you starve yourself for something higher you get it - what do you starve for - I showed the snacks plate I was eating.
                    Keeping your smartphone blocked for camera and microphone and what not - Ideally we should not even have smartphone - what about microphone - well you can break it.
            Communication
                    while giving presentation - it is better to give something cluttered than to not give at all.
                            now keep improving on gradient descent.
                            similarly to participate as correction during presentation - it is better to try and fall short than not try at all - then gradient descent.
                    he said that already - ability to say what he said and how his context differs from mine.
            Presentation
                    request with payload - why you ask what you ask explain that
                    you decide and accept - whatever the presenter wants - he asks you to read through, you do but if objected, then either explain it away or comply.
            Communication
                    I will also go with you for rest room - that's called friendship other person gets scratch - yes but piss in your own cabin no friendship there.
                            you must be aware of oberon - yes I have heard the name
                            no method available in exit - so should we beat the people saying who will give remove row, rascals.
                    we contribute the world laziness
                            finger gesture to increase volume - ac vadaa dyo ultimately we want to sit on sofa and order things like vegetable.
                            that's what we do we automate everything - let's keep contributing to world laziness.
                    I also went to gulmarg te tharr ke vaapis aa gaya.
                            sking da ki, mein snow vi nahi vekhi.
                            last post b4 pakistan - can't boast in front of us cuz we are 2 Km away from Pakistan.
                                    that also is 2 Km away - could have just stepped and boasted we came from Pakistan but no guarantee that for the step someone will not send a fire.
                            Asian costly hotel - Khyber - 500 Rs tea cup - what tea had kesar or in golden cup - kesar it didn't even have ginger 18% GST separate.
                                    we still got tea - our friend got 2 banana for 200 - got banana from some vendor outside.
                                    See this hotel - does the girl come with it - no - saanu te o hi chahidi hai you keep the hotel with you. saanu te unna ka hi chahida hai.
                                    Lalit hotel in Goa also costed 20K per night - yes, luxurious hotels right.
                    for extra head count talk to jurgen - SRM doesn't want 1 lesser head We are willing to take that risk - you sent friendship only for a toss.
                            I didn't agree to the argument if you manage good then you will get - we will do good if we get now - if we could do good without it, then why would we need extra resource.
                    neighbor approval for house in Germany - gotta have to relationship with neighbors.
                            people will welcome you from there - you are one implementing GDPR next law there - why keh ke lena or lapet kahe rahe ho.
                    Ravish got magsaysay award - pleasure listening to him but biased like others which is fine - that's what media is supposed to do anyway.
                            public is foolish - they have right to be foolish. GOT - all I wanted was to have the freedom to make my own mistake.
                    you are chief guest of the meeting - I thougtht I was the host of ByD - not chief guest but cheap guest saste cha mil jaanda hai.
            Communication 
                    First time cook talks to create amicable nature - dada what's cooked today, wah, aur bataiye kitne baje free ho jate ho, 
                            abhi ghar kitne baje pahunchenge, par personal vehicle hoga na, kahin ghar jaake order to nahi karvaoge.
                            aapki family mein kitne log hein, aur yahaan kitne jan rehte hein, ghar kitna door hai yahaan se.
                    So you had great time - yes - then we can start troubling you again.
                    Hard skin/ Pakke DheeTh - what the heck with any darn thing. It is we who give weight to thing and well we should cuz VA
                            Eg - 2 month postponing a ticket cuz it was complicated. Not afraid of meetings but when roadblock it's gotta be addressed.
                    Long breathing practice so that never nervous.
                    Today Tuesday - what's the deal with it - no chicken today - lucky them - but we eat them tomorrow - unlucky them..bali ka bakra kab tak khair manayega.
                    you are a hardcore gamer - no, I am not - then what you are softcore gamer ...why you laughing bro
                    I have done ball dancing also - what kind of people you have recruited, X.
            Case Study with Sonia
                    Bangalore based - family carrying over - make it clear job is movable.
                    short tempered - invokes anger to family, taking for granted but values and idolizes - won't tolerate the wrong.
                            like mother I am short tempered - father ain't so he tolerates and kich kich chalti rehti.
                    frustrates then dance - what's in mind - ask her past - is it over with e1, etc.
                            what frustrates - anything people, mind, etc.
                            bhangra on any beat
                    loyalty, etc - extra marietal affairs in office - in india it is strange thing
                    family is eth to me
                    philosophy side up - when will it finish. God is more of help in life.
                            philosophy is inseparable part of me (see in beginning e1 likes it but to live with it is not simple thing)
                    easy going. I ain't never leaving my things - though I am flexible. I hope that's not problem. Clarity should be starting point.
                    hansmukh you are
                    manager - child then teaching. not into work that much.
                    in free time - household chores.
                    simple vs smart vs cunning - clever and smart is good. simple people i like and clever is good case study.
                            political correctness is so important in material world.
                    is life partner below or above career - love in material projection should be more important.
                    DS - timelines are important
                    family is support system that's always with you so most valuable thing - concerned with her parents a lot.
                    very health conscious - 1 hr in the morning is must and yoga reserved for after 40 - science not so much.
                    adventure sports - risk - only some weight will be reduced - coorg I went. Friends many and have not been keeping in touch (more of reciprocative relp in short term)
                    value system from father always truth. like lizard story - if saw then told.
                    pretty much south indian - knows kannada and doesn't like north much. But can speak in hindi - she said that in english.
                    may not work in future until child is born and then teaching - not of commerce line (BEd no!) so some regular stuff probably - 70% in maths in school days.
                    boose once with husband - that's very unlikely given what I am.
                    egg in cakes if don't know else no.
                    shiva is kula devata - which one is yours - I don't know - all philosophies have their place even atheism, may seem very non intuitive 
                            in fact all theories exist inside of us - they just need to be given right weight.
                    not so much of social media - yeah, wondering why no whatsapp usage.
                    what is programming - maths was good subject.
                    sports - what in sports - basketball and school days cricket.
                    father is atheist but very ethical and caring.
                    doesn't like political manipulations - friendly talks but mails indications so stopped talking and then ok.
                            that girl behaves some bad way - how bad, stop associating with her - no, cuz I should know how to deal with different kinds of people.
                    entertainment - anything that comes on tv (so easy going)
                    kind of friends and looking for in people - no bitching, 
                    fat vs thin people - I like them all. But I like thin people and not fat ones.
                    amicable and family oriented - fighting with family so bad. telling husband that you are in their control.
                    I want someone who listens to me and not family is right business.
                    programming is mathematical abstraction of reality in OO terms and algorithmic terms.
                    I know cooking, and all household chores - mummy has me trained in all of them.
                    old movies she likes. easy going - anything that comes on tv.
                    what's the fuss with attrition or resignation from the bank - the relevant person can tell more about the news right, it's that.
                            some bad decision with interests so it's the equity team.
                    I tell a lie which is human but not the ones that hurt others and expect others to be honest.
                    my concern of why bypassed parents - bangalore not that I stay but important for child nurturing she said.
                    expect to be working partner - yes, parents also.
                            parents want to marry.
                    love marriage short comings - why old marriages so powerful - so biases do help us 
                            but given sufficient time and observations and not getting swayed by instant emotions - it makes up for it.
                    realize that decision not based on instantaneous emotions but rational view - it is decision for life.
                    Punjabis always happy and make happy - but they drink - oh that's bad observation - generalization from a community of hardcore drinkers. 
                            #You have 1 less thing to worry and take our company for eg.

                            ?but there's a mistake here - material love is not substitute which it is normally treated but it is for sustenance actually ashram relationship is subservient to career.
                            ?I disagree cuz love aspect of all those relationships be it career.

                    I have witnessed myself doing F3 in browser (old habits die hard)Polity - When you know that you know GIT and others don't - created a separate project and sync that repo with the main one regularly.

                    If addressee not listening, then change the addressee.
                            change the level of discussion - you are not letting me speak.
                            your mental calibre is not so developed to understand it.

                            I love you streak - mother will say go do some work. Different ways of expression of love is important.

                    When sb wants a faceOff in group -
                            say yeah, yeah and move on. "We will take it up separately" after giving it a little time. 
                            this is not machine learning - be assertive in giving a response while not trying to justify that it is. Tell what we have done - any knower of ML would agree that it is.
                    give value to people - as if they are all in all. Sir, they will anyways come after you for this. It is fact!
                    More than answering the question - answer emotions - oh you showed email also - what i said "recently we developed" - don't say "what I said"
                    Meetings - Acknowledge other person's contribution
                            when you challenge his motion or go for faceoff or give premature conclusion - the other person may feel hurt and discouraged from contributing further.
                            solution is acknowledge its validness - its importance and limitations in big picture.
                            emphasize the end result as if that's what all matters and is bigger than all of us.
                            it is "we" who solved the problem - make the problem of "we" and not "me".
                    Complaint to 3rd party for extra time given for driving - next day gave lesser time - which is what is expected and thoughtful.
                            solution - when you complain against a person - you pose a threat to him - not on physical front but on VA front. Threat bringers are not liked.
                            solution should be in levels - tell him first, he doesn't listen; tell manager; and hence forth - whom would the post mortem report serve anyways.
                            there are levels of severeness actions to intimate the person as to where it is going.

                    Polity - world of perception
                        by that you mean - correct statement
                        make your voice heard - presence made known.
                        give resistence - it discourages people to take it for granted. and do it only if absolute needed. Eg - Ping no ticket return.
                        plan along needs and then bring in concerns for them to stretch and want let's do it in the release.
                        planning has untracked activities (be assertive) - tell concern and give a dose - if you can't do it in 1.5 months then you should not be in the same team.

                                OR come back later after eating rice - cuz they won't know if you swiped when you got the plate.
                        swipe made compulsory for dinner? stop swiping in lunch - write in register in lunch.
                        get additional "makes sense" bills (truck charges from orissa) for joining bonus
                        I won't allow studs without prerequisite course - solution he won't tally it 1 to 1.
                        SAP wouldn't say no to face - dinner swiping started, then swiping won't allow but can write in regiser (must) while saying it is not for emp

                In discussion, the fastest finger first helps a lot. 
                warning won't save, e1 knows that but once you make a wrong assertion, 7 has advantage of correcting it and gain points; even if you correct your mistake, the points are lost.
                giving frequent presentations, gives an impact of you being very proactive.
                speaking it head on - this is wrong. should be able to prove it.
                Mess with terrace dancing. Tit for Tat
                        what if they don't listen to you - what i can do? - tell that I will complain against you.
                        getting all fans and lights on for high electricity bill - punishment but intelligence to not do it - cuz cold war situation and target is highly evident.
                                who would have done it is also but obvious.
                don't involve into fight that's none of your business.

                        you will come to saturday - ok, just send it to me in email and I am complaining against you - sir, you also consider like i do.
                Either don't make mistake - if it is done, then don't say it explicitly - eg - Gift I brought for didi - already bad feeling may start that not for me; but by saying no bro - you reinforce it.
                I have gift voucher - send it on mail to me and jiju.
                When complaining prove that you are not bitching but are justified at doing what you are doing
                        I called twice - when? 1st call at 9 and it's 10 now (1 hr gap - justified)
                        this has happened twice - has your number changed?
                Even with friends, ensure that you explain your correctness away - even if casually.
                quote when things get done your way
                7 screaming and you also start screaming - means you also participated in the motion of arg - make 1 statement that emphatically hits the eye.
                        put the person in a situation where he would be forced to give a reply in your favor.
                all army people and others with their designations are respectable for they "are" or have become and the way they contribute - feel sorry if 7 hurt by casual remark.
                        respect may be for efforts they have put in past or are putting in present - power they hold, etc - for all of them they are respectable.
                Self deprecating jokes - biggies are coming. I thought you were talking about me.
                free space can be used so that other people plan accordingly to the available space.
                        also a little displacements to suit your needs - no1 picks battles for trifles but of course, it sours relationship and gives bad impression for sure.
                allow "boy" to exercise their things as long as it doesn't hurt, if it does, take the role of man and convince the boy to act mature.
                I have jatt blood - I can always go to half rate, even free for the sake of what I believe or want to do. No bandhan ain't stopping me from acting the way I want.
                surabhi dd - good args but labellism => not a psychology expert. Pride hurt will obviously not act the way you want. A little hurt helps but not personal attack.
                Surabhi dd gave gift to me of smartphone - a gift should be honored and not paid back
                similarly bling buy so 51K. so will start fd as reciprocation - narrative younger brother started fd not elder one. So receiver of gift should start it.
                not directly asking for service but talking about it - if other reveals he has access then you can consume it.
                        Eg - wanted to watch GOT so gave more information thereby seeking a possibility

                        I will place the cup in the basin (instead of directly saying I will leave) - then leave as you would saying ok I will leave (no impact!!)
                #Polity - Levels for water management
                        1st of all is it really a problem - are you gonna use it at all. Don't make arrangements for ensuring vacant space.
                        agreement (3 bottles per person) - can be of any size 2 litre bottle making 6 litres per person - more than per day need.
                                and cooling happens in 3-4 hours.
                        partition (cuz can't gang on a common resource);
                        addressing concerns can be on 
                                whatsapp (gives them time to think over it)
                                In person 1 to 1.
                                Call meeting of all to talk about the problem or concern you have been facing and tell the problem and propose a solution
                        even in worst case scenario you expose an existential problem which acts in your advantage - an excuse for bargain any time in future.
                #Polity
                        like cost function in regression.
                                in real world think of our behavior like a function which we regularize by penalizing a certain expression with disapproval - this maintains some sanity in the world.
                                this penalizing has to be frequently done.
                        my chapatti thrown away
                                what if I do the same to you (penalize), how would you feel.
                                        more severe step could be - you throw my something next time and see what I do to your thing 
                                                this is quite big penalizing and can affect relationship seriously
                                                counter response could be and I will also not remain silent - yes, you want fight not solution (bringing fight barbarity to sanity and labelling him as barbarian)
                                what's the end goal of it - inform me - don't decide on your own and take step.
                                shouldn't I be aware of the decision you are taking whimsically - this is not how togetherness works.
                                counter response - I will buy you chapatti - 2 responses possible 
                                        no! it's not about chapatti but bad gesture.
                                        yes, from your perspective you should but importantly you don't repeat such a thing.
                        Fridge usage (Hypothetical)
                                all occupied - we need to partition (narrative) 
                                        not really reqd w/o sth pressing cuz we also get affected
                                        is there no rearragnement that can solve it.
                                logical that hijacking places isn't ok - use slots that are needed - getting cold water happens in 2-3 hrs and we don't consume 2L bottles in 2 hrs.
                                        deviation of argument - I think we should involve 3rd guy in talk and see what he has to say in this. I find it objectionable.
                                then please be ok that I may move the bottles to fit a juice bottle.
                #Polity 
                        Be straight - I will broom and mop also - then what will you do (all of us gotta do right?)
                        give alternative - I also gotta call home so gotta start early - why don't you call now
                                escape reason - no man, things are planned around that.
                        Please change the date - yes, you told - I am telling again so that you don't take it lightly - Sir if you say I will do it immediately - ok, great.
                #Polity
                        Smartness - 7 uses water all the time. when kept filled and found empty when came back, that's a clear suspicion and is quotable at some time.
                                solution - confess that I used under some excuse that friends had come so was must but I will buy it for you. Result it can't be held against you and narrative isn't in your face.
                        Fridge - benefits of "dabaana" - fight on that is cheap but you always replace the things very easily.
                #Polity
                        Keeping control in your hands - key is always kept here - so when you don't want you can always place it somewhere else and they will need to communicate.
                        when you want something to be welcome somehow simulate high cost for situation without it and relatively lower cost with it. So, subconsciously audience will welcome it.
                        Muh di lahar behar hathaan di hadtal - claim that you can do something in polite manner but don't do it and if it's brought up - make an excuse.
                #Polity
                        attention to case in point - OData the end user can't use from UI but they can use postman kinda tools - well, along the lines of SOAP UI which end user could use.
                                in real life you want to do things programmatically and not manually making requests and firing them cuz making xml will be less comfortable than filling a UI.
                                the API we develop are precisely named as per their purpose - it is application interfacing with program.
                #Polity - carry out a task in a time that it will invite least resistance like inform them while they are going to office
                        but you may end up troubling them for the day if news is sensitive.
                #Polity
                        Going transcendental - talking to owner, talking to tenant finalizing on the details and telling the preview.
                        reading a message but not showing whatsapp message read and taking actions based on that information - pretending that I didn't read it and you were doing your regular thing.
                        Comparing who is more favorable - enlist the advantages of 1 over the other. Being able to enumerate - this is possible in silence.
                                I could argue how could you do it without informing me - solution decide the flow of discussion thru further talk.
                        Give illusion of control to the other person and pivot discussion flow to direction you want 
                                Eg - I told him we can't finalize until you talk with our other tenant so I gave him time on saturday.
                        bargain tactics - make something non-important for other person - hey, do you use both of the resources.
                                start high so that we can mutually find middle ground.
                        it is world of perception + manipulation
                        Confidence - unfounded can potentially get into trouble but reasonable ways of making assertions with truth value between 0 and 1 - more towards 1.
                        #Office - report bugs (gives visibility and is an actual correction and of course, takes lotta knowledge)
                        perception - receiving call it's important then "what yaar"
                #Polity
                        Littlefinger - very friendly in talking and dealings but e1 knows he is clever but no1 suspects him for undercurrents.
                        Assumption - I told him that none of us are leaving the room. Preparing the other already.
                        Kaan se baat nikaalna - this subconsciously prepares the other person for what's to come and avoids shocks. hits the other person when situation arrives.
                #Polity - talking low level details - may receive frowns from others.
                        Be verbose about the level at which you want the discussion to be
                                eg - is New CM relevant on the CM screen - well it is the same screen - yeah, I am asking semantically or functionally.
                        solution to micromanaging or manhandling
                                be faster than someone's words
                                choose an alternative with an excuse
                                choose an alternative without an excuse - ask him if he knows about it.
                                express another alternative verbally - eg - escape button also gets windows mode off in eBay college project.
                                correct the words that is offered.
                Polity - Sid, go inside and don't accept matters on surface - and start solving or addressing their problem yourself - verbally, delegation, yourself, etc.
                        even like rejecting it as a problem - cajjoling, pursuasion, 
                        a gentle ask - take few hours, revisit and check if these many PDs are really required
                                if revisit with same number then complain like so you have not made any change.
                        make big outta that - please drop mails to all these guys with the reason
                Polity
                        endless postpone (taal matol karna) - procrastinate indefinitely or timebound manner (will do in 2 months for some dang reason or state nothing)
                        muh di leher beher hatthan di hadtaal or carry on anyway - do what you are gonna but on face casual person.
                                eg - oh that's a small money for splitwise but do it anyway. Cleaning we will see but set up the situation anyway.
                        agreements different levels - 
                                not talked about it (talk about expectations)
                                talked with ambiguity (solution be crisp about expectations)
                                agreement breached (keep back ups, contingency plans or plan accordingly)
                        intuitions can be very deceptive - 
                                utensil levied on a person - he delibrately did that for political motivation but he had genuinely had that communication going for so long.
                                he talked about no cleaning service but was the first thing he did - well he had to get cleaning done and asked as sideline.

                        make the task appear difficult and then do it vs make the task appear easy and then take more time.

                        Speak Up but when not to 
                                talked about it but now different move, if you don't speak the course will continue
                                sth undesirable behavior must address it and come back to expectations and terms.
                                the message that speak up sends, if that's not desirable then maybe postpone.
                Polity
                        never tell seniors on their face they are wrong unless necessary - tell me if I am wrong the browser engine they took to the back end - the back end is all written in C.
                                you didn't correct him or stated what's wrong but have clarified how the framework is if they don't understand still we don't care.
                        Polity - It's an art to make someone enthused about acting in certain ways - you tell them they are slow these days and that's what you elicit and say they are very fast and lo, behold!
                        Polity
                                There is gradient Descent into what higher desires (laws) want from you vs face off when you don't agree with them.
                                        Eg - why did you lift the baby - cuz I wanted it, my mother. It is my right - too much intrusion. vs saying ok then I ain't ever lifting him. 
                                        Well, 1st stand should be first and 2nd can be fallback.
                                        Time delay is a cost - no afasos on the diwali day then come with a minor delay showing that it's not approved to disclose that information today.
                                        7 says some abhidhyeya problem - immediately solve it and say now that's not a problem or do something out of nowhere and make a claim.
                                                Eg - It's chill for the baby - I will turn-off the fan and close the room gate and now it should not be a problem.

                                                        this is like AI - decide on the steps so as to achieve the final goal of your [family ]ideology.
                                College - Hi bro. Oh hi bhai - give a narrative if still no response - kaafi mashgool lag rahe ho kisi algorithm ke thought mein. This gives them feeling of missing the train.
                                        also - give response from their side - like speaking from baby's behalf. Like hi X - cool? sab cool hi hote hain no need of asking.

                                keep changing the configuration without compromising on other person's interests or where with an explanation or workaround the other person's problems are solvable.
                                follow up - this implicitly puts pressure that they are being tracked - also not just informing them but putting pressure on how much should have been done by now.
                                        eustress - 1 day back - should have been done by today - solution be specific no by tomorrow you said.

                                one layer below discussions - talking about contracts, etc - but this is fallback quite low on the list.
                                In college day, I may have had a certain disagreements with some people but I really appreciated them for skill, aptitude, etc.
                Polity 
                        They have lots of habit of manipulation and narratives and extracting fun - gradient descent.
                        Actually no excuses - you have to cultivate all the necessary arts - cut the clutter and pay the price.
                        You bring the best outta yourself when you accept yourself. Accept that you are the genius kind and are not a lot of society driven guy.
                Polity - fault finding can be replaced by suggestions to make things better.
                Polity - questioning someone who is doing upsets the person a little bit cuz they already have an upper hand on the virtue of doing the work.
                        if you have questions, humbly ask rather than challenge. So that your attitude is not to challenge their position but to make overall things better.
                        Eg - Syami's driving being challenged enraged him and caused him to verbally attack me.
                        Eg - Roommate Akash asked if he added fruits then he should not to which he roughly replied he hasn't and it was bulk purchase "obviously" - junior speaking rough with you.
                                but your pursuit was right - just that every experience helps you get better and not even trying takes you nowhere.
                        Eg - Some time separated out for homely discussions and not asking someone and the spur of moment - getting things done in non-threatening way.
                Polity - Understate or overstate the facts to come to exact figure.
                        Oh! I had to wait for so long - it was only 1 bell you rang right - no 2.

                    VIT Stories -

                            chose to be bitten by bed bugs who make your life hell for Krishna but that also helped advance in KC.

                    Every story has a purpose - it can be your story or someone else's - story without purpose also allowed if there's sth compelling about it - jokes, experience or triggers some emotion in you or others.
                    When I convinced my physics professor that Distance to time graph for acceleration was correct and only mine.

                            foolish fights with extra milk sachet. rooms were 3 star and quite opulent but I liked really thinking about hardcore CS and making notes for TV BG and FRIENDS.
                            2nd phase when DOTNET mastery messing of net drug that ate up time and that also required inter-connection of all modules. Teachers were good but not enough.

                                    ECC for recreational activities - mountaineering by the side.
                    Siemens internal outbound - when I did xorbing, mountaineering, fast ladder climbing and sliding on the sky on wire, walking on the rope balancing your weight,

                            very good friend from b.tech there.
                    Outside disturbance well tackled ; 1 time when 7 bolted the door outside (probably cuz I didn't vote him); motivational talks when limits touching (he called it samadhi) by Anjani Jha.
                            very constructive discussions with the best of the performers like Anjani, Aneesh, a tall guy, 1 guy who believed how teaching should be (self paced)
                            roof sound - complaint for us - we asked them to come and listen from our house as well. it was one above.
                            bolted - told him to keep it open. New hobby - started swimming.
                    Discussion
                            Space Debris
                                    Why - missiles attack - my college friend had made 2-D anti-missile - this could be seen as 3-D version
                                    like 99, we were being tracked - live tracking of a place and ability to get rid of waste - deletion is also a power.
                                    wo satellites uda rahe hain - what are we doing at ByD - ham documents uda rahe hain.
                                    yahi to life hai - kabhi ticket solving, kabhi GDPR - ticket ki document create nahi ho raha; kabhi discussion ki document delete nahi ho raha.
                            Traffic system
                                    automatic ability to track speed - when you can locate an object and location - then comparing 2 snapshots you can tell speed so it's possible - not in India.
                                            in my previous company they made smart traffic lighting system - Pankaj proposed movable dividor is also a good option - I remember in Pune they used to do it but manually.
                                    too much eaten, my legs should be able to bear my weight. I am a human. put it as artifact in museum.
                                            those going by train can eat as much and use train time to relax.
                                            driving after this - at your own risk, man.
                                    traffic police caught me - you told a lie in goa outbound - no car I said and even place. once i got caught thrice - but should have shown receipt - no didn't know while bargaining with traffic police.
                                            many take a note of vehicles on notebook and put in the app.
                                            many signals broken shown in an app and cumulative paid when you are caught st.
                                            one bought from another and had to pay for previous owner.
                                            1 foaf broke a signal - didn't watch the signal - saw it, but didn't see you - traffic police let her go.
                            Buy vs rent
                                    property value shoots up, Rupee values falls so nth firm but over a period of time, your EMI "reduces", interest gets you income tax rebate and sell value will be high.
                                    land - some protection - many companies - can sell for a good value but at their mercy cuz they know your situation.
                                            govt takes then there is property value that govt puts on it and you get that plus some more - eg golden temple premise was broadened (udupi place that Sunil bought)
                                    bachelors of course rent but pankaj at aecs - no entry to kundalahalli needed and another bought - so renting will start instead of selling - you remain owner.
                                    Mumbai - 1 crore you will get jhopadpatti - as soon as permission, people break and build more floors on top - no free ground left.
                            X4 - by feb gotta give them SRM part - s.t very few effort on maintenance.
                                    they say by august sth produceable.
                            Venkatesh said all he got was paranthas in north - i said that's what was expected.
                            now a days so many options in snacks - in early school days, just dosa and we would be happy - very tasty sambhar btw.
                                    Pankaj said he would be bribed to eat chappattis with dosa.
                            Adventure places

                        Am I utilizing everything to its fullest? Softwares, technologies, system utilities?

                        Grammar is also used for parsing when parts of strings are to be grouped and action taken on group being found
                                Acceptors generally use sequential parse (finding states string passes thru to acceptance or not)
                                Using TOC in hardware or software- to decide how to parse.

                Preaching experience to M.Tech boys - 1 very argumentative but would like to have your number
                        no, I won't give. You have to show some sincerity - that pride spoilt the whole preaching that year. 
                        i thought of feeling sorry in front of him but his actions already made me feel sorry. Now, feeling in front will not give desirable impact.
                my relationship with room owners in jamshedpur was good even tuscle when cycle given to his child fell. 
                        I rebuked - he came to fight why someone didn't do sth - I don't have idea about it - then try to make an idea about it - 
                        Sir, you see I treat your child like my younger brother. If your younger brother asks for cycle again, you don't deny him, you say yes. 
                        But who will politely let him know that some behavior isn't up to the mark, we only will tell him, in a kind way. 
                        If he felt down with that I will personally talk to him and feel sorry although he is younger to me.
                        My purpose is not to make him feel sad but ensure I don't hesitate the next time he asks for a cycle.
                        Generally people in fight are not so much concerned about words and what but the state of the other person. 
                        When your specific chosen words betray that you are what is desirable - from even transcendental perspective, there is no issue.
                        I went to him the 2nd time I wanted to have my all certificates and expressed my gratitude for allowing us to stay and enabling us to create a culture where we uplifted ourselves.
                                asked about his sons whereabouts and congratulated him - he was very happy to meet me.
                                I can't tell what difference this place has made to me (can't say about others) so thank you. 
                                That thanks for heartfelt - I really didn't care how it would be taken.

                        Fridge - KWh Consumption for a year.
                                100-199 litres	358	 $118.14
                                200-299 litres	410	$135.30 = 200 Rs per month
                                300-399 litres	490	$161.70 = 238 per month
                                400-499 litres	495	$163.35 = 241 per month
                                500-599 litres	738	$243.54 = 359 per month
                                600-699 litres	1356	$447.48
                                75 + 259 + 485 + 5.85 * (u - 200) (can be thought of as amount that is given free to users consuming >=200)
                                Saving on electricity = labelValue * 5.85 per year
                                Find years required to compensate for the electricity expenditure for extra money you are paying for it.
                                2 star = 680 and 4 star = 580 means saving of 600 Rs on electricity per year. But you have to pay 6K more for 4 star
                                        Selling each 1 returns 2/3 of investment. Meaning difference at selling time would be 4K.
                                        meaning if you use fridge more than 4K/600 years = 6.6 years then you gained (assuming all feature sets same for the 2 pieces)
                                        And if sell this one, we will certainly buy another one, thus, going for bigger star is always desirable.
                                Buy best now vs Buy needful now and best later
                                        Comforts more and Moving expense (2K) vs sell off and buy this best one (worth / 3 for sell off)
                                        And model keep changing, features keeping adding, value for money keeps on increasing so better wait than rush.
                                        Not rent cuz gonna stay more than p months. Buy 2nd hand vs needful 1st hand. Selling off needful 1st hand will be easier.

                        If doesn't agree to concern, then redistribution of rent or switching of rooms are options. Think win-win. Pretense of talking melodious things and other doesn't laugh cuz game theory ain't addressed - there's something biting that person. Game theory is ultra-important concept in worldly relations.
                        If not even that, then we should consider other options around ourselves. Mind it - 500 extra, petrol may cost more - act in intelligence! Cure, or else endure happily.

                Don't mix Ds so much - there's D involving solving a problem; there's D involving social life - it desires problem solving but problem statement can always be changed.
                Not a lot of time should be spent on D cultivation, it's application is important.
                        Focus spending your time on D. If J is reqd, finish it off ASAP.
                        You don't do D cuz you presume that J is missing while others managed to explore system a little and come up with solutions.

                Escapism is when you don't want to accept the challenge at hand
                        Your all readings should center around how to get the challenge finished. Selective reading / hearing / asking in batches.
                        Allow yourself to think thru what could be happening.
                Making notes is a standardization and it takes time. It should be secondary to work at hand - cud be utility for it but never a substitute.
                        this standardization gives u an edge over others.
                        Idea is not to constrain your thinking to notes. Let notes assist your thinking, accelerate and add confidence.
                        Remember what Debjit said - where are you allowing yourself to imagine how it cud be happening. Where is stretching / gym for brain muscles - recall excitement, bet over recall.

                    Probability of accidents in world 
                    Let us suppose 5 friends got together and planned to contribute Rs 10000 every year and kept that amount in a locker and decided to use that amount when any of the 5 friends is in danger or needs money. They decided to give entire Rs 50000/- to him/her.
                    100 Rs from 1000 people giving you 1 lakhs for the year
                            1000Rs cover for situ for 100 ppl for it to remain profitable
                            Probability that ppl asking for cover will be less than 100 = P(1) + P(2) + ....
                    They can afford claims 
                    30 people gave 13K making up for 1 person's problem
                            P(Problem) <= 1/30.
                            Population of the city - how many people got hospitalized in a year in the city 10000, 100 got hospitalized
                            over 30 years in the city, a total of 1000 cases of hospitalization were registered - probability of hospitalization for a year!! no law of large number should be the way.
                            1000 people enrolled, P(300) = 
                            They expect that only 1/30 * 100 = 3.3% people are likely to reclaim full amount - OR 7% people will come up with a claim of half amount - make a normal curve.
                            Take records of expenses made in hospital and draw and curve to get idea of typical expenditures. Patients have no control over it!! But sample size may have people with humble backgrounds but hospitalization may not include poor ppl.
                            Find a person's probability of expense in a given range near mean - find expectation of expense to a person.
                            Total expense for a total of n visitors - e. average expense = e / n.
                            They expect that not more than 3-4 ppl will fall sick amongst selected 100 people - if they are going to consume all the amount.
                            but e/n is most likely expenditure -  they expect (believing in law of large numbers), that 
                                    1 person = 13K
                                    ? persons = e/n made up for 1 person
                                    1 Re = 1/13K
                                    e/n Rs = e/(13K.n) persons must participate 
                            Let's say typical expenditure in hospital is 40K - 40/13 persons = 3 persons can make up enough money to cure 1 man.
                            They believe that not more than 33% people will ask for claim - we are limited in hospitals
                                    what is the probability that of all slots will have all our registered ppl in there!!
                            Increase a little premium and give some free services like health check up - giving income to hospitals, ppl worth of investment and insurance continuum.
                            Cover is well defined so ppl won't go.
                            But it has to be lucrative enough for ppl to invest into
                                    What amount of premium is best - for reducing premium, customers are likely to increase - but %age that investment company gambles with also decreases.
                                    we can't afford to see more than 25% admissions!! 20% so on!! Trade-off at the best number that customer finds lucrative and our %age gamble is justified.

                                    The difference between PL and EL has nothing to do with "Govt. or Pvt. office".
                                    The difference is that under Factories Act such leaves are called Earned Leave (EL) and under Shops & Estb. Act the same are called Privilege Leave (PL). 
                                    Although the nature and purpose of both PL and EL are same, however, applicability differs in terms of minimum allotment, which is, 
                                            under Factories Act, 1 EL for every 20 days of work (18 per year)
                                            on the other hand under S&E Act 5 PL for every 4 months work (15 per year).

                    <CarBuyingDecision>
                            If this engine is running at 3,000rpm, that means that every piston in the engine can burn 500cc of fuel and air 3,000 times a minute. The more air and fuel an engine can burn, the more power it usually produces.
                            How does engine size affect performance?
                            As a larger engine is usually able to burn more fuel and produce more power than a smaller one, a car with a larger, more powerful engine is likely to be able to accelerate faster and tow heavier loads than a car with a smaller engine can manage.
                                    travel long distances on motorways with luggage
                                    fun while driving - more powerful and tend to make more noise
                                    cars that are large and heavy in their own right tend to require larger engines. Eg - Range Rover.
                                    most engines produced today that are bigger than 1.0-litre should be more than capable of coping with motorway drives.
                                            specific cc depends on factors.
                            With a larger engine able to burn more fuel with each revolution it turns in a minute (rpm), it’ll usually consume more fuel than a smaller engine would during the same journey.
                            save money on fuel vs get accelerations and power to lift heavy loads.
                            small engine on cruising - suffers more wear and tear - louder and less refined.
                            Diesel is more energy rich than petrol per litre and the differences in how diesel engines work make them more efficient than their petrol counterparts.
                                    but diesel cars are expensive. Are you a high mileage driver?
                                    diesel cars need regular runs on the motorway to stay in good condition. Not good for town driving.
                                    diesels produce more local pollutants like nitrous oxide,
                                    Petrol, on the other hand, is often better for smaller cars - hatchbacks, superminis.
                            2.0-litre engine will usually provide enough power to cruise at motorway speeds without drinking too much fuel.
                                    smaller if around town
                                    giant supercharged V8 engine might be perfect for trackdays but it’ll drink far too much fuel on the school run to make for a sensible family-car engine
                                    supermini powered by an efficient 1.0-litre unit could cost pennies to run but it’ll be useless if you plan to tow a heavy trailer.
                                    type of car you’re after and what you plan to use it for.
                                    most 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engines are more than enough to move a Volkswagen Golf-sized hatchback with four passengers and luggage, while 2.0-litre diesels are usually a great choice for anything from a hatchback to a large SUV, such as an Audi Q5.
                                            SUV gotta keep up with fast moving traffic so will need higher cc.
                                            compact car may feel nippy with 1 litre.
                                            school run and inner-city commutes - 1.4 litre does fine
                                            storming up and down motorways - 1.4 to 2.0 litres refined at higher speeds and extra punch in overtaking.
                                            pulling heavily laden trailers under towing limits > 2 litre.
                            Picking a larger engine doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll use more fuel. Smaller units often have to work hard to keep up a steady motorway cruise and may prove less economical than a larger, less strained engine as a result.
                            Turbocharging technology have made engines more powerful
                                    a turbocharged engine will produce approximately the same power as a naturally aspirated unit that’s 50 per cent larger.
                                    Ford’s latest 1.0-litre turbo EcoBoost three-cylinder has proved potent enough to replace the firm’s old 1.6-litre non-turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

                                            Eg - why not Ford Ecosport over Hyundai Creta - that is more value for money.

                                            2 doors, 1 row or a small seat at back, sportier than sedans but not a sport car.
                                            2nd row st for children or small baggage/luggage.
                                            Little faster and powerful cuz of lesser weight.
                                    Sports
                                            performance is most important here
                                            2 door car or like coupe.
                                            engines are high power on petrol for high output- high speeds (comfortable to handle)
                                            low cg for racing, high maintenance. Engine is at the rear.
                                            eg- audi r8.

                <MarriageCriteria>
                        As Juan Gallardo says, being in the same profession increases understanding between two people quite significantly. After all what is a marriage other than a commitment based on compatibility, empathy and  mutual need fulfilment? 
                        Being in the same profession helps you empathize with each other. However, other aspects like compatibility and mutual need fulfilment still need to be looked at very carefully before taking a decision.
                        You can't be happy with your own competitors
                        Marriage is an arrangement of co-habitation of man and woman which lays the foundation of the prime unit of a society. Marriage therefore is the most beautiful bond which unites two souls on their journey of life
                        scientists or engineers, it's definitely better because you can share ideas and mutually propel your profession.
                        business - double the social network you have, which is really beneficial
                        true love and emotional and physical compatibility is there
                        will got to know about their duty and schedule and work better than anyone else .And , it will help them to adjust properly .
                        the same thought process which I see at work place , at my dinner table too - the same thought process which I see at work place , at my dinner table too - learn 4m other sector as well
                        you have something to talk about - understand each other
                                pilot will definitely have trouble with a mechanic even if he is a plane mechanic.
                                jealous because he had to stay on the ground and I got to fly with my flying buddies as he called them.
                                pilot buddy - happy conversations
                        shared common values & morals (work/family/fun). Secondly it's about personality traits that get along. That is what makes better relationships 
                        interests, religious outlook, opinion about children, income, future outlook, personality, and willingness to eat meat.
                        understand each other better, thus higher communication & empathy
                        same soul and goals - hobbies be alike
                        understanding the stressors and benefits of said career
                        firm boundaries regarding work at home and work conversation else work becomes 24 X 7 focus
                        rule of no work discussion for half an hour - then debrief each other then move to household.
                        Yes - share more in common, more mutual friends. More things to talk about. More compatible goals.

                        Caste
                        Meeting indian in UK - immedate bon - understand your culture and way of life 
                        traditional reasons - ruled out by technology development
                                cultural shock - food habits, dressing sense, way of talking, way of socializing
                                occupational hierarchy - higher level in this occupational hierarchy will obviously see this as a threat to their livelihood
                        Current day reasons
                                Societal factors - izzat or what society thinks
                                Stereotypism - stigma of traditional occupation; Brahmin- then its like saying its my culture and purity will be compromised
                        accommodate with our tradition, khatri says below us; others - people hate for reservation or stuff.
                                Same Beliefs
                                Same Customs
                                Same GOD
                                Same Society
                                Some Same Relatives
                        Implication of all this was that if in Community a person calls 'A' a A then person from same community will understand it as 'A'. 
                        Person from different community may understand it as 'B' or 'C' or 'A' etc.. - huge confusion and needs more talent.. 
                        Hindu society marriage is social responsibility, not personal need - raising a healthy, well behaved, kind and generous children
                        financial background be similar

                        Inter-state
                                Language: The couple may not know the local language spoken at the spouse’s home, which may be a barrier to understand other people’s talks.
                                Food: Every part of our country has its own local dishes and its own style of cooking. The food being served at one place may not be liked by person at another place.
                                Customs and traditions: These form an integral part of our culture, which again differ from one place to another. One should respect his/ her spouse’ culture and traditions also besides practising his / her own set of rituals.
                                Only love and understanding between the couple and family can help the couple overcome these barriers so that they can gel well with each other’s families.
                        festivals are different, language is different, food is different etc.
                        problem of distance - flights, 
                        may eat different foods but adjusting to a different lifestyle may be an ask.

                                my pursuits, gratifications, constructive entertainments, customer, learning social philosophy and stuff.
                                Marriage is mainly an interface which we want service from - anyone implementing that interface is welcome to serve it.
                                        what's the price of that service - the other person comes with their NIC - there is should mutual fulfillment (purak)
                                        with the presence of other person - there come some factors like your visions (gratifications on all the layers should not be hampered (concern), maintained (need), grow (intererst)
                                        even with those visions some are really important like spirituality - there should be a great deal of commonality.
                                        intellectual gratification has its corresponding mental needs (EQ - like excitement on sth CS) - that should meet NIC.
                                        there will be a great deal of fun with commonality (and necessary differences); great deal of seriousness (with interfaces being served)
                                I have a let go attitude which is good but at right place it's a power, wrong place, it's MOI.
                                Exposing -ve side ain't just an excavation  - you should reveal your negatives for a more conscious call - the interface agreement is serious for both the parties - let it be mutually rewarding with truths not hidden.
                                        where is you are is more important than the path you traversed to get here.
                                there are so many cheaters out there that genuine person is hearwarming. Don't miss 'em.
                                Flash can't be a basis of marriage - cuz on sight you see only by senses and with experiences, it's with the mind that we observe.
                                        intellectual gratification ain't the basis of relp (company is) - but its necessary EQ for IQ should be served well.
                                Transgressing your boundaries is such a risk in arranged marriage - 7 gets serious with those jokes and then no breaks the heart - your flexibility to say no - should not be lost.
                                Problem of input space - space reduces with the age - we put in filters for our customized mental gratification on interfacing object - there are fake profiles, so good interviewer reqd.
                                        those profiles ain't static - they are also searching for their requirements - it's mutual.
                                +ve in first, heart to reveal -ve in second - but ideal is sandwich formula of +-+.
                        ye yatha maam prapadyante
                                the space for favor and its reciprocation is determined by you.
                                Favor is defined when it is given in the space that you expect and that has to be reciprocated - with Krishna, the whole universe is his space.
                        1st meeting suggestions
                                how good your family is reveal - you stand to reward (the interfacing object is my best bet)
                                feminism important in family - career importance

                                mental > physical - mental you can do sth about - height can she grow it.
                                give case study - 
                                rate how good a person you are - those who hurt others know it already. on scale of 10.
                                how often you get angry, last time you got angry - patience rating
                                Teva is important for us
                                what all matters to you make a list and rate her on scale in those things - whatever gets measured gets managed.
                                how comfortable are you in joint family - does your father get angry - what does he get angry over - the tendencies may surface.
                                dress doesn't make it modern, attitude does.

                                Jee Aaniyaan nu - attitude is always charming and attitude and charisma anyways guarrantee attraction but should not be the sole basis of relp - what about willingness in tough times.
                                how aggressive are you with your career.
                                Studying in KV - compromise or glorious - celebrate the facts.

                                If you come home, you're the luckiest person - interview to ensure there are no surprises - in few interviews you can't get complete picture but trailer itself tells a lot about movie. Also the attitudes are revealed.
                                e1 willing to help in your family - 1 person engaged, others help for cooking - sacrificing nature not compromising one. serving nature.
                                Family - no anger, no grudge, no hurting 7 - e1 gets algon to help a person with grudge.

                                Silence is an art vs bubbling with ideas - who breaks silence.
                                Dress, yoga, +/-, you already sweet, eyes in love; company hopper, but not others, same distance willing to drop her.
                                was it about jokes or knowing the other person.

                                sentimentalism  is guaranteed in a relp but if you have invovement with other seers (separate from emotions) thru discussions that helps.
                                        like family, then more ideas and rationale is returned.
                                no response for whatsapp messages (loking desperate vs standardizing the standard things)
                                        handle it with maturity - can't force another person to behave as you want her - but mutually decide what is the center of attraction and how intense they want to get intimate.
                                        this is what they call as being needy or being desperate.

                                sandwich style meetins all of them. - all relp / allies ask "why are you together" - tell vision -> backlog -> the only criteria of friendship - center of attraction all of serious abt.
                                Einstein was amazing but fellow professors were not jackasses - the sources that inspired him

                                        you are famous in company or stand out as neewton cuz of your contributions
                                        break the silence in meeting with powerful points. They can't ignore their profits - or do that at your own risk.
                        Get a habit of seeing Krishna in past - with present and future - make sure the tendency doesn't make you irresponsible.
                                Seeing Krishna in present means that if this circumstance is orchestrated for my well being (not mental gratification), 
                                        what is the opportunity here to grow (in all the layers).
                                        How should I have behaved - eg - I escaped the confrontation because I wanted to be Mr nice guy - at least bring to the knowledge of the guy that he was dishonest.
                                Seeing Krishna in past means gratitude (don't force it - see if you feel so)
                                seeing Krishna in future means hopeful or expecting - but this ain't atheistic. So, think excited.
                                I am atheist at expecting it from Krishna. So, I don't criticize him for shit - that's the nature of jivas, etc.

                                    you are looking for 100% of eth - no, I am looking for cluster - worst case 7 pulls you down and best case 7 lifts you up. realistically, it should be mutual upliftment cuz at least the value system is there - even if state can be like 7/10 but we value 10/10.

                                Unavailable - no call pick during day in evening busy most of the times, delayed whatsapp response. => No stomach butterflies.
                                        let's spend 2 more hours talking - no, I am busy with something (lies again!)
                                        I can talk if you can - I don't have strength to talk.
                                        Patience is important!! Assume you know until you prove me wrong but we don't doubt the other person.

                                sudden conversation stops - serious - ok bye, let's not meet then, I don't want to talk, important discussion but m sleepy
                                        unwillingness to solve existing problems - other person's concerns not addressed - we need to talk about it - I am not in mood. Lack resilience.
                                Misrespect (or doesn't care mindset) for family members - I gave her reason I don't know wo samjhi ya nahi samjhi. snapshot as proof. No call receiving from parents (you forgot)
                                        dare to apologize with them with call specifically made unto them.
                                Poverty mindset - if not this, then what else do I have at moment. @car analogy.
                                        is worried about divorce - talked about it 2 times. These days people do - what do you think about lifetime commitment.
                                        Too accepting - that's ok with me. Video games I will play. Not picking call is serious - it is.
                                unfirm - I didn't like last meeting then books tickets for family.
                                Lies - I am sick suddenly (if so, why didn't tell me and why working on saturday again), I was shocked to hear about Dusshera meeting but to sister b4, "you also coming?".
                                        I didn't read the message - later confesses I read them but didn't have time to respond.
                                        manipulative mentality is plain darn No No.
                                I hate medicines.
                                Many Swearing words cuz of her - realizing the fallacies of arranged marriage Model - meet 1-2 times and decide (no opportunity only to say No)
                                No bank accounts will be separate. I must have dogs. Rejected previous ppl cuz of honeymoon asking, were getting too involved with life.
                                Uses your things against you - "you think so much". Not as concern but informing that it's a problem about you.
                                High Maintenance you are - difficult to handle the trailer how will we handle the movie.

                                Time spent is good - when we meet cuz she laughs on my jokes and is responsive.
                                puts conditions - means she isn't needy (needy people have high probability of having shortcomings which brought them to that state)
                                Has genuine fears - Is it not too fast? I felt little awkward last time.
                                truth - I am normal person and you are too intel.
                                hard working but not intrinsically driven for hard work - evening mein self driven ticket solving.

                                Happy when come home, no manipulative, you can't even touch sister.
                                It is possible to change details but core values and beliefs which manifest themselves in nature behind certain actions are difficult (require more effort) to change.
                        Pratima - where we are standing - 
                                why did you book tickets without consulting me - she was center of attraction and others based their tickets on this.
                                        e1 was hurt cuz she was not involved in the process - how could I forget? I made a point to parents but that ain't enough - I have to take it till completion.
                                that's fine if we part ways - later on, I don't know what to do.
                                        yes, that should be perfectly ok but let's not take decision in rush that we regret why we said no so early, be clear about its repercussions.
                                By Seedhi Saadi, you meant you are manipulative? - yes was the first response (first response means sth)
                                        no, I meant that many small goals to pursue in life (what's seedha saadagi in that!!)
                                        SAY IT - it won't work with me. If you are manipulative with parents - we are one, I won't permit that in life!! Jhoot fareb nahi chal sakta.
                                        if you can change that we can go on - when we come home, happy time and if you can't deliver or are manipulative, it can't go on (instead of using divorse word)
                                                if you not happy or are sick, tell me upfront - don't hide - don't lie - if manipulative, you gotta change else it's big problem cuz it can't be happy life.
                                                cuz lies get exposed today or tomorrow. for happy, I will work in that direction and expect the same - if you can deliver, we move ahead else deny it upfront.
                                                no response isn't an option - do you have time with yourself.
                                        divorce isn't a no option !? Rather, unhappy life isn't an option!! I want happy marriage - no hiding, no lying and I keep her very happy and vv.
                                        just expect respectful attitude towards my family.
                                in arranged marriage you get less time but more focus - then find yourself - yeah, I should but my problem that I am slow in such thangs.
                                to some degree you believe and to some degree you verify but not too much - you accept the other person - 
                                        Don't wrong me - I am a simple person - I believe what you say until I get a counter example. And that's when you think, if you are right about other assumptions.
                                still unwilling to reveal what she does on weekends - 
                                        that's my personal life and if I am entering in your personal life and I can't get details on your personal life then I am not a valid candidate for your personal space.
                                        what have you told me - as much as possible - nevertheless, ask me now, tell me if I deny to answer any question - I am open book.
                                that's why I said you think too much - I really like that aspect about me - do you?
                                        it's a scientific approach you are free to make any postulate but you put it through test.
                                        if free discussion ain't possible then there is no possibility to tell if you are different places and don't share the same ground.
                                If I am hurt by something and you are not hurt by it or do not seek to resolve it, we can't be together right now.
                                Do you feel butterflies? I will tell you tomorrow. You are dangling!!!
                                Are you marrying me or what I have? 
                                        Obviously in material world, it's what you have, always but point is, conditions (also values and beliefs) from both sides are being met (conditional love)
                                        it may be conditional but you do offer and feel love - that's (though sth to cherish) to be tolerated but done.
                                        It's like money in world - that's not the trigger for work for a spiritualist but can be an excellent motivator.
                                you are repeating those statements, that means they are to be emphasized, see if you like this aspect about my personality as well.
                                        things are opening up more and more with time. Let's not keep our parents dangling - they get involved and then get hurt.
                                        hamara kya hai hum to fakir aadmi hain jhola utha ke chal padenge dusri ladki se milne.
                                                although it's a good joke - it can be misunderstood that you are not important to me but my apologizing and calling proves that it was a joke.
                                can't talk right now cuz I want to see your expressions - you are in different mood when face to face cuz you wanna have good time. 
                                        Driven by senti and not rational - cuz you don't want things to suck.
                                My only concern was if I wronged her - well, it's always possible but while doing them you are thinking they are right as per your experience.
                                        Krishna uses your conditionings to direct you to your karma or his desire.
                                        Important is if you realize that you did - then you are willing to apologize but don't do that too much - you look silly that way.
                                        I didn't - rather she did - I had to seek clarification - leakage of alleges is possible (in pursuit of making it decorative language)
                                                felt happy that she willing to apologize but later refused that as mistake.
                                                I was pacified when I heard the reasons - even expressed that some of my concerns are addressed 
                                                but looks like that was an opportunity for her or she gets pissed too much over such issues - no endurance for problem solving as I said.
                                                that too you put an abrupt stop on proceedings and not systematic closure of file/project.
                                1 way of cracking jokes or seeing a thing is drawing parallels between business and enjoyment life (I purposely didn't call it love life)
                        More
                                My tone was of alleging as if she is all of those negatives and not seeking clarifications for them. That makes a person feel wronged.
                                        look at your tone - there is so much negativity in it.
                                        tolerate - compromises in relp. I didn't like when you would not pick phone but I accepted. Alongside it is.
                                pre-marriage discussions is a trailer of what's to come. If you part ways over something, you would think of divorse in that situation.
                                Maturity means listening to e1 without getting influenced while seeing only the factual concern involved. Like Prime Minister.
                                        immaturity means being reactive - iow driven by emotions and not intellect. Any set of emotions involved is just inputs for intellect to decide.
                                        called her when I was under the influence of emotions and was in attack mode.
                                I just put my conditions and was less sensitive to her conditions. Making her feel loved was also important, rather more important.
                        Love in world
                                Let go of eth in life - eth was just nothing nw - there's no endurance for that.
                                given a situation you will tend to do that - used that too supreme controller's plan.
                                Love is conditional - if they are misunderstood, your love makes you feel unreciprocated.
                                Love in this world is a utility, not a goal - it doesn't last for anyone.
                        why compromise, if trailer was not appealing independently, I am already positive.
                                why jabardasti. But discipline father and blr girl.
                                whatever god does is for our good. coming events cast their shadows before - things are not moving as expected.
                                relaxed hoke karo - koi pressure mein nahi. why wait for years, why delay when it can be done in month - acchi, suitable, khandani, etc.
                                i didn't say sham tak koi kudi labni hai. when ego is hurt, then they protest - even kid does - nth has for ego but feels.
                                1 side story can't be basis of conclusion. Social relations are sensitive - love is feelings - heart, head, eyes all guided in that direction.
                                        enmity is aankhein pher lena - the same eyes that showed love, now express enmity.
                                        when I am liking being there, why should I be there in discussion - being straight forward is right.
                                        talk to be conveyed are to be done with confidence - so that the other person doesn't mind - problem should be told but with tactics.
                                        what is problem for us - ain't a problem for her - there comes differences and can't proceed further.
                                the other person doesn't tolerate - now she has no endurance - doesn't even accept as mistake - we are saved from future.
                                either don't take step - if taken, then be firm on it and accept the consequences.
                                you can't adjust everyone according to you. see best bet - poverty mindset ain't not good.
                                we are simple people - we take you for your words - but counter eg we gotta think if we are right at other things.
                                if in the beginning such small things create problem - think about future.
                                In today's world sorry doesn't mean you are great but you are weak (don't say it over and again)
                                        chowdhary hoke baitho we are not needy. It was over from us b4 - if you are angry we are more.
                                        I have to elicit No from her - sahi time par faisla hua hai.
                                        if you would have come, then flexibility of saying No is impossible.
                                Relax khao piyo maujan karo - I am with you.
                                We feel hurt to the extent that we invest in love and that love fails to reciprocate or stand up to it.
                                        but doesn't mean that we stop trying - it is a need to address. Spirituality can saturate you but in initial stage, it can at least offer you stability.
                                        don't stop acting because it's effort - so be it - so is career, health, etc - so should be spirituality.
                                Love not in mental layer - take feelings - songs only for enjoyment
                                        love interface is meant to be served by God not anything material. Think about it.
                                should have many friends - many replacements - else overly dependence on 1 person - never.
                                        it was family that absolved me of my kaun-maun.
                                Wife is an extension - is interfaceable - you ask her => you ask yourself. 7 chastises her => 7 chastises you. So is true with family.
                                        that's oneness we are talking about.
                                Smart - e1 is in current day and age. But good profile. I enjoy their fights 7 exclaims means that they have time for shit, they are idle.
                                Dinner time but not for people important in life - manipulative and selfish.
                                attitude - future oriented, life, family oriented, etc.
                                Time exposes e1 - so that way love marriages take an upper hand - maybe astrology has different plans if you believe in it [thru time] - that's fine => keep options.
                                Muh mein haan but zahan mein rakhna that there is no mistake in non-responsiveness - that's dangerous for life especially when you don't keep diverce as option.
                                        getting to know things in time is fortune and not that things didn't work out - forcefully making things work out ignoring problems is a nightmare.
                                Possible root cause - fear of spirituality, too much of intellectual talks in mental realm, mentally not involved or ready in the process, too much hurt by small things.
                                        no endurance is a problem anyway. 
                                        A day b4 felt she could cry but that's not having endurance - we gotta solve problems together and not that I seek no clarifications and am mindless dog.
                                        why should I tell personal life - that's personal to me. Why should I tell what I do at night - who are you to me? no1 but we are hoping to take it sw ain't we.
                                Krishna is an artist - he performs multiple things in 1 shot
                                        she is not meant for you - I asked Krishna for doing the needful in prayer.
                                        it will be an experience for future - better choices next time.
                                        it clarifies lots of your concepts regarding marriage models and EQ realm.
                                        you witness shortcomings of worldly love and also its importance - let's call it enjoyment life and not love life.
                                        you had karma of ignoring calls of family members awaiting - got delivered.
                                        Krishna knows what hurts you so that he gives you precisely what you hate.
                                                so that you don't get too emotionally involved so that when it's a no - you are not out of your mind.
                                        ending a love feels like or gives a snapshot of what death is like when all worldly loves are gone.
                                                American Beauty - I could complain. What life was about? And I tell myself to relax and let go.
                                                Death Note - Dedicated your life to it and now, it's time - all this while it was Interesting.

                                        Overstepping Boundaries (personal invasion)
                                                try and change their partner - fashion sense or their fundamental beliefs - angry, disrespected, hurt.
                                                stomps on the very idea of mutual respect - leads to retaliation or withdrawal
                                                draw the line when it comes to pushing for change - cuz st unintentional and st as a goodwill.
                                                Q - what if I am doing sth terrible wrong to you? or wrong as is known to the world.

                                                A - convince the other person that it's bad for them and let them evolve thru it.
                                                        sth objectionable should be told upfront - like I st end up watching so naughty stuffs on web and biology takes over.

                                        Lacking Complete Communication
                                                Talking is about giving information without the need of a response; room for complaining and criticism
                                                Communication, however, is a verbal and nonverbal exchange of information that requires a response

                                                less patient more irritated - pick fights with their partner about unrelated things

                        What ain't love
                                flying high - Love is reality. It has peaks, sure — it shouldn’t be ugly — but love is really in the valleys.
                                        shit hits the fan? love is neither fight nor flight; love doubles-down, joins forces, makes it work
                                feelings makes for immature, volatile relationships; susceptible to one day “not feeling it” and folding
                                        Love is a choice, an active decision, and a series of investments and efforts and actions.
                                        “Infatuation,” “preoccupation,” “obsession” or “can’t live without.”
                                Companionship
                                        Partners are not here to keep us entertained, or distracted, or protect us from feeling lonely — or staring down the barrel of old age.
                                don’t share your lows
                                        does the low invoke a strong emotion or is it an information for them
                                don’t want to move with them
                                        move across the country (or the world) and you are in no way inclined to follow 
                                makes sacrifices for the others’ comfort
                                        pleasure they give can't be foundation of love - it is only expression of it.
                                Mature love is based on healthy non-attachment
                                when it aligns in the right way, it feels really good. But when it doesn’t, and they claim more of you than you offered or chose, it’s awkward
                                Fear and love can’t coexist. If your primary anxiety around the idea of breaking up is “fear of being alone,” it isn’t love.
                                Then what IS love?
                                        Embracing each other as individual human beings with individual human being lives, who just happen to get along enough to bump down the road alongside one another.
                                        Then, mutual investment and support in each other’s growth, especially when things get rough or scary. But always complementary, never to complete one another. And always with care and compassion.
                                        Choice.
                                        Action.
                                        Investment.
                                Love is deliberate, and we are active players. Attraction and infatuation may be something we “fall into” against our will, 
                                        but mature and healthy love is something we consciously build.
                        Stages of Love
                                Stage 1: Falling in love
                                Stage 2: Becoming a couple
                                Stage 3: Dealing with disillusionment
                                        old adage, "When you’re going through hell, don’t stop." 
                                Stage 4: Create real and lasting love
                                        learned to be allies in helping each other understand and heal our wounds - love and laughter flows against
                                        hurtful behavior is not because you are mean and unloving, but because you have been wounded in the past and the past still lives with you.
                                        As we better understand and accept our partner, we can learn to love ourselves ever more deeply.
                                Stage 5: Use the power of two to change the world
                        Test not on jnana but on dhyan - giving puzzles or real life situations to deal with. what do you like - teddy bear - if i hide it as prank, how you behave?

                        She like intellectual discussions of DS but puja she is ok with - feels good.
                        Let's maintain ourselves rational throughout this process - because emotional investment then we feel hurt - let's actually look for compatibility.
                                Eg - with drinks, smoking, meet eating, etc.
                        took advantage when I said age is a factor - yes it must be age for you - no it is not I said.
                                I said career important to me - recently reflected if marriage is even important - stability - her point was 7 to be with.

                        free not in weekdays - work is very important to you - yes it is (subconsciously conveys that she is not interested in work per se but the rewards)
                        don't judge - but evaluate for compatibility.
                        very obedient - 15-20 baar to parents hi nahi manenge. Love marriage is also good but people are generally not focussed and get driven by feelings.

                                        current weight, etc.

                                medium-firm memory foam mattresses are perfect for those suffering back pain. Memory Foam contours the entire body without any gaps unlike innerspring mattresses.

                                Memory foam mattresses outperform latex mattresses in all tests which measure comfort, like proper blood circulation. Pressure point relief is a clear sign of comfort. A memory foam mattress offers your body the best sleep surface on the market, with better blood circulation and contouring support being big pluses

                        Sleeping on the wrong mattress can cause or worsen lower back pain. Lack of support from a mattress reinforces poor sleeping posture, strains muscles and does not help keep the spine in alignment, all of which contribute to low back pain
                        Look for one that is not too firm or too soft. If the mattress is too firm, it will push on your pressure points and cause misalignment. Similarly, if the bed is too soft, it will allow your body to sink into the bed causing bad posture while you sleep, which can then lead to pain.
                Misc
                        Ask about comfort guarantees or trial periods before you buy. ...
                        Side sleepers are most comfortable on a soft mattress. Latex memory foam and memory gel foam mattresses tend to work best for side sleepers. Stomach sleepers are most comfortable on a firm mattress. Latex memory foam and memory gel foam mattresses are usually best for stomach sleepers
                        HR mattress gives bounce but memory foam gives soft cushion - generally former used as a base.

                Thickness
                        The comfort and support ia same in all 5 and 6 inches. The height of mattress should be based on 2 factors.. 
                        (1). The height of cot plus mattress put together should be comfortable enough for someone to get on or off from bed. 
                        (2). Life of the mattress increases with increase in thickness of mattress. 
                The major difference is the top 2 inch thick layer in the mattresses. In dual comfort we use 32 density HR foam and in orthopedic one we use 65 density memory foam. In terms of comfort and support, ortho one is better than dual one. 
                And, memory foam mattress is medium firm mattress. 
                We recommend memory foam mattress for purchase. 
                Blanket
                        Blanket is also used to stay warm, but it is usually a single layer bed covering made from woolen material.
                        These are thicker than bed sheets, but not like quilts. 
                                Comforter is also a thick bed spread like quilt. 
                                The differences between quilt and comforter are the fabric, patterns and stuffing.
                        Fleece
                                Polar fleece is a soft napped insulating fabric made from polyester.
                                generally more inexpensive than wool, so the same warmth can be attained at a reasonable price! It is a very durable fabric because it is made up of Polyethylene terephthalate, more commonly known as PET
                        Air is trapped in the space between two thin blankets. Since air is an insulator of heat, it prevents the escape of body heat. That is why two thin blankets are usually warmer than one thick blanket.

                        Fibreboard
                                Fibre board is an inexpensive manufactured wood made from the breaking down of hard or soft woods into fibres which are then bonded together with wax, resin and heat to create a dense piece of wood.
                                One of the most popular fibre boards is MDF - constructed of medium density fibres that are known for their strength and durability and lend themselves ideally to furniture products.
                        MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard)
                                MDF is very strong and is considerably more popular than people think. In-fact many will be surprised as to how much MDF furniture is around them.
                                With its strong/dense structure, your furniture is likely to last a lot longer than you expect, however it’s no solid wood, but it’s a fraction of the price of solid wood. MDF is extremely popular with Ikea, another leading furniture retailer.
                                In the majority of cases, furniture built with MDF will have a wooden veneer bonded to it to give it an expensive looking finishing touch.
                        Plywood
                                Plywood is a very strong manufactured wood as it is build-up of layers of wood veneers which are bonded together to create a flat smooth sheet of wood.
                                It is popular in the furniture and flooring industries due to its inherent strength and resistance to warping due to the bonded cross-ply construction.
                        Particle Board (Chipboard)
                                Chipboard is a manufactured wood, made from wood chips and shavings that are bonded together with resin.
                                Chipboard is extremely popular when making furniture, especially Ikea furniture. 
                                It is a dense wood and is commonly used with a veneered surface which is used for flat-packed furniture and work surfaces.
                        Veneer
                                A veneer refers to a thin layer of wood which is cut from the circumference of a tree. It is then bonded onto a dense piece of wood, which is typically MDF, chipboard or plywood. Veneers are available in many sizes, ranging from 3 to 6mm thick.
                                Many people mistakenly assume that veneered furniture is cheaper than solid wood; however, veneers quite often are used in high end furniture pieces and it can be more costly than solid wood.
                                The way to find out if your piece of furniture is veneered is by looking at the edges, and checking if the grain lines run off the top and over the edges of the wood. As a veneer is real wood, it will accept stains and finishes much like solid wood.

                The carburetor contains jets that will push the gas into the combustion chambers. ... So with a carburetor, the best fuel to air ratio for each cylinder is approximated for the best performance. However, carburetors do last longer than fuel injection systems and are favored in motor sports
                Belts can't wrap as tightly as chains so they need to be run on big pulleys that wouldn't necessarily fit on smaller bikes. And when it comes to replacing a drive belt, the process usually entails removing the swingarm. Belts also sap a lot more power than sprockets and chains, so they're not nearly as efficient
                Diesel engines are more powerful than petrol engines. They also have a higher torque and hence they give a smoother drive. On the other hand, the harshness, noise, and vibrations in diesel driven cars are way higher than that of a petrol-driven car. The maintenance cost of diesel cars is higher than petrol cars.
                        Financial: diesel engines are more efficient and use 15−20% less fuel. The cars tend to have a slightly higher resale value. ... Economy: diesel's greater efficiency means its CO2 emissions are 20% lower than petrol.
                        Diesel engines may require more frequent oil changes and fuel filter changes than gasoline models, and some diesels may also require periodic replenishing of diesel exhaust fluid (urea), which reduces emissions of nitrous oxide. For the most part, though, diesels follow the same maintenance schedule as gas engines
                Engine Displacement
                        What they measure is the volume of the cylinders in a motorcycle's engine. This is also called engine displacement.
                        Generally speaking, the CCs affect the power and smoothness of your ride, but are not necessarily a measurement of power
                Digital Twin Spark ignition engine has two Spark plugs located at opposite ends of the combustion chamber and hence fast and efficient combustion is obtained
                        fuel efficiency and lower emissions, no overheating.
                        Less Vibration and noise
                        Long life of the engine parts such as piston rings and valve stem.
                        Thermal efficiency - better starting of engine even in winter - cuz inc compression ratio
                        instantaneous burning of fuel - more force exerted - better work output
                motorcycle tends to sacrifice fuel efficiency for higher CCs, as larger cylinders will deplete the amount of gas in the bike faster.
                horsepower and torque are truer indicators of power as they determine how quickly a motorcycle can accelerate
                power-to-weight ratio, which measures a motorcycle's horsepower 
                Torque is how strong your engine is and Horsepower is a measure of how fast it can use that power.
                HP = Torque * RPM / 5252.
                Both cars with same torque can pull a fair amount of weight, but only high horsepower can do so quickly.
                average torque that the piston delivers during the revolution stroke. More cyliinders add up the torque
                gearbox transmits the rotation of the crank onto (ultimately) the wheels
                power tells how fast work can be done - eg stairs
                The faster your engine turns from rest, the greater the torque is applied, and so has greater HP. This applies only up to a point. As engine speed increases the torque will begin to drop off. Its HP output will become less efficient with further speed increases.
                Bore or cylinder bore is a part of a piston engine. The bore also represents the size, in terms of diameter, of the cylinder in which a piston travels
                        value of a cylinders bore, and stroke, is used to establish the displacement of an engine

                Gravity Based, UV (Ultraviolet) and UF (Ultrafiltration) are great in removing bacterium, virus and dust. But, these type of cartridges and filters can not remove the dissolved salts in the water.
                        budget friendly one's that are suitable for water having low TDS levels (low Total Dissolved Salt)
                        Remove bacteria, protozoa, cysts and any turbidity in water.
                        can't Remove viruses, heavy metal or chemical content in your water
                        can't Reduce TDS level in water, i.e make hard water soft(TDS>500 mg/L is hard water)

                                Microfiber mesh / pre filter - remove larger particles / physical impurities from water like paper , hair , sand , dust , mud 
                                Activated Carbon trap - removes the chemical impurities and smell 
                                Germikill kit / kitanu magnet - chlorine based filter which helps to trap the most Bacterias n some viruses
                                Polisher / Post carbon filter - not necessary but crystal clarity.
                Local RO water purifiers remove Natural Minerals along with the Bad Hard Metals.
                        So, go for RO + TDS
                        can remove Heavy Metals, Pesticides, Arsenic, Flouride, Cadmium and other toxic dissolved salts
                        can remove bacteria
                UV
                        can kill bacteria, etc - but they remain in water.
                        water should be clear (not turbid)

                                    Am I gonna stay less than that? Rent : Buy;
                            Buy
                                    Be conscious of factors that apply and Be precise about your expectations for comfort
                                    Figure out factors that affect the rate
                                    Find the best trade off
                                    Include other factors like durability, transport, moving later.
                            Second hand
                                    When you know it ain't final stop (not enough for "No" to 1st hand)
                                    you just want a feel 4 it or experimentation
                                    It's quality (mensuration of factors that matter) is obviously not at its best- and you don't mind it.
                                            Define what could a compromise mean? For every factor/feature, What is a boundary below which it is unacceptable?
                                            Eg- durability.
                                    Ppl may wanna cheat by hiding its deficiencies- be aware of use cases, risk evaluation.

                    Eg- Fridge
                            use case - to cool anything, increase shelf life of products, icecream doesn't melt.
                            Risk - Stabilizer, mechanical parts (door never closes)
                    Eg- bed
                            factors - substratum make (rassi, synthetic, metal, wood), support (wood, metal), substratum continuum (stripes, plane)
                                    mattress needs good substratum.
                            use case - robust support.
                            Risk - sounds, standing/jumping can it take?, durability - teak wood, etc, cracks.
                            do quikr/olx chat; go watch it and ask questions - check their responses (gestures/facial expressions)
                            use flat and flatmates, ask them to post in quikr to avail their service.
                            someone in pehchan
                    Escapism comes in many faces
                            basically not solving the problem at hand and ignoring it.

                    Criteria
                            eCommerce - attributes that matter and what's ideal
                                    Don't pay more than needs
                                    perform those filters in the eCommerce
                            Search for best 10 in a given budget from websites - do union and intersection - grade them of #times they appears in total #sites.
                            Perform compare with ideals and especially showcase differences and identify tradeoffs.
                                    check if any tradeoff can be surpassed thru eCommerce shortlisting.
                    4GB enough for games - future also
                            2 GB for spare not usable by OnePlus 6 GB - couple of games simultaneously didn't take more than 4.3
                            2 GB after android 6 recommended, 1 b4. Apple has 2 GB standard but fast cuz optimized - 3-4 would be sweet spot.
                    Battery - 4K 2 days - 2K enough but bad exp cuz more proc usage back then
                            doesn't tell about quality of battery
                    OS
                            iOS is easier to use;
                                    easy to use and gets both the hottest apps first and the timeliest software updates
                                    costlier, quality assured, lesser variety, search scope to description not there, 82 vs 18 ceiling done.
                            Android gives you more choice
                                    more hardware choices and more affordable options.
                                    always go for latest versions with bugs fixed and improvements done.
                            Old versions of Android not supported - apps won't get installed on them.
                    Cores
                            multiple cores running in parallel, you can run multiple tasks simultaneously with far more efficiency.
                            software isn’t set up to run across all of these extra cores, then the benefits will be negligible at best
                            4 cores are optimum.
                            without taking too much out of the battery, rather than massively boosting raw processing power
                            1 quad for basic and other for demanding tasks
                            tiny screen mean that these handsets are set up to fully exploit one main app at a time.
                                    app updates and incoming notifications in background
                            Apple continues to run on dual-core - consistently top benchmark tests and real-world performance charts
                    metal or a plastic built - to sustain drop of 2=3 feet.
                    Screen Size
                            4.0 to 5.0 inches, because handsets in this range maximizes versatility and functionality
                                    more comfortable to hold in one hand and they easily fit into your pocket
                                    light weight and neither too big nor too small
                            5-5.5 - for all simple and practical uses.
                                    one hand use possible!!
                                    content in the screen, especially webpages - won’t have to zoom in and out repeatedly to view a webpage or read a document
                            5.5 - 6 - If you like to see HD videos on it.
                                    multi-window mode of android
                                    but some maintain aspect ratio of 18:9 to make 5.8 to fit in hand.
                            Anything larger than a 6-inch display not just makes the handset extra bulky, but also difficult to carry around
                    Processor
                            heavy user who need to edit images/videos/documents online, play heavy games, stream videos or often use apps in split screen mode, then smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 or Snapdragon 820/821 should make multitasking fluid for you.
                            Snapdragon 835, A11 Bionic for Iphone - best mobile chip yet.
                    Camera
                            High MP != better.
                                    Ignore MP!
                                    Higher number of pixels mean that the size of the image is bigger - sharper when seen on a small screen
                            f/2.0-f/2.2 aperture - in low lights!!
                                    aperture (lower numbers are better)
                    Battery
                            heavy user and work on apps, play games, stream videos and more then go for a smartphone with at least 3500mAh battery or above
                            average or light user, a handset with 3000mAh battery good enough for a day
                    UI
                            basic and pure Android experience - Moto, Nexus, 
                            Others - more nifty features to sort applications and more options in styles for making friendly.
                    Storage
                            16GB are a rip-off (overpriced), 
                            keep less number of apps on your devices, you can go for 32GB storage - store more games, photos and video
                            larger number of apps can go for 64GB or 128GB variants or add to microSD card - 64GB is the new standard for flagship 
                    Network
                            4G coverage is only going to get better, and that's where the carriers are spending most of their money right now. You can assume that all 4G phones also support your carrier's 3G and 2G networks as well. There are a few reasons you might still settle for a 3G phone

                                            three big OSs right now – Samsung’s Tizen, Google’s Android TV and LG’s WebOS. In addition, Panasonic runs its TVs on Firefox OS.
                                                    already invested heavily in Google products and software, then a set that runs Android TV is the obvious choice.
                                                    All the personalized data from your apps, including your YouTube history and your Google Photos, will easily sync with your new device.
                                                    Plus, you’ll receive bonus features such as built-in Chromecasting and the ability to mirror your Android smartphone on the television.

                                            Samsung	Tizen	Tizen is extremely fast, and it’ll automatically detect devices that you connect to the TV, labeling inputs accordingly. Plus you can control some connected devices with the TV remote.
                                            LG		WebOS	WebOS is extremely simple and fun to use and supports motion controls with the included remote.
                                            Sony	Android TV	If you use an Android phone, this should be immediately familiar. Sony smart TVs support Google Cast, which lets you project content from your phone (or tablet) onto your TV.
                                            TCL		Roku	Like Roku streaming boxes, Roku OS is awesome, featuring simple navigation and a best-in-class search that looks through every app for your chosen content. There’s also voice search!

                                            set-top boxes and streaming sticks are great alternatives that offer nearly all the functionality of a smart TV at an affordable price
                                            Roku’s products (like the Streaming Stick+) do a great job of turning dumb TVs into smart ones, as do Google’s Chromecasts and Amazon’s Fire TV devices.

                            LED is just another LCD TV with Light Emitting Diodes instead of Cold Cathode Fluorescent lights.
                            consume very less energy compared to LCD televisions. The contrast is much better on LED TVs.
                            more reliable compared to LCD TV or a plasma TV and longer lifespan.
                            black levels are enhanced and you will see the truest of colours
                            plasma and OLED, which are emissive technologies where each pixel is its own discrete light source, 
                                    LCD is a transmissive technology where each pixel has to be illuminated from behind, or backlit.
                            Types of LED
                                    full array - standard CCFL backlight
                                            Full array LED set have LEDs just behind the screen in grid of zones that can be lit up or darkened individually.
                                            local dimming, LED backlit.
                                            local dimming done right are Samsung's UNB8500 series and LG's LH8500 series but LCD.
                                    edge lit - to create even thinner TVs, engineers needed to eliminate that extra layer of LEDs and move it to the sides of the display
                                            light is projected inward to the middle of the TV via "lightguides"
                                            common today.
                                            Edge-lit TVs are really thin, but uniformity suffers
                                    OLED - Organic LED
                                            OLED TVs are better than full array LED-LCD.
                                            layer of organic LEDs controlled at the pixel level to achieve absolute black and stunning levels of contrast.
                            Plasma TVs create a picture by sending an electrical charge that is applied to a small sheet of tiny plasma cells.
                            LCD TVs are composed of liquid crystal compressed between two glass plates and backed by a fluorescent lamp. When you apply an electrical charge to the crystal, an image is created.
                            LED TVs are LCD panels, but instead of using the fluorescent (CCFL) backlight lamp, they use an LED backlight.
                    Size
                            Size, brightness (in light, does it show)
                            at least a 50" screen - distance based for immersive experience - may trading size for quality
                                    the size - managable?
                                    Consider where you will place it.
                                    The Bigger the Better - 36" for bedroom, 42-50 for living room.
                                    according to your room size. Normally 40 to 55 inch is best
                                    how many people in your home or office typically watch TV - considering living room - sweet spot is 55 inch.
                                    Screen size is measured diagonally
                    Resolution
                            The screen resolution tells about the sharpness of TV picture usually in terms of horizontal lines of pixels
                                    Many streaming services like Youtube, Amazon Video and Netflix offering 4k content - looks vivid and life like.
                            Full HD TV which supports 1080p resolution vs UHD / 4K resolution TV if budget permits
                            1080p versus 4K? A standard Bluray’s output is 1080p. I've noticed in 2017 a few 4K resolution Blurays in the stores. Content in 4K is increasing.
                                    deeper pockets, go 4K. Otherwise 1080p is an excellent value at present.
                            1080p as being the main target, '4k' is an immature technology and unstable
                    after buy
                            never try to clean it's screen with a wet cloth or water. Led panels are highly sensitive of water
                            do not install TV under Air Conditioner
                            should sit at a distance from you TV that is 3 times more that height of the screen for HD and 1.5 tim the screen height for 4K Ultra HD
                    Brands
                            Go for a premium brand like Sony, Samsung, LG or Panasonic if you don't have a budget limitations.
                            go for good brand as you will make this TV last
                            Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic. This 4 brands are on the top and giving best features.
                            Panasonic TVs are good with prices and longitivity - friend owning shop - least complaints.

                                                French Revolution
													Feudalism and Unfair Taxation
														downward economic spiral in late 1700 and a fuedal society => brink of rebellion
														King Louis 16 asked advisors to review financial treasury - all said need for radical changes in taxation.
														appointed controller general of finance, Calonne - pleaded nobility to cease their exemption from taxation - they refused.
													The Estates-General
														convene the assembly of representatives of french population
														attainment of any such solution was unlikely cuz 2 of 3 estates (clergy and nobility) tax exempt
														3rd estate representing single vote for the public although huge in size => Fueds of disparity
														Realizing number advantage => sovereign National Assembly declaration => many switched allegiances.
													The Bastille and the Great Fear
														Tennis Court Oath - constitution
														stormed prison Bastille, in pursuit of arms
															peasants and farmers revolted against their feudal contracts by attacking the manors and estates of their landlords
														Great Fear => August Decrees - freedom of farmers from oppressive contracts.
														Declaration Of The Rights Of Man And Of The Citizen - judicial code and french people autonomy.
													Rifts in the Assembly
														Constitution but short lived peace.
														King caught in a foiled escape plot - Moderate and radical groups.
														Fear of revolutions in neighbors - Declaration Of Pillnitz - insisting king to throne.
														hotile declaration -> declared war on Austria and Prussia
													The Reign of Terror
														National Convention - monarchy abolition.
														1793 Executed Louis of treason.
														Committee of public safety - foreign police pressed inside french territory - enraged people overthrew Girondin-led National Convention.
														Jacobins, led by Maximilien Robespierre, took control
															conscripting French soldiers and implementing laws to stabilize the economy - seemed that France’s fortunes might be changing
															paranoid about counterrevolutionary influences, embarked upon a Reign Of Terror
															more than 15,000 people executed at the guillotine
															army successfully removed foreign invaders and the economy finally stabilized
															no justification for his extreme actions - arrested and execute in 94 - aka Thermidorian Reaction
														governmental restructuring - Constitution Of 1795 - conservative National Convention
															Directory - group for executive responsibilities and appointments - with no legislative power but abuse of power soon came
													Napoleon
														Committee of Public Safety’s war effort was realizing unimaginable success.
														young general Napoleon Bonaparte - drove through Italy to Egypt until deflating defeat.
														political upheavals in France, Napoleon returned to Paris
														lead a Coup against the Directory in 1799 - naming himself “first consul”
														End of revolution - France entered a fifteen-year period of military rule.

                                        You are hunter gatherer
                                                Gathering Berries
                                                Hunting Rabbits
                                        There are options are to consider and trade offs.
                                                Case A- 5 Rabbits, 0 Berries
                                                Case B- 4 Rabbits, 100 Berries (all other things are same- time, place, etc- ceteris paribus- cetera (all other things), peribus (are same))

                                                Case F- 0 Rabbits, 300 Berries
                                        What should you choose for most profit?
                                                Plot a graph Rabbits vs Berries
                                                This graph is production possibilities frontier
                                                4.5 rabbits (on an average), I will end up getting about 50 berries
                                                anything outside of curve (excluding origin) is impossible
                                                Inside region is possible but not not optimal/efficient (my resources not at full use like factory)
                                        Opportunity Cost
                                                Mood of more proteins
                                                If I catch 1 more rabbit (from scenario E (I am at) to scenario D), what will I have to give up (40 berries)
                                                So, opportunity cost of 1 more rabbit DELTA (X) = 1, is 40 berries DELTA (Y) = -40
                                                aka Marginal cost (for 1 more of x), give up what of y.
                                                Opportunity cost of 20 more berries, I am gonna give up rabbits- 1 rabbit.
                                                        marginal cost = 1 more berry = 1/20th of rabbit.
                                        Increasing Opportunity Cost
                                                as we increase rabbits, my loss of berries goes on decreasing.
                                                Case F says even if rabbit licking your bow and arrow- you don't hunt
                                                        and waste that time picking berries high up on the branches
                                                        better I should have got easy slow rabbits
                                                        I can try I little more effort and rabbits having quicker, smarter rabbits
                                                This shows up in form of bell shaped curve.
                                                with increasing x, there is more and more y to give up.
                                        Allocative Efficiency and marginal benefit
                                                you are at any point on PPF, you gain but have to give up sth.
                                                which point is the best to prefer- allocative efficiency- which meets our requirements best.
                                                marginal cost of rabbit (in berries)
                                                        F- 20
                                                        E- 40

                                                Rabbits vs Marginal cost in berries
                                                        Plot a graph- show a straight line- it mostly is.
                                                        I am in scne F- I pay in berries for a rabbit- 100
                                                        in E, my willingness for rabbit is lesser, I won't pay that much in berries- may be 80 to pay for
                                                        In D, 60
                                                        In C, 40
                                                        In B, how much berries to pay for incremental rabbit- 20 maybe.
                                                        Marginal benefit curve is obtained.
                                                Choice
                                                        If I am at F (I would rather pay 200 berries for rabbit), but have to lose 20 berries to get a rabbit.
                                                        so I better go rise to E (let go off 20 berries to get to E)
                                                        At point D, I have 2 rabbits, and have to let go 60 berries for an extra rabbit
                                                        My benefit beyond D is reducing- profit of getting an extra rabbit is much less (Marginal benefit- how much I value that rabbit in terms of berries is reducing)
                                                                I have to lose 80 berries to gain an extra rabbit which I value worth 40 berries (I don't want to do it)
                                                Investment- Growing the PPF (production possibilities frontier)
                                                        He has become a carnivore, want to increase his happiness by inc numbers
                                                        He want to increase his rabbits per day
                                                        He has put up a trap- He has to build traps
                                                        He spends whole time to making rabbit traps, no rabbits
                                                        Or no trap and catch 5 rabbits
                                                        Or reduce a rabbit but make a rabbit trap
                                                        His PPF expands as x-grows (rabbits/day)- investment has paid.
                                                        He can either spend time on consumption or reduce consumption and allocate resources for investment
                                                        So graph is factually- Investment vs Consumption.
                                                        In the process what he gets is what we call as economic growth.
                                                        Or maybe do RnD and build newer and smarter rabbit traps.
                                                Comparative advantage specialization and gains from trade
                                                        Cups vs plates production- assumes he has linear curve
                                                        OC 10 plates = 30 cups (charlie)
                                                        1 plate = 3 cups (making or gaining 1 plate costs me worth of 3 cups)
                                                        Patty on other hand,
                                                        has OC 30 plates = 10 cups
                                                        1 plate = 1/3 cups (making plate costs 1/3 cup)
                                                        It is cheaper for Patty to produce a cup.
                                                        So Patty has comparative advantage in plates cuz OC is lesser than charlie.
                                                        who has advantage for cups- charlie 1/3 plate and Patty 3 plates
                                                        Charlie has comparative advantage in cups
                                                        If both of them specialize their PPF will grow.
                                                                Charlie produces 30 cups and Patty produces 30 plates- every day.
                                                                Assume they agree to exchange 1 cup for 1 plate.
                                                                Charlie gains cuz he had to pay 3 cups to make a plate but is getting a plate for worth of 1 cup in exchange
                                                                Their marginal cost < opportunity cost
                                                                If they agree on exchanging 15:15- they end up being at a point on graph which was unattainable thru their own PPF.
                                                Comparative advantage and absolute advantage
                                                        imagine 40 plates vs 40 cups
                                                        OC per plate  = 1 cup/ plate
                                                        or OC per cupt = 1 plate
                                                        earlier was 3 plates- comparative advantage is reduced from 3 to 1.
                                                Law of Demands
                                                        Inc price, Dec quantity demanded and vv.

                                                        Price vs Quantity demanded- inverse curve

                                                                If substitutes increase their price, my demand curve will shift to right- at given price- more ppl will want to buy my book
                                                                If complement's price increase (like kindle), then my demand curve shifts to the left.
                                                        Demand word refers to the the behavior of the curve, I choose a point of price and qty can be figured.

                                                        If income increases, more disposable money, then demand goes up and vv.
                                                                True for normal goods, not for all.
                                                        If population goes up, more ppl will want to buy and vv.
                                                        If preferences change, change the curve
                                                                eg- talk show on ebook- more ppl will want to buy it
                                                                eg- bad news plagiarism by author - demand goes down.
                                                Market Equilibrium- normal and inferior goods
                                                        demand curve for lapy, so for car
                                                        income effect for each product
                                                        for lapy- at any price point, higher quantity will be demanded. This is normal good.
                                                        for car- more money, ppl go for nicer car (assume developed car)- whole curve should shift to the left strangely.
                                                                called inferior goods- cheapest car we are talking about.
                                                                ppl will compromise with cheap car with low income but costly if more money.

                                                Law of Supply
                                                        If price goes up, quantity supplied goes up and vv.
                                                        supply going up is the curve moving

                                                        for increasing my gains- more incentive to produce it.
                                                        Price vs quantity produced next year
                                                                There's some minimum price for which we start to produce grapes
                                                Factors affected supply (say grapes)
                                                        if inputs (labors, etc) increase their cost, it's demotivation to production.
                                                                supply shifts to left
                                                        price of related goods (substitutes) say blue berries go up- I can do better with blue berries- supply dec for grapes.
                                                        No of suppliers go up, aggregate supply goes up.
                                                        Technology improves, supply improves
                                                        Expected future prices (price expectation)
                                                                if oil prices going to go up, lower supply today for more supply later.
                                                Market Equilibrium
                                                        say apples
                                                        supply vs quantity supplied and demand vs demand quantity
                                                        draw both curved overlapped in the graph
                                                        if price was kept lower to equilibrium point, quantity demanded would be high but supply too short
                                                                we have shortage of 3K apples in market
                                                                what will happen next week- ppl will bid up for apples- prices will rise.
                                                                Since prices go up, incentives for suppliers to produce more. the suppliers move up the curve.
                                                                shortage keeps reducing to equilibrium point.
                                                        Imagine, price goes so high, we suppliers, high incentives produced in great bulk
                                                                but qty demanded for high price will be lesser
                                                                we face surplus in market, apples won't sell good for ever, they start reducing apples price
                                                                produced quantity also starts to go down. suppliers move down the curve.
                                                        Always converge to the point called equilibrium price, where qty supplied = qty demanded.
                                                Changes in market equilibrium
                                                        New disease resistant apples invented
                                                                suppliers incentive to produce more (their production increases)
                                                                cuz price input by suppliers has reduced
                                                                so price of apples in market will reduce and qty went up.
                                                        Study release apples prevent cancer
                                                                ppl will demand higher qty of apples (for benefits)
                                                                demand curve shifts to the right- price of apples increase.
                                                                quantity also increase

                                                                Here quantity definitely went down
                                                                supply falls way too much then price goes up.
                                                                Demand falls too much, then price goes down.
                                                        Apple pickers unionize and demand wage increase
                                                                supply would decrease, quantity goes down and price shoots up.
                                                Price elasticity of demand
                                                        How does qty demanded affected by change in price
                                                        Percentage change in Quantity / Percentage change in P- Unit cancel out
                                                        @Rubberband- inelastic won't stretch a lot. But elastic- pulls a lot.
                                                        Very Elastic- price change leads to large change in demand.
                                                        Inelastic- price changes leads to small change in demand.
                                                        Burgers per hour increase (2 to 4) when price reduced from 9 to 8.
                                                                Ed (elasticity of demand) = 2/3*100 / -1/8.5*100 = -5.67
                                                                denominator is taken as average else different result when direction of change is diff.
                                                        It is percentage change and not change of price to qty- the base comes into picture.
                                                        If Ed = 1, then unit elasticity
                                                        lt; 1, inelastic, > 1, hghly elastic.

                                                        so perfect inelastic. of course, within reason.
                                                        cuz 0/anything = 0
                                                        It's a vertical line demand curve.

                                            needed from morning till night - with children, with traffic police, with office, with home.

                                                    research or product knowledge - be specific I need with these specifications and bill on email.

                                                                            can't afford

                                                                    call your vendor in the last - give credit, deliver, trust you.
                                                                    go to manufacturer - behave like whole seller.
                                                            do your research - able to quote data and even show data.
                                                                    brings confidence in the during phase.
                                                    determine your first offer, target price and worst case scenario (in mind)

                                                            ask to speak with someone higher - they can give you better deals.
                                                    behavior
                                                            be firm - firm words
                                                                    be a good communicator
                                                                    don't speak too much.
                                                                    stand your ground
                                                                            find out why they are selling
                                                                            price floor might set by an alternate factor - rend, loans, car parts. Back out then.
                                                                            quick deal could mean they are hiding somethings - ask questions. Keep asking questions.
                                                                            "buyer's remorse" even if right product is bought too quickly.
                                                            wait
                                                                    persistence - don't be in rush to do a deal
                                                                    silence is important
                                                                            don't be scared by silence in negotiating
                                                                            this goes in your favor as buyer.
                                                            build rapport - 
                                                                    talks
                                                                            ask for their name and share yours - also use it - psychologically they like you scoring a better deal.
                                                                                    that's a nice car. how are kids.
                                                                            make it long enough thru talks (general) to feel comfortable - too much is creepy and too little doesn't help.
                                                                            find things that you have in common.
                                                                    body language
                                                                            smile - toes pointed towards them; remove objects separating you; use names, shake hands.
                                                                            shake hands after the deal is done.
                                                                            acting dumb makes them explain stuff to you and thus, they start to like you.
                                                                                    if they are the best and you have done research, they know you will come crawling back to them.
                                                                            match their body language - while they are talking with others observe.
                                                                            don't like the price? lean your body back, subconsciously it will help.
                                                            contain your excitement
                                                                    don't physically hold the item
                                                                    you are already getting a great deal on those - can i get a discount - why you think 7 will say yes.
                                                    observer
                                                            be a good observer - fumbles then it's an opportunity.
                                                                    and don't let him read you.
                                                    numbers
                                                            don't make the first offer
                                                            if you know a price, quote first. 
                                                                    nobody likes offended so making 25K to 20K is a big deal (naak katna) but if you start with reference he can adjust accordingly.
                                                            never accept first offer - next can be better.
                                                            don't bluff - he knows; he deals with lots of bluffing customers.
                                                            it can even go other way round - their first offer - say no and give a counter offer and believe that you will meet somewhere in the middle.
                                                            Cash says you are serious - 
                                                                    you can even walk away and they will call you back (eg - in airlift, show him picture of his advantage) - well I am interested but numbers not right.
                                                                    1 in hand better than 2 in bush - also, all I have is 40$ for 50$ item - do you want it - yes, whatever.
                                                            never give your price floor or ceiling (they should be kept in mind)
                                                            low enough to be annoying but not offensively low (that also shows you have no knowledge of market)
                                                                    that should get them to say no - if yes, then it means you could have gone below.
                                                                    spend some time with your number that you thought about it.
                                                                    eg ebay offers at x and you offer < x - they will say "no".
                                                            verbally express some mild dissatisfaction as numbers go up.
                                                                    like 600 is all - nth more than that. it is a tug of war of determination.
                                                                    let's take middle ground.
                                                            regular customer
                                                                    tell them how loyal you are to them. I have been a customer for years.
                                                                    cellphone provider - I have been with the sim for n years. I love the service but anyways, reduce the cost.
                                                                    or give an impression that you will be and there will be future deals.
                                                            don't salami yourself - don't break down price for items - total and discount on the total and reduce on what you don't want.???
                                                            explanation and then price - other store has it for 60, will you go for 40.
                                                            I have been customer for 2 years. could you reduce my bill to 40.
                                                            favorite phrase - "Is that the best you can do?"
                                                            window shopper vs I am interested in buying then proper attention.
                                                                    try some other shop.
                                            after
                                                    prices were more, don't regret. don't cancel the deal - be the man of your word.
                                                            if he made money, khaane do na yaar!! Win Win - daal roti khayenge wo bhi.
                                                            don't criticize the seller and spoil relationship - you may have to revisit him.
                                                    prices were less
                                                            he may back out - don't make him realize it.
                                                            don't show your happiness. next deal can get affected.
                                                    make it combo - throw in extras
                                                            environment to get combos. what's about that spare tile.
                                                            if not satisfied with the price - ask to add something extra.
                                                    have an escape plan - to avoid being rude
                                                            meeting or appointment
                                                            create a little rush - get out of jail card 
                                                            permanent immediate reason to leave
                                                            like pick someone, make wife feel good
                                            why
                                                    most people are bad at negotiations so improving a little gives you huge advantage.
                                                    value to consumer and producer - what do you want from item. additional components paying which you won't use don't do it.

                                    GST
                                    Ultimately GST or any other indirect tax is paid by the customer.
                                    Retailer just only collect it from customer on the behalf of government & deposite it in the government accounts.
                                    all the compliance w.r.t return filing, payment etc. are done by retailers (Businesses) but all these taxes are actually recovered from Customers (buyers).
                                    Suppose you are a retailer of an item on which GST charged is 25%. Suppose you buy it at ₹500 (with GST included), it means that you paid ₹100 as GST. 
                                    (You can easily deduce this by doing simple maths as price with GST -  price without GST i.e. 500−(500÷1.25)=100 ). 
                                    And suppose, the person who buys this item from you at ₹600 (with GST included) is the final consumer of the item, 
                                            then it means that out of ₹600, the total GST to be received by the government is ₹120 (again by the same maths logic i.e. price with GST - price without GST i.e. 600−(600÷1.25)=120 ) 
                                            and you collect it from this person on behalf of the government. 
                                            But, you have already paid ₹100 as GST, so the government will collect ₹20 more from you. 
                                    In this way, the govt has collected its ₹120 as GST and you have made profit of (600−500)−20=80 i.e. ₹80.
                                </GST>

                                    Debit vs Credit - + means all favors, gains, assets and - means all liabilities or losses.
                                        Eg - went to restaurant - debit was the plate of snacks and credit is the money we paid for it.
                                    Credit card also records debits and credits on your credit card (meaning you debit the services and use card for crediting at the end of the month)
                                        it the the credit card company which suffers the credits until it gets debit at the end of the month - so it is credit card from the company's perspective.
                                        at the header of the statement, you will have the services you debited, cash and also credit section saying how much you paid back.
                                        debit card - cuz you credit salary to your bank account, but debit card lets you debit services as and when you require along with credit money attached to the bank (not your credit)
                                        salary bank says money credited to your account - your credit but bank's debit. On payment at POS, debit of service and bank bears the credit and attaches that to your bank account.

								Applications
									Overcome Fears
											aware of fear - list down
											Stare at fearless people - your ideal future self
											Be objective - Triggers of social situ, mental situ, action / response.
											willing to look stupid - willing to risk the emotional pain of making mistakes (Wayne Gretzky fell on his tail a ton)
													making mistakes will help you obtain information to correct behaviors
											mindset of gratitude
													solos recently, and it is scary!  Instead of freaking out, I have decided to be grateful for the opportunity to communicate musically with so many people
													ppl want u succeed and get rooted
											Seek out teachers - someone who scares you a little; brutally honest and gives clear directions
											Share - how others might react
													people feel the same way as you do, and have stories to share as well
													fear of success, or a fear of failure - help you examine what you truly want from life
											Embrace struggle - struggle feels like failure but no pains, no gains. Once we struggle, fear slowly disintegrates
											Read - fill my world with motivational and inspirational books on, and related to, the topic I’m dealing with.
											Use visualization - Imagine yourself in a scary situation without fear
													Watch people do things fearlessly that would normally freak you out.  Visualize yourself as that person.
											Put things in perspective - Putting your negative thoughts in perspective is a huge way to overcome fear
													while u are afraid life is moving on w/o u.
											Release control - we want to be in control, but when we relinquish it we tend to free ourselves up
													We learn from our failures, but to fail we need to release control.
											Think about the worst case scenario
													What’s the worst that could happen? I have crumbled on stage in front of hundreds of people.
													My wife still loved me; I lived. Life goes on.
											Look within
													root of your fear? Meditate on it
													ask yourself when the fear started
    			                            Overcoming fear requires a growth mindset; an attitude that we can grow and change if we choose. Nothing is “locked in” forever; we can change.  It takes time and practice.
									Confidence, etc.

                                Meditations
                                what 
                                        not behavioral changes but structurally how you perceive the world and think (not tips but foundational stuff)
                                        not monolithic but types - no stop thinking; 
                                                all have different effects on your life. 1 may not be for me.
                                why 
                                        Scientifically recognized
                                                increases grey matter ; 
                                                improve cognitive performance - 30 days b4 leaving.
                                        days were more useful
                                        Comfortable Alone
                                                meditation makes you comfortable being alone.
                                                Pascal - all of man's problem is not able to sit alone with himself.
                                                pick ppl based on mutual how much value.
                                        awareness - compulsive addictive thinking (liberation)
                                                beat yourself over problem and feel sad vs what's the solution approach
                                                problem finding or solving machines - nth gonna happen if you are absent for 30 mins but solving is what matters.
                                        increased my athletic performance

                                ==================
                                struggling relationship - ends not way you wanted
                                        why relp go bad - comes from soil
                                        many interpretations to experiences influenced by marketing
                                                macs just work
                                                        bad hinges - keyboard coming out - get mac it works
                                                        ads - direct experiences are shadowed by marketing
                                                travel photos 
                                                        travel doesn't look like phots - lines, langs, food and locals out of culture but photos wow
                                                        whitewashed version of travel - it is worth time and money - but not true.
                                                        this comes from movies and marketed idea that travels are awesome.
                                                idea is romantic relp is key to happiness - highly marketed idea
                                                        movie and songs end happy - break up songs misery and next person works

                                                REL - money is amazing, experiences and friends - but other things also.
                                                10 M dollar then they have proven  and are worthwhile

                                                healthy relp - contentious idea that "no romance but thrilling life"

                                                not that I made a good decision proud of that
                                                but even though things of past not as I wanted - I care for myself.

                                        insecurity stimulus for growth; feeling love makes your complacent

                                                different kinds of fuels - insecurity in beginning with me; ppl use anger, fears - fumes can take you very far.

                                                I decide to accept ; past things that not proud but from now on I will.
                                                ridiculous in front of mirror - commit to it - do it ritualistically - bring body language.

                                why you don't feel good enough - Most Profound and Personal video
                                        1.5 years and broke - for that long is not fun ; realization that long term vision not in line.
                                        not that we wanted but needed to wind up.
                                        bawling - show that I care but not fabricate tears
                                        hug and kiss that I love - numbness left for day - loneliness and sadness
                                        feelings typed out on notepad or audio recording on phone
                                        dumbest thing went to facebook - a pic never seen before - angry that so soon she would go out.
                                                these are low standards !! work on business and music, friend, travel more, more worldly - I am in death fight.
                                                with friends wondering what she must be doing now.
                                                impossible to live your live in a happy way.

                                                Sth similar happened to me
                                                Man, I hope you are ok - I was grateful to that guy for making us that happy
                                                pivotal shift - sharing the happiness for other ppl even when you don't
                                                love meant negatively impact peron - made her cry => she loves me.
                                                        I cried in night - I want her to know
                                                        bad defn of love - want to see her happy. where does that come from - not that from other friends ain't good.
                                                        I wanted to be the one to make her happy.
                                                        3rd defn - need the other person - not needing me or I get over her quickly then no real love
                                                                negative spiral - only way to demonstrate was to stay hurt.
                                                        better definition of love - love means truly wanting the happiness of someone else no matter what.
                                                                should be grateful for someone to do that to her.
                                                        same love for myself - no predetermined grieving period 
                                                                gonna try feel good immediately 
                                                                doesn't diminish what she meant to me
                                        Crux - genuine feelings of love - need to feel loved first
                                                babies that are not loved literally die
                                                ppl thrive for love
                                                        life goes out of whack - eth breaking down, health, get mean.
                                                @table top supported with legs - friends making me feel loved, friends, family, gf
                                                        all give sense of well being - they are all unstable by very nature of life.
                                                        1 goes down and out of whack - not nice with how things go with ppl.
                                                        strengthen other legs - table is wobbly by nature
                                                        ppl leave and temporary nature - vaccation for 1 month - shaky leg.
                                                        reinforce these legs - brace around legs
                                                        braces are different to different ppl 
                                                                if you leave me, I hurt myself - that makes them certain.
                                                                I will make myself very important for that person 
                                                                then these braces become negative cuz of nature of world
                                                                I say come back back 2 weeks early cuz you will not like it - concerned about my shaky leg.
                                                        best solution is marble pillar coming up from the ground through your well being table - support of self love.
                                                                I have done lots of things that make me feel good about me
                                                                self love nth to do with achievements or goals
                                                                unconditional - like with other person - so with me - no matter what I accept myself.
                                                                on worst days and best days I love myself equal.
                                                                central pillar can sustain the other legs - adding or removing.
                                        Action Step
                                                Every emotion is a habit - play cord in piano like - clumpsy but make neural pathway with every single time.
                                                habit with emotions we have - guilt or angry easily, or sad, or joyful at slightest things.
                                                retrain them with practice - spiral of comparison in my case.
                                                break the pattern - eye scramble rolling with happy birthday song he gave me.
                                                        looks and feels ridiculous but I wanna be better than him is not the feeling I want.
                                                neutral now then give what you wanna feel. respected or important feeling - the underlying feelings you want is still love - love fills you up.
                                                tons of exerices later - mirror and say out loud - even though you feel jealous - I love and accept you as you are.
                                                goofy cuz self talk , feel good - feed self love, can't feel love for other ppl until you fill yourself up.
                                                        can you extend to person you want the least.
                                                        3 stages - interrupt, feed self love to overflow, give it to others
                                                                @oxygen mask - first yourself then others.
                                                just happy for their happiness - wanna be the one who made them happy.
                                                        that guy won the match - that's amazing cuz it was that guys dream - even though not my nation or whatever.
                                                if anything you didn't like I rambled too fast or so - let me know in comments.
                                Social Media ruining your life
                                        if you are an alien looking at the Instagram newsfeed you would have to conclude that 
                                                leisure smiles, honeymoons, crying in laughter than actually doing so, success
                                                none of that is true.
                                        Consumption 
                                                designed to be more addictive than crack. 
                                                articles do little more than waste your time. 
                                                Depression cuz of misrepresentation vs soa.
                                        Creation
                                                Persona - think of it this way every time you post a photo you are contributing to the creation of a persona kind of like in a video game 
                                                        Sophistication - you post a photo in front of the Eiffel Tower and your sophistication stat goes up 
                                                        Beauty - you delete a photo where you look bad and your beauty stack goes
                                                        Funny - share a funny meme and your humor stack goes up you choose these photos specifically because you want those stats to go up 
                                                you want that persona to be seen in a certain way
                                                        embarrassing boring disaligned chucked out - but get attached to persona (and say that is ME) and wanna protect it.
                                                        every selfie needs to be special. Jokes need to be funny enough - being judged based on that
                                                        but you don't look, act clever all the time, these are fragments of your life selected to make you appear a certain way.
                                                crave validation from the legs in the comments they don't really make you happy
                                                        in fact the more that you care about those likes the more that I can guarantee you will be unhappy
                                                                energy to create and manage identity - dressing, backdrop, angle, filter, edit, thinking witty tweets. 
                                                        trying to control how strangers perceive your reality when you do this and it is incredibly taxing
                                                second you sacrifice your own experience to promote your identity 
                                                        last year a girl a new backpack to Asia and after the first week she was homesick and physically sick she felt lonely and hated it but she continued for weeks
                                                                more because she was afraid of what people would think if she left she was afraid that they would think she was a failure 
                                                                the whole time she posted smiling pictures on pristine beaches while people commented how lucky she was
                                                                which only made her feel more stuck we don't do the things we want to do 
                                                        because we care more about what other people think of us than what we think of ourselves
                                                third you outsource your happiness to the masses have you ever been bummed
                                                        that you didn't get enough likes on a photo if so you are literally outsourcing your happiness 
                                                        kind of dependence on the reactions of others especially strangers is a classic road to misery you can spend your whole life trying to please a group of people
                                                                that you barely even know force curating an identity stops you from investing in you getting physically fit takes months of hard work and discipline choosing a
                                                        flattering angle adding a filter and taking a photo with the gym takes about 30 seconds so it's no wonder that many
                                                        people choose to work more on their persona than on themselves
                                                        persona flourishes but health stagnates - benefit of actually being fit 
                                                curating an identity limits you
                                                        need to be a certain way on social media for most people that's smiley and happy 
                                                        for others that's whiny and outrage 
                                                        either way you lock yourself into a fixed identity that dictates not only what you share but how you act you forget that you owe
                                                        we have a choice on how you want to behave now let me make this clear this 
                                                        isn't just limited to Instagram this happens on Facebook on snapchat reddit twitter pinterest and youtube (at my expense)
                                        Offline as well 
                                                we tell stories to build ourselves up 
                                                in the clothes in the cars
                                                we buy to brand ourselves
                                                we create a persona and then sacrifice our lives in order to promote it so yes I mean it
                                        given the way the technology is going there's nothing you can do about it - the end - just kidding
                                                while quitting social media is an obvious and effective
                                                        it just doesn't solve the whole problem we still have to break free of 
                                                        the desire to be seen and judged in a certain light 
                                                        we need to learn to let our actions speak for themselves Plus
                                                not all bad
                                                        brief meeting on social media that became cherished relationship.
                                                        how can you remove all that bad still retaining the good
                                                first start by limiting your consumption
                                                        avoid the feed Facebook Instagram Twitter snapchat designed for mindless consumption
                                                                at my expense - yes include YouTube
                                                                home page is just more trouble than it's worth and I tell you this at my own expense since the YouTube homepage is where I get most of my views from
                                                                newsfeed Eradicator app will help.
                                                                bookmark specific subreddits for future read - I still cheat all of this 
                                                        uninstall smartphone apps so that websites are only ways which are cumbersome and you will go lesser.
                                                        for a month, stop telling stories that bolster your persona (viz cool party, volunteered)
                                                pay attention to what you enjoy doing - no reason for doing it other than for the experience itself
                                                        enjoy the club when you don't get a geotagged photo 
                                                        do you still go to CrossFit when no one immediately knows
                                                        you went this exercise actually showed me that I like vacations far less than I thought so I stopped taking them 
                                                                and I felt happier plus I saved a bunch of money 
                                                        go do something really cool like skydiving or surfing or maybe something that you should do like
                                                                volunteering or donating blood something that reflects really well on you and
                                                                don't take a picture don't post a status
                                                                don't even tell anyone this is great practice in caring more about your experience 
                                                                and doing the right thing rather than the social validation that comes from it now some of you might be
                                        Business Reasons 
                                                first off don't lie to yourself 
                                                        (How i relate) I know a lot of starting entrepreneurs who think that Facebook and Instagram are important to their business 
                                                        yet their customers come from other channels 
                                                        business people who think that they should have a social media presence yet do nothing to monetize it 
                                        the dopamine withdrawal will be hard but
                                                it's the only way to save your real life and if you legitimately are a professional creator
                                                separate the audience reaction from your identity - happy when 1L subscribers later when 1M subscribers ongoing.
                                                        I hope you get the point that that number in your head will never make you happy 
                                                        subscribers, dollars, clicks, income, lives impacted numbers
                                                        number is just a business metric - it's not a measure of your worth 
                                                similarly the comments aren't about you 
                                                        sometimes about the work you've done 
                                                        oftentimes about the person commenting 
                                                        so take them for feedback and then go back to creating things that move people without wondering what it says about you 
                                        break the cycle of identity creation and preservation
                                                live your life first do the things that you want to do first 
                                                you want to take pictures of those things go ahead just remember 
                                                your character emerges from what you do not from what you broadcast
                                Heroin - chemical hooks in drug - we get addicted.
                                        try 20 days, 21 is easy.
                                        dimorphine - stronger and no dilution on fracture - but none becomes addict.
                                        junkie grandma?
                                        rat with 2 water bottle vs obsession with drugged water until killed itself.
                                        rat is put in cage - if only drugged water - heaven for rats - friends and sex and pipes to play.
                                                didn't use drugged water - no1 overdosed.
                                        Vietnam war - lots of heroin - junkies in street after war - din't go to rehab but stopped after war.
                                        jungle - where you could die any time - heroin. its your cage - think addiction differently.
                                        happy then we associate with people - bombed down by life then replacement to escape - gotta bond with sth
                                        addiction is symptom of disconnection we are feeling in society - stuff over friends.
                                        harder for jobs and support is lesser. find with drugs then cages. hate them and it increases.
                                        think social recovery. make society like rat park and not cages - opposite of addiction is connection and not sobriety.
                                High self esteem is overrated
                                        approaching someone - party or romance - moment of anxiety kicks.
                                        Lacking confidence mindset: I'll be kind to myself if it goes well and it probably won't.
                                                nth interesting to say; that was dumb, what are they gonna say.

                                            all of the unstated beliefs that give context to any interaction.
                                                it gives meaning to the words that we say.
                                                difference in "Cool!" and "cool" comes from belief while saying it
                                                passing through the woods, savage people surround 
                                                    note each person's beliefs that they bring to the interaction.
                                                    surrounded => Controlled --> Killing (Bronn shares the frame and pulls the sword)
                                                    Meaning you ascribe to a situation 
                                                    Tyrion, the dwarf, proposes a totally different frame. 
                                                        acts as if their friend. 
                                                        inviting them to share their food and their fire, like they just stumbled upon him.
                                                The genius of this frame is that if they accept it, he will escape with his life.
                                                    Tyrion mirrors - addressing man with father's and family's name.
                                                    his frame is that they're introducing themselves as friends, but clearly it's not going so well.
                                                    tried this friend frame twice. It's not working, so what can you do? 
                                                    Because this type of situation with much, much lower stakes is going to happen in your life.
                                                        you will want someone to assume your frame but they're going to resist
                                                    so watch how Tyrion handles it.
                                                He totally breaks this guy's frame with humor. See the laughter there? 
                                                    In this frame, and in real life, too, laughter is a telltale sign that someone has had their frame shifted.
                                                    Usually, it's the person who is laughing that has had their way of viewing the world disrupted,
                                                    the guy with the axe thought that Tyrion should choose right then, and right there how he die.
                                                    Tyrion purposely misinterpreted his question. 
                                                    He added a bit of humor and that was enough to make this guy break his frame and laugh. 
                                                    If you've ever tried to be mad at someone while they continually make you laugh over and over and over again, you know what that feels like?
                                                        It gets tough to stay mad at them because they've re-framed you and they've interrupted your pattern of being upset.
                                                        In these moments, right after someone has shifted their frame is when they are most open to being persuaded. 
                                                    persuasion and resistance, don't just keep pushing - Instead, you need to re-frame them and humor is a great way to do it.
                                                You need to disrupt their pattern, you need to re-frame them, and, then, you can begin to speak to their interest and speak more logically.
                                        Insults
                                            Every single insult you've ever said or heard is a frame game. 
                                            Even from the school days of "I'm rubber, you're glue," the goal is, generally, to turn the insult on the person
                                            do not recommend engaging with someone who's putting you down or insulting
                                            I just try to take the frame of this isn't worth my time and then walk away
                                            But informative to watch how frames determines victory while exchanges. 
                                            Tyrion is talking to Robb Stark, who does not like him or his family very much.
                                                a fairly straightforward insult or even just a diss. Tyrion calls Robb "Boy," => Inexperience.
                                                Robb denies calling him Lord - responds he ain't behaving so.
                                                Robb doesn't come out of that exchange looking so great.
                                            Fighting the frame of an insult normally makes you look like a chump.
                                            Robb, has become commander of a huge army, and speaking to a prisoner from Tyrion's family--the family that he hates.
                                                Again, same insult, same guy. You're a boy, you're inexperienced, you're just playing it war while commanding an army.
                                                instead of fighting the frame, Robb flips it, and he uses it to his advantage.
                                                takes the prisoner's own words and uses them against him.
                                                much better because an insult is really just a battle to see who can control who.
                                            When you get mad at an insult and you fight it, you have already lost. 
                                                But when you don't fight the words, and, instead, changes the frame, 
                                                    meaning that you turn their insult into praise for you or an insult to them, then you have taken control. 
                                                That is how you win the frame game; not by having the best zinger, but by being the person in control.
                                        Options
                                            third and most important frame game that I want to talk about is "OPTIONS"
                                            for this, I need to give a little context for non-Game of Thrones fans. 
                                            Tyrion, the dwarf, is wrongfully accused of murdering the king. 
                                            He's basically set-up, his trial is a total farce, 
                                            he's told that his options are death or to plead for his life, 
                                                to be granted exile into the coldest, northernmost part of the world, 
                                                where he basically need to work as a servant for the rest of his life. 
                                            He's told that those are his only choices, and that he better just beg for his life, beg for exile in order to save himself
                                            instead, he creates a third option and this is one of the most famous scenes of the entire series
                                                how Tyrion survives all of his encounters. He creates a third option that other people don't see. 
                                                Everyone thinks that the choice is between exile and death,
                                                and he chooses trial by combat, which, strictly speaking, 
                                                    in this world, is legal, but nobody presents it to him as an option.
                                                Earlier in the series, again, when he was wrongfully framed for another assassination attempt that he didn't commit, he's held in prison until he confesses.
                                                    He can die in prison or confess to a crime that he didn't commit.
                                                    he cleverly stages a confession and uses that public arena to his advantage. 
                                                    He's able to shame his captors into giving him a trial. Watch this.
                                            The point is this--whoever controls the options has the power. 
                                                Your options are rarely exactly what people tell you because that's how people have powers; they control options.
                                                The truth is that everything that is possible changes based on your creativity. 
                                                Nothing is fixed, so you need to be resourceful. You need to not take what other people put on the table as your only choices. 
                                            When you're faced with a decision that says this or that
                                                don't like either choice, refuse them both and create a third way. 
                                                The way out is probably going to be different every time, 
                                                but the realization that your options are never just exactly what people say they are, and that you can break free from the options presented to you,
                                                    is going to be valuable for the rest of your life.
                                        stay alive in the Game of Thrones, and that is how you win in the game of life.

    About - Pursuit of maximal happiness [steaming] thru subscription to a world view (or existence view)
        Benefits and criticism with main points how and why are stated.
            Criticism can also be seen as disadvantages or limitations.
            But criticism is something that we can potentially do something about.
	<Intro>
		PIES - Reflection on Study of "religion"
			Even about religion we can't always talk about.
			Now flawed conclusions (objectively speaking) and taking them to be essence is so characteristic of kali yuga.
				Signs of kali yuga means corruption of life based on universal objective principles (can be scientific if studied under that discipline)
				Others being hypocrisy, quarrel, etc.
			The thing is that these flawed objective models are considered very pop although their foundations are not robust.
			first of all multiple alternative dharma. And to start with corrupt the definition of dharma and in their mind they think that they are being objective.
			religion or badly translated dharma is seen as an objective study while it is not - the very root word will indicate the difference between paradigm and principles.
			what does the model of "religion", that we wanna introduce in our study with the proposed new definition or connotation to the word religion, intend to achieve.
				the intent with this new definition which goes against the root etymology (highly undesirable although norm and pop), is to explain away everything - what everything?
				explain away every behavior or what motivates people to act in certain ways
					call them rituals or lifestyles, at a more psychologically or rather, sukshma level (this is yet another corruption) beliefs and values, etc.
					This is an act of clustering prominent behavioral clusters aka culture (not all behaviors but prominent ones - thus, culture which is already a cluster).
						Now this study is performed under the ashram (SocialErp) which is contrary to how vedic objective study of yoga (need a better word here) or paths of life is based.
						why under ashram? cuz culture is a SocialErp term with clustering characterised mostly by countries and states (although they are political).
				Now, with this usecase in mind, the model known as "study of religions" is proposed.
					Just think for a while, from 1947, with idea of secularism and everything, we bought into this model.
				If you already took religions to mean those who follow a scriptural manual then current pop education also has manuals.
					I am not here to contradict eth like most of the people but to study things systematically.
					If you say just believers of metaphysical transcendence then India has so many adherents in India don't believe transcendence.
					Have you seen people fight over religion - this immediately indicates that your "objective" connotations caused damage rather than help
						of course, outside of cultural standardizations of "religious" lifestyles.
						This means that cultural conflicts of "religions" will cause fights
						REL st act A can be done in A1 way or A2 way but not both (like how to deal with an animal or what to do with a river).
						Some come in and say let A1 be separate and A2 be separate.
						Most of the adherents of paths these days buy into this model - hindu, christian, muslim being famous words coming from there.
						And still fight so your model didn't help anyone to rise to the level of principles but fostered or at least, let continue the conflict.
				Now, let's expand of current idea of religion - it is studying the adherents of only avaroh pantha bhakti marg so that's a limitation of the study.
					Ideal study is to explain it all - all behavioral clusters or culture.
					So, there are 3 marg to start with
					no pursuit - includes other species, apatheism, atheism, I won't say agnostic cuz agnostic can still take any path.
						Even state of confusion or khicadi Indian life falls under this most of the times and this khicadi is what we typically call as hinduism.
						Most of the times this is very trending in kali yuga. And religion model lets them quietly sit in this bucket.
						Surely this can be subdivided but I will postpone this.
						Have you seen how fanatic these people can get - don't underestimate.
							Rejecting the very idea of other subpaths being praised
							or tolerating people subscribing to these paths, forget cherishing or appreciating the richness of it.
							Thinking themselves to be the knower of truths (so typical of other paths) and others groping in ignorance.
					aaroh - with standardizations and building on top of already standardized, we can finally arrive at solutions with our own efforts.
						all margs have their
					avaroh - BJDK margs subdivisions and in Bhakti then are many religions - this excludes buddhism, jainism, etc although they are very close to contemporary hinduism.
					Misc
						Some people may pretend to be transcedental to these margs but none other than SPOG (factually - now this exposes my adherence also) is free from marg.
			why do we buy these terms in the first place - there is a desire to know the truth (aroh pantha) so nothing wrong with that approach.
				but why 1 model is bought so vigorously - cuz something is better than nothing for most people but vedic roots are far more elegant than this.
				one people have a better alternative they can let go of an old model. Wonder why there was no word called hinduism until this model was proposed.
			the downside of broadcasting these notes is newly forming identifications - earlier called hindu atheist will call himself as only atheist, etc.
				but did they anyways developed respect for demigods from their former identifications.
				With following sincere discipline of 1 path - say atheism - people will stop their hodge podge (typical of India) some pious karma cultivation out of their confusion,
				India is khicadi at following paths or margs and it has a positive side also - the share prices get distributed and you don't take and stand a risk.
					Thus, as an Indian you got good of all the paths. And why not - we started with need to explain everything.
					1 path can be that of confusion and shallow explorations (multiple personality) across different lifestyles calling it a life journey - so typical of no pusuit.
					This is very amusing to me. This is outside from study of tattva but may even be desirable.
				Other downsides can be newly forming cultural boundaries - which is good in a sense but can also take undesirable states thru worldly political transitions - world being an FSM.
			And then people expect you to give your ears to them without knowing all these details.
				Try to give some value add on to them or st change the topic or even learn from them if they can do any value add on. St excuse yourself for some engagement.
				the simplest thing is to perfect your life thru SVAF and try to help people AMAP for you to give and their willingness to take.
				Otherwise, even exploring 1 depth is quite a journey. Have you heard that story BSS tells - if you would have dugged in 1 place you could get gold anywhere.
				Follow at least something st SP said.
				So, pop Indian life is BFS and others follow DFS.
				Some say "no don't make religion your life but only that which feels good" - these are typical BFS or khicadi subscribers or confused ones or atheistic fanatics.
			And of course, how can you explain every behavior without taking varna, varna tendencies, ashram into consideration.
				what is donation for a cause - which marg is that - it's ashram of SocialErp and not a marg in spirituality.
				What is the person showing off his power hunt or power hunger - it's his varna tendencies not marg in spirituality.
				what is this so called christian telling others to denigrate deities - it is fanaticism of proving one's worth greater than other paths thru cheap means.
				Ideal practitioners are open to learning from other paths as well and are not strictly Mutex but just full investment into one.
				The exclusivistic "religions" which vedic pratitioners like call then bhakti traditions won't even do that but that's their choice.
				the traditions are further divided into 4 sampradayas and it's a tree from there - we take inspiration from wherever possible.

    <Why>
        It is an exploration of the existence in pursuit of maximizing our happiness.
            With KC, the happiness is seen in transcendental love and service in constrast with worldly love and service - with love being the goal of 9 stages.
            With atheism, it is the philosophical framework for a stand of no higher spiritual dimension exists - so churn your happiness in a life YOLO.
            With voidism, it is a stand for negation.
    </Why>
	<NoPursuit>
		Other species
		Apatheism
		Atheism
		Agnostism is outside and can choose any path.
		Confused
		Khicadi or BFS mode
	</NoPursuit>
    <Apatheism>
        The state of "Don't care". This is somewhat blind stand as opposed to atheism
            this is a state of unwillingness to study or explore.
            Or there can be willingness but the stand is as follows:
            human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.
        Benefits - full focus on what is available than what could be available - so enjoy world to fulleste.
        Criticisms - compromise on the possibilities of what world could offer.
    </Apatheism>
    <Atheism>
        Stand of nothing spiritual transcendental exists
            Frameworks of reality exist at this level also but they don't contradict with possibility of transcendental realm unless any of the theories state more than expected.
        <Flavors> Rejection of Scriptures vs Rejection of Deity
            Buddhism
            Jainism
            Charvakism
            Pantheism
        </Flavors>
        Atheistic arg
            Nutrition- all the elements- figure out- else limiting factor causes suck. why?
            Season extremes- God's design to cause people death from sunburn?
                Ppl die by stroke. Proteins break after 45 Celsius. Carcinogenic.
            Animal attacks in villages,water- natural! Bot fly, deadly-diseases by God?
                    mosquitoes kill them then hell, don't kill them then hell now!
            Without medical science, people were dying early cuz microbes, no operation facilities.
            Live life of complexity without guidance (what should my stand be- for peaceful,happy or BTG stay)
                    But you are not approaching God for guidance or scriptures.
                            bring it forth- if you claim to have answers to questions, make blogs, make websites.
                    you don't approach guru of all disciplines- people figure out, standardize it and pass it down.
                            we have figured it out. No revelation in that context.
            Claim- Everything happens for good!
                    You make most out of everything. Situ was a facility but sth else- would have done some other favor.
            Misguidance scriptures have caused in past.
                    fights over stands.
                    followers focus on few short passages and not the whole theme.
            Atheism-
                it's animal nature that governs the world- imagine why someone would be accepted by everyone as king!?
                    the weak player is sidelined- yes, we can say God arranged it for him (this would be best)- but as he changed his nature- his world changed.
                Compile Time Controller- Every law (or its appearance) is essentially arranged for the best for the jiva (assuming he is all  merciful- he may not be)- purpose he intended (fulfill desires and give purification) vs give us enjoy.
                Compile Time Obligate Controller- Laws didn't automate the life creation- he "chiseled" it out!
                Run Time Facultative controller-
                Run Time obligate controller- All incidents are ultimately best for you. For every human and animal- case studies!!
                I should not start atheist research myself- I have to commit to study from giants and sincerely check for completeness or differences (communication gaps,leaps)
                    when encountering a negative/counter eg in theory while practicing- 1. ask superior (they have dedicated their lives. 2. Refer to width of explnations across other ideologies also.)
                        of course, complete the loop.
                        if studying or practicing, give your heart to it, or don't do it!!
                        accept people for what they are- they have their ideology and thus, bias- and will manipulation emotions accordingly- it's but human nature- doing things on dharma!
                        I can't prove sth wrong doesn't make it right- but a healthy perspective
                You don't have to have colossal agreement or disagreement with any expert of ideology.
                If you get frustrated over questions that seemingly disapprove God. You want to negate incidents which all speak nothing but truth, you are dream lover and not truth lover.
                    get to see the truth the way it is. Not the way I want it.
                    Should I not be open to ideas, at least.
                    I do yoga because that's me. Not because it will take me somewhere- yoga and I are one.
                    What is tough situation, it is just exposure of existing gap between your current state and your ideology.
        Misc - Atheism - take things in package - make person feel indebted and then abduct his soul.
            No1 knows - agnostic to confidence.
            Lust remains - why deny what's natural - high of excitement temporary cuz no channel for higher layers. It's medical problem if no lust.
            it's a well thought framework where everything has an answer - so it qualifies as a great philosophy
                but nevertheless being adding a dimension - there are multiple candidates of what could actually be true.
            solace yourself with false assurance instead of taking a practical and pragmatic stand in the world and accepting world for what it is.
            Health improved after I gave it up completely and accepting "normal" lifestyle - my KC lifestyle was causing all the problems.
            Diwali fire in magazine story - mistake is mistake. Laws don't forgive and go agnostic to your beliefs - gotta fall if imbalance.
                no transcendental narrative going on. Answer is 3 does are there - Jiva, prakriti ishwar and worldly outcome is controlled by them.
                    Jiva wants to push - he gets to do it. Gravity acts anyway. Magnetism and human psychology acts anyways - sanskars and vrittis happen anyway.
        Benefits
            Freedom from controlled life - transcendentally or worldly (scriptures or gurus)
        Criticisms
            Losing out on possibilities if we were wrong about our stand (current life and next)
    </Atheism>
    <Agnosticism>
        About - A fair stand of "I don't know" - not necessarily I don't even care to know!
            Can be read as aaroh pantha - Let's climb up the ladder of logic or arguments to find the AT.
            Although official definition is God exists or not - insufficient data to conclude
                but I take it to mean "I don't know".
                With the former definition, it can come under apatheism.
            it's impossible for human beings to know anything about how the universe was created and whether or not divine beings exist.
        <Flavors>
            Aaroh by worldly services (B)
            Aaroh by Logic (Jnana as in Science (not engg))
                Atheism can also come under this bracket with agnosticism being all about aaroh.
                <Deism>
                    God (to use some word) created the world and no claims of being controller.
                    Compile Time Controller- CTC- BV decreases on Bhoga snatched away? Apparently yes, we grow sober. Eg after PMO- we come to ground and become introspective.
                    <IntelligentDesign>
                        The "God" does not refer to God of scriptures- it may or may not refer to him.

                    Benefits
                        No over-committing so even if losing out on possibilities it is a stand that we should have taken anyways (logicallys speaking)
                    Criticisms -
                        Possibility of lost benefits of any firm stand
                        busy efforts while committing to one of the stands would make you focus on happiness as consequences of that mindset.
                </Deism>
            Aaroh by Worldly meditations (D - neophytes) - Discussions, arguments, mindfulness meditations.

                            came thru metalaws (or same physical, chemical laws that govern)
                                    those laws ever existed- no explanation where they came from.
                                        Even Assembly plant that ends up constructing cars is not a chance but programmed/designed.
                                    natural laws don't even make a small machine (like watch on its own) in universe- how come such big machine?!
                                    Eg- big bang- improbable assumption, no theory has gained general acceptance.
                                        @Do bangs ever produce designs- Mumbai blasts. Hiroshima.

                                        Einstein- I believe harmony of world, not world of chance but appreciate wonders of God.
                                        Kelvin- Think strongly enough, science will force you to believe in God.

                                            why tree growing? cuz nucleus divides. why she divides? diffusion, blah blah. why so? natural laws make it happen.
                                            ultimately we know it is so thru observation- it happens for whatever reason.

                                                    what's life? Mechanistic- bunch of atoms, molecular mesh.
                                                        there's sth valuable about life.
                                                            Mercedes accident- take car to garage, or person to hospital?
                                                            Nails on woman's body- beautiful, cut off then no value.
                                                                ppl burn the dead body (even wife) but love the living. sth valuable about life.

                                                                body parts can be transplanted but not consciousness.
                                                            why ppl cry- if only chemicals are gone.
                                                            is matter conscious?

                                                    What are emotions- Love, angry- mere secretion of chemicals
                                                        That's all! maybe cause, effect, not itself.

                                                        we don't treat ppl as chemical- but with dignity.

                                        Hanuman said- found Sita in Lanka. So conscious of Lord's desperation. In Lanka, Sita I found- desperation would have increased.
                                        Low class servant- bahubal but less service. Middle class- does what's asked. First class- does more than asked (understanding mind of master)

                                Salary for service is more service- love is not to demand anything in return of service.
                                service is not because of a favor but spontaneous expression of love.

                                        Eg- Potters' wheel- pots come out- how they came- rolling wheel made pots- but who rotated it?

                            chetan is more important than jada- deals with consciousness.
                            Chetan is superior to jada

                                        What- Principal questions of ontology include:
                                                "What can be said to exist?"
                                                "What is a thing?"[3]
                                                "Into what categories, if any, can we sort existing things?"
                                                "What are the meanings of being?"
                                                "What are the various modes of being of entities?"
                                        CS
                                            ForAll x, Real(x) > Imagined(x). Assume, Imagined(God) is greatest. Real(God) must be greater.
                                                OR ForAll x, ThereExists y, Real(y) > Imagined(x) where Real and Imagined are functions (rating we give)
                                                OR BReal(x) => BImage(x) (can't claim converse) and Real(x) > Image(x). BImage(God)=True, Image(God) is greatest so BReal(God) => Real(God) is greatest.
                                                OR !BReal(x) => !BImage(x) but BImage(Unicorn)=True and BReal(x)=False (in our minds)- contradiction. 
                                                    Conceive (with hypothetical super-eyes- absolute truth- being of it) of an entity that doesn't exist, can we imagine it
                                                        yes, if it is some combination of attribute values of the world.
                                                        no, if it has attributes which are unprecedented.
                                                Eg- Existence of Spiritual World- Everything we feel need for, exists in world, cosmic manifestation.
                                                    REL In mirage people crave for water cuz feel a need for it
                                                        it exists, we know from experienced in past
                                                        need is constitutional to our being (verifiable by past experience)
                                                    We feel need for unending love, peace, joy (mirage of world), there must be spiritual world.
                                                Why- ForAll x (BReal(x) OR BImagined(x)) and ForAll x (BReal(x) And BImagined(x) => Real(x) > Imagined(x)) where BReal are predicates.
                                                    If sum of total of everything is greater than imagined God, then that sigma is what we call as God.
                                                    I imagine an entity with all humanly attributes at their best. Maybe, there exists no real entity that's greater than imagination.

                            What is systematic?
                            Theory (phylosophy) and Practice (religion)
                                @Listen to teacher- hear theories
                                    Only reading and doing nth- many ppl only old ppl and ladies (entertainment- no implementation)
                                    Armchair speculators- discussing Vedantas with cigarettes in mouth.
                                @Lab- arati, chanting are practices.
                                    Many indians do religion but don't know any philosophy.
                                    Practices with philosophy is sentimentalism.
                            Why
                            How
                            Spirituality is repeatable and predictable like science
                                Shraddha- DYS had faith.
                                Sadhu Sang- teachers and facilitators
                                Bhajan Kriya- Chanting
                                Anarth Nivritti- unwanted things gone
                                    so many mental ailments, hypertension, smoking, drinking, prosti, drugs in clg
                                    clg don't give pat for spirituality- e1 doing, you also do. Character motivation is diffl
                                Nishtha- Deep rooted faith.
                                ruci- great taste
                                asakti- more understanding of God
                                Bhaav- great love of God
                                Prema- pure love
                                    get to see God face to face.
                            <WhoIsGod>

                                Religions intersect
                                    Jesus never said I am God (son of God)
                                    Muhammed never. servant of God.
                                    Krishna said he is God- any1 can claim but gotta prove also
                                Proven in his time
                                    showed UF (in BG)- trembling Arjuna. Friend to what extra ordinary.
                                    6 Ops of God
                                        SSS yat yad vibhutimat sattvam...
                                        any 1 of 6 opulences- special talent- sachin's six, beauty, etc
                                        only small spark of my splendor
                                        world is not just flotsom and jetsam (floating earth and water)
                                            we find opulence here- strength, riches, etc
                                        Krishna showed all these ops
                                            showed brahmand in his belly.
                                SSS

                                        if we can create, can't God come and design world without chisel and hammer.
                                        He has energies to create for him- under my supervision he says.
                                    My will- created and destroyed again and again
                                        why created- jiva desire to enjoy.
                                        @child tells mother I will cook- not edible by anyone. Just experiement with role.

                                            "Newton!"- Newton didn't create it- discovered it.

                                        class representative, clg's general secretary, PM, etc
                                        but Krishna is supreme controller- when not controlled by anybody (others are)
                                        he has no beginning and is beginning of eth. cause of all causes.

                        Science is based on observation and logic to establish truth values.
                        Spirituality is based on accepting revelation. Logics can be employed to establish the truth value.

                        Danger of misguided science
                            Martin Luther King- We have guided missiles, misguided men- is science bringing peace or disaster?
                                Vedic time fights- battles not in middle but outskirts
                                weaklings of society protected- women, olds, cows, brahmanas, children.
                                Now, angry with country, blasts in trains, railway stations, crowded places, temples.
                                    Eg- Sankat Mochan mandir in varanasi
                            Theories are modified and updated, like napkins but misguide people while they are believed into dangerous actions.
                                "What is goal of life" is not accomodated in scientific jurisdiction.
                                Extensions of defense mentality- manifests as advanced claws and teeth- bombs, etc
                                    we fly like butterfly, swim like fish. Problem is can't walk like humnas- pollution, fears, etc
                                    ?Should be- if you want peace then be prepared for war.
                                    ?@Knife of science/ technology can be best used if you know how to best use them => Spirituality.

                                    Good but not sufficient
                                        Can fish be happy with laptops.
                                Technical advancement equated to scientific advancement.

                        @Lame and Blind together- Einstein- Spirituality is lame without science and science is blind without spirituality (no vision)
                            no purpose, values
                            like we study NDE, OBE, etc- using science for spiritual concepts
                                we present spirituality very systematically.
                            SP- Indians are ppl sitting on diamond throne- begging for broken glasses.

                    which energy can't work independently- material energy.
                        spirit can manipulate matter- so is superior to matter.
                            REL how stool was made- wood was used to construct it after plant's natural death.
                    Examples for great operator
                        computer machine- sth pressed, sth happens
                        mechanical engr- automatic (operator has set in advance)
                        plane- doesn't move without pilot.
                        so cosmic machine- gigantic brain of universe. Einstein didn't create his brain.
                    Operator of cosmic machine vs local machine- who's superior

                        seed, rain- then agriculture
                        vs Once no rains in Pune- we will bring artificial rains. It means blow clouds and bring above city of Chennai- silverlined it
                            few droplets fell.
                            Artificial rains, no grains, real pains
                        ID- wind, water, sun all dead- how dead things combine to produce effect of rain- on which living entities are so dependent?
                            10 miles radius close- but no rain even if airplanes pass thru them.
                            Jivas also can't create rain, grain, etc but God has given eth.

                            @If material things cud act on their own- why my kurta doesn't get washed and dried and sit in my cupboard.
                            @Iron filings moving- cuz magnet behind scene moving them- automatic but orchestrators don't know
                            #@Parents hold the key- willing to give eth but under their control.
                            #God given mango seed- we may transform but can't produce.

                                Eg- Oceans swell, earthquakes, tsunami, Desert Lands growing, battle deaths
                                Eg- 1 M children killed in womb; growing industries/exploitation, cow slaughter.

                                    Why population increasing?
                                        Liberate and BTG- population will reduce- some from hellish, some from heaven, some evolution so increasing.
                                        @10th class ppl fail but 9th class ppl also join- popu rises.
                                    TEACHING Avoid redundancy in Camp Lectures- if basics are not clear- arrange them rather than changing the platform.
                                        You didn't attend DYS5- who is your facilitator? Vivek Pr, plz explain to him- if don't follow I will explain.
                                    Actions => Range of freewill
                                        @cow tied to pole- if devotee of God, free will grows (more resources allotted)
                                        @Obedient- parent give more money- even give bank account in your name- knowing you will not misuse it.

                                    Who's the doer
                                    We desire, God permits, Material nature make things move on
                                        Eg- smoke cigar, material nature arranges.
                                        Eg- go to temple- God arranges thru material nature.
                                        Destiny- 
                                            from past life- good parents, good profession, enough to eat, healthy body
                                                but result of our choices only.
                                                paap- ugly, legal implications, illiterate, etc.
                                            But how you will use the money is not destined- that's free will.
                                            TEACHING Metadata- See, I will explain you. Make it relatable- you have a bank account?
                                            @Past karma is like Bank account- Sukh-dukh is liquid cash. Acting based new salary you get- is it clear?

                                                If you have human body, then must enquire AT- refer scriptures- Vedanta starts "Therefore..."- cuz humans will open book not cats.
                                                    Many ways to learn what is good/ bad- hearing or experiencing, etc
                                                        eg- Cigar is injurious to health- some turn the wrapper, some died with cigar in mouth.
                                                    God in your heart- then he will guide you to somewhere- where your questions will get answered.

                                                Let thy will be done not mine (Surrender)
                                                    @do anything with money- but son says- what do you want me to do?
                                                        vs Father sends money to college stud but smoke cigar- better focus on studies.
                                                    Obey God and get more freedom.
                                                    Giving Suffering in Love- pinch or slap is also a form of love.
                                                Why confusion in the world?
                                                    don't see the truth- someone can show you.
                                                    So attend such camps- Thank you! brilliant!

                                                If someone is blind, what fault? If murdered in last life, what is fair treatment to him?- Who knows?
                                                    Murder is like 4 subjects- fail! College also restricts you attending classes if 4 subjects fail.
                                                    Someone in lungi does murder but changes clothes- police will still catch him- soul has body as cloth.
                                                    Lame, blind, etc are cuz of past life- how karma comes try to understand? Can't we punish in this 1 life?
                                                        He will improve himself- he will reform!
                                                        Poverty in not in india but everywhere.
                                                        Every soul is child of God- God doesn't act in unfair way.
                                                        Mere data ke darbar mein sab logon ka khaata- jisne jitanaa jamaa karayaa utana hi phal paata
                                                        We get results of what we sow- as you sow, so shall you reap!
                                                        How do you know he has done sth wrong? I have Malaria- what's proof that mosquito bit me? which mosquito!?
                                                            Indian standard time- what time it bit me?
                                                            I will give you proof- 1 Lakh 85 thousand- how much?
                                                            There is instant karma- Slap answered- You contemplate my answer, your question will be answered.
                                                            While I answer if you prepare for your next question, then you can't be answered
                                                            Generally I don't want to talk from egoistic platform.
                                                            Egoistic platform- we are in the mood of defeating each other. That never helps- honestly want to know Lord- you will get answer- answer should be heard attentively.
                                                            I am speaking on behalf of Guru, Sadhu, Shastra- I am giving answer for it- please hear it.
                                                            Remote karma- when eat pizza and stomach upset. Don't study in sem, flunk in exam.
                                                            College days- not good grades then no placements make you suffer.
                                                            Saved no money, when you suffer w/o money? Old age! Suffering instantly or 2-3 months or old age.
                                                            If there is quota of suffering to come, but die (prarabdha)- this balanced karma is aprarabha karma.
                                                            What we get is balance of pleasure and pain (1 package pain we can't bear)- so combination is arranged for future lives.
                                                                Chapatti atta we make gola for roti- so sanchit karma we finish off in lifetimes- 1 1 gola- pure suffering we can't tolerate- so combinatin is givento us.
                                                            Suffering will reduce as a devotee- obey God, sufferings are burnt out.
                                                            @Those who didn't do Homework, she was beating- 1 had approached teacher in advance admitting that guests had come so culdn't- no beating!
                                                                So our karma can be burnt off. Every moment we have chance to act aptly or not aptly- is it clearer now? Keep coming to classes- it will be more clearer.
                                                                why not whole college come for sankalpa not interested? It's not having a soul (in a pocket), you are the soul (not good, bad soul)
                                                                we have good dog, bad dog inside us- 1 we feed gets stronger- good and bad tendencies- how many agree?
                                                                We are destroying bad side- cancer cells dying off. Healing cells growing!
                                                            Observation of scientists- Does company give car to eb- trainer doesn't get car, project lead gets a car after couple of years.
                                                                nature sees tendency to become KC- facilities are given. Company car to take gf for roaming- may be taken away.
                                                                Suicide is like breaking the car- then also car is taken away. It's like mishandling God given gift.
                                                                Human life and doing all kind of dirty things- ploughing field takes tractor- get buffallos body.
                                                                You are fortunate, must maintain the fortune.
                                                                Last life you must have done sth so cultivating KC from there.
                                                                It's cumulative total from last life for spiritual- material life- takes to big height and drops you- again baba black sheep..
                                                                    baby comes grabbing tendency and old dying man- open palms.
                                                            Negative energy- asuras and daivi shaktis the tendencies exist!
                                                                BG in room- ghosts run away- virtue and vice. good and bad.
                                                                Vishnu and Krishna- are they same person. who is source of other- home in lungi is same person
                                                                To create, destroy- Shankh and lotus for devotees. chakra and gada for demons.
                                                                    @army person- cap, dress and gun eth.

                                                            Souls are unique in quality but are unique- God and souls are sac cid ananda.
                                                                @how all of our faces are different. Soul can't be cut by sword, moistened by water.
                                                                Spiritual world and material world- 1 session we talk about spiritual world. You missed it.
                                                                We have relationships in material world. Sent to world to reformation- Life is not so bad
                                                                    can we eat more than 10 gulab jamun- suzuki bike fast they drive to impress and come under lorry.
                                                                    young boy can get accidents, health probs- heart attack. trapped in body can't be very happy.
                                                                    Pune we live- will be like to live in present state or yarawada jail- more expression of spontaneity- ruffians in jail to cause trouble
                                                                        that's difference of material world and spiritual world- what is really worth it.
                                                                        even during life, we have pains- devotees don't say pain- but are law abiders in the pain- such gentleman- so taken from C class jail to B class to A- typing for prison (mgmt)
                                                                        It's not pessimism but realism- world has suffering is reality and even solution exists.
                                                                        Wake up sleeping souls- the boon of ever lasting bliss awaits you. Upanishad- uthistha prapya varam nibodhita.
                                                                        I always wanted to do this- full time. I like it- believe it.
                                                                        Sarve Janah sukhino bhavantu- God also doesn't want us to suffer- we want to suffer.
                                                                        I give you money allowance- don't purchase sweet with flies around but we do mischief and get fever.
                                                                        Sinful activities and good activities reward this and next life. If death came in betw then records kept for next year.
                                                                            If compartment then go to next sem and have to clear this also.
                                                                        Chemical origin- chemicals come from living body.
                                                                        Disease of scientists- won't accept vedas- this is disease.

                Carry this stick around the city- he religiously did that- at death bed, pass on the stick to another murkha- handed stick to the king.
                    @That's how ppl live life- doing things for sake of doing- without evaluating if it is futile in the face of long term future.
                We gonna die but run after material stuff- come outta reincarnation cycle.
                Why Bother life beyond death- busy in current life?
                    Pleasure analysis
                        Worldly delights
                            Don't get it- hankering
                                Eg- won kingdoms but still not satisfied in himself.
                            Get it- not as desired (lamentation), maintenance (anxiety of retaining pleasure), wanna increase/more (hankering)
                            still can't run away from
                                why? we do have desires.
                                how? while doing your duties, don't give up feet of God.
                        Real pleasure- is different from shadow.
                            It's the real home- how comfortable you feel there. constitutional for the soul
                                REL When you go home, you feel very comfortable- relatives praise you and parents talks. others home not very comfortable.
                                REL Birds also return home in even.
                            Taking care of porche car but not of driver
                                people rarely talk about soul- but fuss on mind, body, intellect
                                ppl committing suicide- US- 1200/day commit suicide and 20% successful.
                                It's cuz ppl don't know the goal of life- now dead end of life- now nth else- freedom from probs they think- more troubles start.
                                Philosophy of science- what is goal of life- why doing research? why making gadgets
                                    comforts => happy and nth more.
                    But preoccupied with immediate problems
                        Waiting for waves to stop?- study and then job- more responsible- wanna take care of them.
                        Spiritual goals compromised- In old age many ppl watch TV- interest doesn't come all of a sudden.
                            @If you don't save money now- problems later on.
                        Busy- e1 has 24 hrs- balance accordingly- take out some time for spiritual life.
                Is it not our responsibility to give education in place of food in slums
                    if we do that we will be distracted and won't be able to give what we stand for- spiritual welfare.
                    Best things we can do to a child is connecting him back to his father.
                        You give food, cloth- he continues to cry- the basic need is not being addressed.
                        there is dearth of social welfare organization- then why prasad- open an avenue to take interest. Kirtans, prasadam and Let them invoke an interest to hear.

                    Supreme controller/ Proprietor
                        How Krishna is supreme controller?
                            Prakriti is not independent of Krishna
                                    daivi hi esha gunamayi.
                                    maya is police but govt is in control.

                            supreme controller- difficult- Krishna is too simple. Vishnu so many universes.
                                    it's misfortune.
                                    Brahma saw dahi bhaat in Krishna's hands- searching for boys- you are my supreme father, but so deceptively simple.
                                            even brahma was amazed.

                                        Soul is uncomfortable.
                                            @Healthy person happy but when gets a disease becomes morose, spirit soul contacted by disease of BV is morose
                                                Oxymoron- is healthy person happy or morose?
                                                    Diseased person may also have some moments of pleasure (laugh on a joke) but general state is that of dissatisfaction.
                                                    Healthy person may have moments of pleasure (from lower enjoyments), but general state is that of dissatisfaction from spritual plesure's standpoint.

                                Using BG, for ego gratification- patent stealing and masquerading as your content- is still not all that bad cuz the word spread is KC. Of course, 
                                wrong person gets credit and love and gratitude which would have helped the reader grow in love for Krishna.
                                It's a demoniac tendency. To be ungrateful and stealing.
                                stealing credit in real life!? 7 did it and I am taking credit!!

                                        Distributing fruits thru basket- finished then come along to reservoir.
                                            some of them backed out.
                                            some of them lied down.
                                            oasis- water body- coconut- is it the place- some thirsty- drank water and climbed coconuts.
                                            sun tolerated- for more fruits- cooling breeze. You have reached.
                                            Tall wall- climb- get to other side and trees variety- offering in plates- eat AMAP.

                                                fruits- procs of DS; different rasas of sp world (mango is heavenly food); 
                                                DS- easily give up DS (eg- movie, party, smoke-drink) cuz param drishtva.
                                                came back- succumbing to temptations.
                                                    ashraddhana purush (9.3)- faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection.

                                                    anything bad is also for my protection (sent by Krishna)- 5$ ed to child- heir (all property to you).

                                                        not allowed to be best- we will get 2 extra horns to enjoy (ppl display- not enough to be that inside)
                                                        chocolate adamant- teeth gone or will be- so denied.

                                                        mischief is seen and gives troubled (using ur reactions)
                                                        troubled in DS are Krishna's creation- being destroyed.
                                                        Ramayan- tava asmi then all reactions.

                                                    Big gate- sp world (SM has key)
                                                    how will I find out- I will find you out (you are ISKCON)
                                                        short interview also- name of das vs orissa ka raaja.
                                                        why enter in sp world? to serve.
                                                        hari guru vaishnav- for eternity.
                                        What was differentiating factor?
                                            Shraddha (komal vs staunch) causing the following
                                                Abhidheya not proper- officially engaged- doing out of sense of duty (not by heart)
                                                    @marriage heartily vs formality type- giving heart- taking services.
                                                Prayojan not proper- hidden motives (hidden cuz if exposed it will be disapproved)
                                                    not wrong in beginning
                                                        Eg- 7 evening programs- to save from cooking.
                                                        Eg- send me to abroad- international movement or employment.
                                                        Eg- good marital match here.
                                                        Eg- To RSP- How to get into IIT?
                                                    but purify else won't last.
                                                    !Eg- Devahuti- bathe, ornaments, herbal oils- perverted reflection of shampoo.
                                                        how will I get delivered?
                                                        3.23.57- material side- good marriage, clarifications, etc. I never asked for liberation.
                                                            why? getting to see futility of material desires in front of Krishna.
                                                            Dhruva M also.
                                                        Maharaj I am a baby. Grow up! can't expect 16 yr old to be lifted by mother.
                                    Division of devotees on faith
                                        1st class dev- know shastra, can quote and faith like trunk of a tree.
                                            no chance of fall down (nitya siddha, sadhana siddha)
                                            At least Nishtha stage is attained.
                                        2nd- don't know scriptures but firm faith that it's best course.
                                            nice movement- I will give heart.
                                            Diffl time falling down.
                                            inclined for mundane welfare activities.
                                            madhyam adhikaris are greater than this level.
                                        3rd- doesn't have faith (not scriptures very well)
                                                but due to association and simplicity (complicated brains)- so hangs around (follow up)

                                        different angles of vision of same thing- why so.
                                                analyse to make it sync- evaluate, think more (than reading more pages)
                                                absorption is more important.
                                        Eg- Narad, Shiva- facing probs in life
                                                should be very careful in life.
                                                demigods enjoy and probs do arrive.
                                                vs even they can't handle- how can I?
                                        vs demons chase after illusion.

                                    See world from others' perspective.
                            People who have supernatural reflections- expound on it- they are the teacher- sects emerge from there- 
                            Getting eyes back- Caksu daan.

                    <MMN>aka Guna =>Nirguna.
                    You are in this MMN when-
                        MOG
                            knowledge (you see reality the way it is-science,yoga), and act in that knowledge.
                                (REL sat- "what it is"- Jo hai- to see things as they are!)
                                cuz aligned no PAp and happiness. Prob- attachment to that happiness.
                                you use it to serve others (technology) by conditioning nature or environment.
                                Is conditioning not done for the purpose of gratification? Making it MOP? Service vs you want it for yourself- "what drives for action? knowledge!"
                            Fulfillment (making ecosystem of normal gratification(enjoyment) or analgesics) within quota is acceptable.
                                Here gratification is not so much on material layers. It is satisfaction of giving, love, daan; I made a difference- satisfaction.
                                    Enjoyment not in "I" but "made a difference"- independent "I" still exists, though.
                        MOP
                            attachment and hankering drives you. Gratification/Enjoyment is your objective.
                            The purpose of studying reality is to enjoy objects of gratification (not escape reality but accept reality)
                            Hanker for best gratification->work hard to get those objects.
                                    Eg- Ego gratification!
                                    REL rajas- royalty- "I am the king" feel.
                        MOI
                            Escape reality thru intoxication, oversleep, excitement time, etc
                                REL tamas- andhakaar- darkness. Don't show me light, reality- things as they are (cuz they suck maybe)
                            Why MOI? Karma but no phala makes one sick- I wasted my time.
                                Time is never wasted- you might have climbed up to 39% so continue from there- tapa pays and what else is option?
                                1 starts to hate hard work that it doesn't pay him up to his expectations. So, starts to hack into pleasure.
                                No! above all pleasing Krishna.
                        
                        1. Sattva – intelligence, imparts balance

                        2. Rajas – energy, causes imbalance

                        3. Tamas – substance, creates inertia


                        An environment is in a MMN when it stimulates corresponding emotions.
                        BKVS- Castes map to MMN. Sync with reality and pursuit.
                        MOI-core, animal,  plants-humans on other hand have to keep some track of reality.
                        Associate with the mode or people in that mode to cultivate that mode- Varnashram assists in this.

                            KC is a marathon- is built on a platform- platform just gives a stable atmosphere for the practice to fructify.
                            why detachment?
                                to give DS whole heartedly.
                                uncondusive atmosphere- prajalpa and bhakti to arise- doesn't happen.

                                    different inclinations accomodated- 7th canto- PDS vs VA (gradual purification)
                                    fragile bodies don't know how long we will live.
                                    my aspirations take me to next body.

                                        comes at the cost of responsibilities.
                                        give 25% of energy for husband wife, children raising, etc.
                                        75% for PDS.

                        We live in the world of cause and effect. Spiritual world is not in terms of cause and effect (panch-bhoot) undergo transformation here.

                                    If I don't, I put myself into suffering.
                                    MOI causes Degradation.
                                Desire
                                    You can fulfill your desires. Karma is a means to get there.
                                    You cultivate Seva Vritti from Bhog Vritti. @Salt in Sabji- Get Bhog but no bondage.
                                Duty
                                    VA is culture of India. Important enough spending one's life on.
                                        Society is doing so much for us. Gratitude- my time to pay my debts (of course, it is formal and no informal concern for oneself but participate in this mutual game)               	
                                    Krishna has advocated so in BG. It's MOI vs MOG.
                                Love            
                                    I can do anything +with my time- all time for SQ if I want.
                                        shastras don't approve of it. samaj can't run like this.
                                        Your nature needs engagement and service is your human need
                                    Will it please Krishna if I do brilliant and dovetail vs I ignore rather than not doing it in first place.
                                        Fear desire duty love- when disapproved by envt makes sure that you take shelter of SQ- why you doing it at all.
                                            helps you reflect on your vision/purposes. Connecting you back to your roots.

                            Context - Mood of SP, Things b4 book
                                    Scene
                                            first wrote SB 1st canto - sent to govt and respectable people and positive remarks from there
                                            BTG ppl started doing.
                                            BG
                                                    not famous author so plight. 
                                                    mcmillan - a clerk wanted BG for himself. 
                                                    Big guy - published all scripture but don't have hindu. 
                                                    long process then went thru it quite fast - 400-500 books hayagriva Pr cut short.
                                            Positive reviews from scholars also - SP started his own press - ISKCON press and BBT. That's what SP talks about.
                                    No purports earlier (Just to finish their collection)
                                    Original gives authentic, scholarly - on increasing demand.
                            Credits go to SM - originator being K (Credits / ACK)
                                    My credit is no adulteration - no personal ambition.
                                            vs personal agenda or ambitions.
                                                    Imperfect knowledge - put Krishna aside (banish, kill Krishna ??? asuri vritti) => bewilderment from mayavad => not enabled to btg.
                                            present will of Krishna - not scientific, political, philosophical treaty.
                                            Eg - become my devotee - Krishna and inside of Krishna - no difference (not a human assumption)
                            Purpose
                                    the one why Krishna descends
                                            accept else why read. Understand as Arjuna did (Proof!) => Profitable for society in human life (personal)
                                            enumerate Principles of life - science to be read in our interest
                                                    vs Demons put forth their propensities and mislead.
                                                    BG doesn't talk hinduism - universal truths
                                                    perfect life by making perfect solution to problems of life.
                                                    saves 1 from greatest fear.
                                                            SSS trayate mahato bhayat.
                                            Success if even 1 person become PD thru efforts. 
                                                    Not purpose but what importance 1 has. 
                                                    Confidence [in Krishna and transparency] - It implies that the book has that potential in it - hopefully someone can avail it.
                                                    Mood - 1 person becomes PD - that's SP's goal - not to become famous scholar, author - fulfill purpose of Krishna.
                                    Sambandh
                                            How God is great
                                            position of jivas
                                            relationship jivas and Krishna - 
                                                    serve Krishna being happy part and parcel 
                                                            vs illusion in 3 MMN (for personal SG) => cycle of birth and death (process in different forms)
                                                    So, Krishna demands it!!
                                                    applies to speculators as well.
                            How
                                    Challenges - Kali - enamored by external energy - comforts => happiness
                                            strongly bound by material energy.
                                            SP Mood - current reality to scriptural reality suddenly 8.4 million years ago
                                    Take help of KC movement in understanding BG and deriving full benefit
                                            KC - 
                                                    natural, trans, 
                                                    popular 
                                                            among youth.
                                                            old also - thanks and gratitude as USA.
                                                                    accepted by all - hippies were alarming phenomenon - rebelled against USA stood for ..wanting sth more than material prosperity - turning to drugs and SP says many parents come to me.

                    <Introduction>
                            <About>
                                    was written with book
                                    directly focussed on content. Whole introductory philosophical nutshell.
                                    Only reference to Radharani in prayers in beginning.
                                    Style of Presentation
                                            SP in Intro - analysis - taking things separate 
                                                    analysis is for clarity of understanding and for functioning we need synthesis.
                                            Krishna's synthesis - how these points are connected together.
                                                    @ Newspaper - make it look like flow. Cricket and sw accident.
                                                    Scriptures present knowledge as synthesis mode - child is not taught as grammar basics, etc but culture.
                                                            BG is synthetic body of knowledge - acaryas give us analytic foothold.
                                    Importance in our context (KC ecosystem)
                                            BG is broad scriptural book - integrated paths talked about to declare supremacy of bhakti.
                                    Importance in Tradition
                                            LCM quotes a lot.
                                            Jiva quotes.

                                                    wrote commentary after VCT - disciple doesn't write unless has a purpose.
                                                            Eg - BSS on CC - SP also - same message - instruction to devs and additions in there.
                                                    not wrong if context requires.

                                                            commentary on shruti, smriti and nyaya - several upanishads, BG, Vedanta Sutra by BV.
                                                    VCT is more rasika in many natures and Baladev mainly on philosophical tenets of sampraday.
                                            BVT wrote commentaries - added notes at several places - Vidvata ranjan (Delight in wise based on BV), rasika ranjan(relishers of mellows).
                                            SP wrote commentary - mainly from Baladev. Repeats and emphasizes how bhakti is essence.

                                    Why
                                            Deliver Mankind from nescience of material existence
                                                    Arjuna's difficult position
                                                            being associate is above ignorance 
                                                            for future generations chalk out plan of life - act acc and perfect
                                                    e1 is in difficult position
                                                            atmosphere of nonexistence (asat- which doesn't exist)
                                                            our constitutional identity not to be threatened by nonexistence.
                                                    But not e1 does brahma jijnasa
                                                    this is so important that every activity is failure unless brahma jijnasa.
                                            Gita Mahatmya - what will happen
                                                    no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.
                                                    free from shoka and misery
                                                    sinful reactions go away

                                                    SPOG himself spoke - why we need anything else
                                                            others SB are just elaborations.
                                                            attentive and regular.
                                                            ganga came from Lord's feet and BG from lips - no difference but more important.

                                                            cuz so absorbed in mundane activities that not possible to read all vedic literatures
                                                            BG will suffice - has the potential.
                                    When is BG spoken
                                            Disciplic succession but got lost so speaking to reestablish
                                            and thus Arjuna becomes an authority in understanding
                                    Why Arjuna is chosen
                                            devotee and friend
                                                    ensures submissive spirit and following prescriptions else armchair enjoyment.
                                                    meant for devotee
                                                            types of relationships
                                                            Arjuna himself says difficult to understand Krishna
                                                    friendship - obtained thru DS - revival of svarupa.
                                                            vs mundane

                    It seems like an instance of Vritti. Vritti is something that exists potentially between consciousness and object of perception but keetam is push exercised in real time.
                    It is not feeling - but feelings intensify to culminate into Thinking It and influencing the other layers - arranging for gratification!!

            Dhyan - meditative state, one in which it is no longer possible to perceive the act of meditation or separate a sense of self from it.

                                material knowledge from shastra can come under this. So, J can be in alignment with shastra or disaligned - not by correctness but by purose it serves.
                DY - cultivating absorption thru practice on transcendence
                        D - absorption in object of your interest.
                                thinking about what is suggested to you to think (by shastra or guru)
                BY - rendering devotional service to Godhead.
                        B - devoted to a cause.
                                devoted to causes deemed respectable by shastra.
                KJDB are necessary for life - you are in desert - so stop working will only make you suffer more.
                        what's needed is directing KJDB towards the direction of coming out of desert while continuing with KJDB of life - more as util than goal.
                        REL gotta go to restaurant. Gotta ensure the car is full tank petrol and air is fine, etc.
                        where's the hint for God? And where's the incentive to start considering it 
                                BG says 
                                        DaaS (Devotion as a Service)
                                                arto (trouble - who is out there to orchestrate or can anyone orchestrate solution beyond me), 
                                                artharti - what's the gain, opportunity, benefit here - It helps me materially and the promises in milestones are good bets (Shikshastakam)
                                                        also the wordly side - like I give presentations, my stage confidence will get better.
                                        Exploration
                                                jijnasa - what is it anyways. Curious. Explore this dimension. 
                                                        End result is not known but want the experience the road (not fruit but work) - what's the world view model.
                                                jnani (the model wins you) - it's consistent, intriguing, sensible, verifiable (in milestones of achievers).
                                                        sounds like when you are done with exploring and then find it interesting to go on.
                                                Experiences
                                Ascend - too much of KJDB takes you to the essence (doesn't align but shows)
                                        In all of KJDB - In J aarohan (shastra being a consistent and dependable model ;  ) you can find, in K, D (eth being tailor made), B. 
                                        Proof of pudding is in eating and seeing other examples of successful and shastra, etc.
                                        Yoga Ladder - Increase in services make you temperament suitable to see beyond the grats of life and sobriety necessary to realize the Spirituality model at work.
		Yama - self/avoids/free yourself from lower/mundane expressions that cause mental agitation. Things that spoil the environment for execution. @pouring water into fire.
                Satya - avoid illusion (creating or experiencing)
                Ahimsa - avoid anger (u and 7)
                Asteya - avoid envy/jealosy (karmic bondage)
                    REL a bargaining with richest man on earth - it can't be equivalent exchange
                        thievery mentality comes in vendor (pretend or make up charges - thievery/cheating)
                        I want him to pay more cuz he can. He has so much - I should also have some (jealosy)
                Brahmacarya - avoid lust (of all senses)
                Aparigrah - avoid greed (MSC - Minimum Simple Clean)
        Niyam - preparation or setting the environment for execution (configuring the property files in a software application)
                Shauch - Body Environment
                Santosh - Mind Environment
                Tapa - Intellectual Environment
                Svadhyaya - Ego Environment
                Ishwar Pranidhan - Spiritual Environment
        Yoga - you are within this world cuz of bandhan
                Bandhan exists at all the layers -
                        senses clamor for grats,
                        mind wants to be free,
                        intellect conditioned to plan enjoyments (or find enjoyment in planning, execution or achievement)
                        ego conditioned with worldly identifications
                Yoga means to purify all the 4 layers - yes, it takes all layers to be purified.
                        DY - purify the mind - change the engagement from external to internal.
                        JY - purify the intellect - thru knowledge from nth to a proper un-corrupt kernel
                        BY - purify the ego - change from wordly identifications to spiritual identifications
                        KY - purify the senses (the desire to enjoy the fruits thru senses) - let fruits pass thru the channel of Lord for fruit to become prasad and work to become sadhana.
                                where's the bondage - not in desire, not in work, not in deserve, not in fruit. Bondage is in the desire to enjoy the fruit independently.
                                Desire --> Karma --> Deserve --otherfactors--> Fruit.
                                How good is philanthropy - it is good karma for sure. but is it akarma or even helps akarma?
                                        good karma means that it is a higher expression of engagement (say, demigodly) - from oneself to others.
                                                in its new state - you may still want a reciprocation from people (law of equivalent exchange)
                                                but if say no expectation of reciprocation - satisfied in the service alone OR the happy faces you give - for now, this doesn't seem worldly
                                                        this can be accomodated in spiritual world but your attraction is once again not for Krishna but worldly happiness so maybe Brahman is right for you.
                                        but it's not intended to invoke love for God so how can it even get you there.
                                Misconceptions - don't worry about fruits focus only on endeavor - why endeavor at all then? cuz in love with the work. then fruit is in the endeavor not outta endeavor.
                                        this is higher expression of engagement where driving force of endeavor is the sheer love for it - eg pleasure of solving a trigonometry problem (FDDL)
                                                here the expression has moved from my mental pleasure to my intellectual pleasure - it is still worldly.
                                        is there any bandhan here or no bandhan - yes, bandhan here is not by fruit outta endeavor but fruit within the endeavor - you can't leave the engagement cuz of love.
                                        bandhan is not in desire cuz soul desires all the times it is only stone that doesn't desire.
                                                bandhan is by definition in perverted expression of this resource called desire (expression of consciousness within this world)
		</Yoga>
		<KY>
        Karma Yoga - everything offered to Krishna then taken else thief. Done as an offering and fruit is consumed as prasad.
                the whole concept of karma bandhan is addressed by Karma Yoga.
                Eg - offering food to Krishna
                Thievery - intervening into 7 else's life is problem - 7 else's quota.
                        Eg - that body belongs to that guy - so can't exploit his body without his permission - thievery.
                        Loving 7's daughter without permission is thievery

			https://www.thespiritualscientist.com/2013/09/kc-and-world-religions/
			Today’s Topics:
			Why to study various religions?
			Different kinds of religions

			Lecture Topic:

			Studying religion can be done in different levels.

			True spiritual seeking –> For finding which path to follow.

			Intellectual sense gratification –> Study of various paths after knowing and choosing one path.
			Study of KC devotees

			Personal application –> Deepen our appreciation of what we have got.

			Preaching application –> to be sensitive when we are interacting with people of different audience.

			AIM: To see all the religions from a KC perspective.
			Three subdivisions of the study of a religion:

			History –> How it originated and developed

			Primary beliefs
			Interactions with Gaudiya Vaishnavism, if any.

			Primary way of knowing –> Guru, sadhu and shasthra

			Bonafied ways of gaining knowledge: (Krsna says to Uddhava in Uddhava Gita in 11th Canto)

			Shruthi –> what we hear from the spiritual tradition

			Pratyaksha praman
			Itiha –> Historical record

			Anuman –> Inference (term used in positive sense)
			Primary way of knowing –> shruthi
			Before Bhakthi Vinoda Thakhura (BVT) no acharya commented on religion.
			Oral and written traditions were the only way by which the knowledge was passed down at the time of Vishwanath Chakravarthy Thakhura (VCT).
			Books were written is only for scholars
				Therefore when VCT, wrote a book he wrote for scholars only.
			Sambandha Jnana given by books and Abhideya by oral tradition.
			VCT’s commentaries on SMBG and BG contain primarily 3 things:
			He goes into the heart of the seeker and gives the conversations
				(Krsna’s feelings given priority)
			Grammatical Analysis
			Philosophical clarification
			When the living tradition is there, there is no need for practical methods to be given in the books.
			The main religion that confronted to Sanathan was Islam and it was never seen as an intellectual competitor to the sanathan path.
			The Two World Religions:

			Dharmic Religions –> Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism
				(All have some concept like Dharma, an underlying order to the universe exists (order may vary in religion))
			Abrahamic Religions –> Judaism, Christianity, Islam
				(Accept Abraham as their first Prophet)
			Geographically the Dharmic religions evolved from India.
			KC has Achintya Beda – Abeda relation with Hinduism.
			Abrahamic religions are founded (started) and Propounded (spread) primarily by prophets.
			Fundamental Difference Between Prophets and Rishis:

			Prophets

			Rishis

			Messengers who convey the instructions of god

			Individuals who consciously sort the spiritual

			Not a life based on “conscious search for spirituality”

			Life style focused on attaining transcendental truths and hence had strict sadhana

			Hence no stress on systematic study of philosophy

			Philosophy has good significance

			Judaism

			Starts with Adam and Eve.
			Satan –> Snake
			The Garden Of Eden story.
			Similarities of Satan and Maya:
			Both tempt the soul away from God.
			Differences:
			Satan	Maya
			Satan is independent entity independent from god	She is one of expansions of Radha Rani
			Satan is seen as enemy to god	Maya is servant of god
			Adam and Eve seen as the only living entities when they fell, and everyone else have descended from them.
			They had done the “Original Sin”
				Their sin is passed down through all the generations.
			Their idea is that sin is a genetic defect passed from generation to generation.
			Jesus thought of as the son of god, so he can’t be sinful
				But if he was born of a union, then he should have the sins of Adam and Eve
				This lead to the concept that Mary gave birth to a child, but as a Virgin (But this is not mentioned in bible ).
			Fails to explain why some people suffer less and some suffer more.
			Historically the Jews become active at the time of Moses (Founder of the religion)
			They were held captive in Egypt when Moses, through a series of events escapes the prison and gets a calling from God that he has to be the Prophet.
			God -“You will take the people out and I’ll take you to the promised land (Today’s area of Israel)”
			God considered as remote and inaccessible
			He interacts in two ways:
			Instructions to the prophet
			Supernatural events (Example of ‘Trapped between the devil and the sea’)
			This continued through the chain of prophets (none of them are serious spiritual seekers)
			All came towards Jerusalem, but before reaching the city Moses died.
			So from the hope that they will attain the full glory (as promised by god) lead to the idea that “In future a Prophet will come and will fully deliver us to the promised land”
				(A Messiah will come in future)
			LOOKING FROM KC PERSPECTIVE:
			No direct interaction with god anywhere
			No systematic philosophy
				(They felt, philosophy is ‘Abstract, Otherworldly, Uncertain and Debatable’)
			All the Prophets in the line got some messages from god and there are some supernatural events which are recorded, all formed the basis for ‘The Old Testament‘
			The Old Testament (TOT) has very few words of god
				Primarily has the actions of god (that too god is not a person)
			God is a supernatural force about to burst into reality but never bursted out
			TOT is neither Shruthi nor Smrithi (since it is a record of god’s incarnations)
			When Jesus arrived, some of them thought that Jesus is the Messiah that was promised, but when crucified then some of them begun to question because Jesus was crucified
			Jews	Christians
			Jesus is not the Messiah	Jesus is the Messiah
			REASON: “He couldn’t deliver himself”	REASON: “He delivered us by sacrificing himself”
			Jesus lived and died like a Jew, his teachings being Jewish
				But after his death, his followers started a new religion.
			HISTORICAL SENSE: ‘Christianity is subset of Judaism’
			PRACTICAL SENSE: Number of Christians are far more than Jews
			Christians made the teachings of Jesus as the ‘The New Testament’
			SP mainly talks about Jesus, not so much mention of Moses
			BVT wrote a book ‘From Moses to Mahaprabhu(MP)’
			Jews	Gaudiya Vaishnavas
			Jesus is the western savior	MP is the eastern savior
			Rasa revelation is less	Rasa revelation is more
			BVT says that the rasa evolved to Madhurya rasa.
			Jews had tremendous influence on world history.
			They are seen as intelligent people at the same time they kept themselves isolated from others.
			They had the idea that ‘God has chosen us to be his messengers, so we have to be protected’
				So they stayed away and never married out of religion
			Christians feel that it was Jews who killed Jesus, hence both the religions don’t have sweet relations.
			When Hitler wanted to kill the Jews, the catholic church gave their full support.
			Jews though small had a great influence as they are very active in the places of influence.
			The point at which the Dharmic and Abrahamic religions evolve is the relationship between God and us.
			Their idea is that God is sacred and this world is profane, hence god never comes in contact with this world.
			This duality is maximum seen in Islam consequence being that they thought ‘God can’t manifest in any material (impure) form’.
			Moses went to the top of a mound and got the ten commandments from God as instructions
				In the meantime, his followers at the bottom melted all the ornaments they had, molded it into a calf and started worshipping it
				When Moses came down with the ten commandments on a stone tablet, he was outraged
				He dropped it down which broke and information was lost
				This enraged him further
				He destroyed the calf and gave punishment to the people
				This lead to the concept to ‘destroy’ any idol found.
			God can’t be represented by any form as he is from other world
				If some idol represents God then it is a false god
				False god is a competitor for the true god
				Our devotion to the true god is proven by destruction of false god.
			So whenever a Jewish king conquered a new kingdom, then the first thing that he would do is to destroy all the idols of that kingdom (which is an act of great virtue)
			Their idea of false gods is that:
			They are ordinary human beings who are made god
			They are manifestations of imaginations of people
			The Abrahamic religions are highly ‘History Centric’ and their insights are ‘not necessarily universal’.
			They lack the philosophy of Deity worship.
			SP says “Both spirit and matter are energy of God and God can switch between them”.
			They essentially say that “The world is so filthy and impure that even God can’t manifest in here” which is an insult to god.
			Their realizations are OK with their religion (as there is lack of philosophy), but they can’t generalize it, as there are religions with far deeper understanding of philosophy.
			How should we view the Abrahamic religion followers?
			We shouldn’t see them as ‘agents of hatred’ but as ‘victims of misconception’

			We have to educate them
				We have to show them that by following our religion we can develop greater love of god
				Then these sectarian boundaries are vanquished.
			SUMMARY:

			Judaism and its history
			How we see other religions
			What our Acharyas have said about these
			Divisions of religion
			Difference between Rishi and Prophet
			Rise of Judaism
			Foundational difference in understanding of God
			Questions and Answers:

			What is the difference between ‘Torah’ and ‘Old Testament’?
			Torah is like our Vedas.
			Vedas can represent to either 4 Vedas or the ‘body of vedic literature’
			Similarly Torah can represent ‘first 5 books of OT’ or ‘OT along with writings of great saints and prophets’
			Why is that Vedic religion couldn’t transform them, if earlier they were connected to Vedic society?
			These religions history doesn’t go very far behind.
			According to literalist Christians (who interpret bible), earth is 6000 years old
				Moses was 3000 years
			Therefore these rulers came up when the influence of Vedic civilization started coming down.
			The Greek philosophy is very similar to Vedic insights.
			Even in Vedic tradition, Lord never gave realizations completely
				He gave different versions according to TPC
				So it is quite possible that outside its realm people developed new ideology.
			Christianity – Part 01

			Religion is characterized by looking backwards.
			Also they have some prophecy for the future
				We live primarily on our memories and hopes.
			But life in material world is never joyful.
			Religion ‘Expands’ and ‘Spiritualizes’ our memories (by sacred events) and hopes (by promises).
			Christianity –> ” In future a Messiah will come and save us from ‘political’ and ‘cultural’ oppression.
			However with Jesus advent and departure the political situation of followers didn’t change much.
			Hence hope was formed that Jesus will come again and reward those who followed his principles, and would make earth the ‘Kingdom of God’.
			SP attitude towards Christians is divided into two categories:

			If someone is a nominal Christian (not so serious), SP would encourage him to practice KC
			If someone is proper follower of Christian, SP would recommend them to follow Jesus properly
				(main emphasis on ‘Thou shall not kill’)
			SP approach was ‘Universality’ and ‘confidentiality’.

			UNIVERSALITY: There is order to the world with God in center, and we have to harmonize our love by loving devotion.

			CONFIDENTIALITY: The detailed description of God, his spiritual dealings etc.
			Jesus lived for about 33 years and was crucified after that.
			From the age of 12 to the age of 29 there is nothing that is known about him.
			DIFFERENT THEORIES:

			Some claim that Jesus came to India
				(SP said in one lecture that Jesus is a worshipper of Jagannath
				There is a book that SP had read namely ‘Aquarian Gospel’)
			SP never quoted anything from Bible because he knew that Christians would never accept him as an authority for bible.
			The ‘Pratisarghaparva’ of ‘Bhavishya Purana(BP)’ is said to have predicted Jesus, but its authenticity is doubtful as the book is said to have been interpolated.
			In BP it is said that King Salyavahan went to the North India where he met a tall, bearded and fair looking who said that :
			I am considered prophet by the ‘Malechas’.
			I have taught them the religion of the worship of ‘Fire and the Sun’.
			I was born of a Virgin.
			My name is ‘Ishah Messiah’
				(Ishah is Vedic name of Jesus).
			Among the four points, first and third are acceptable
				But Jesus as we know never taught the worship of Sun and Fire.
			Also Historically whether Maharaj Salyavahan existed at the time of Jesus is not clear.
			By accepting the fact that Jesus visited India, we might be trying to:
			Prove the universality of the Vedic literature.
			Expansiveness of our Hindu Ego.
			Our Acharyas never commented on the part when Jesus visited India.
			After the end of his 18 years, he started preaching
				At that time the land was under Roman rule.
			When he said that he was ‘Son of God’ some of the Jews told to the king, that he was conspiring a plot politically against the king and for the same reason he was crucified.
			Gospels can refer to ‘Truth revealed by God’ or in narrower sense, they are the four books that talk about the activities of Jesus.
			The four books are:
			Mathew
			Mark
			Luke
			John
			But there some contradictions within the books on the account of life of Jesus Christ.
			Also the acts of The Twelve Apostles are also mentioned
				The letters written by Paul (as he was in charge of vast area of preaching) are given.
			The last book describes the final battle between God and the Satan in which God will kill the Satan and Kingdom of God will be manifested on Earth
				But this revelation became the source of embarrassment to many Christians as many religions show the fear of Dooms day to install religion to people.
			Their belief is that whoever is surrendered to Jesus by the Judgment Day will ‘Eternally’ go to heaven and for those who don’t will eternally go to hell.
			THE TEN COMMANDMENTS: (Old Testament)

			You shall have no other God before me.
			You shall not make for yourself an idol.
			If your Parents deride me, I shall punish them and also the further generations
				(Not the exact statement) –> Shows that God is vengeful and leading further ‘Intellectual Alienation of God’ and hence in the future science was felt more appealing than religion to people.
			You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord
				(Some Christians use this to say that you shouldn’t chant the names of the Lord, and some shouldn’t write the name of the Lord)
			You should honor your mother and father.
			You shall not murder
				(Kill)
			You shouldn’t commit Adultery.
			You shouldn’t steal
			You shouldn’t false witness against your neighbor.
			You shouldn’t covet your neighbor’s house
				You shouldn’t covet your neighbor’s wife.
			Most of it is Mundane morality
				No direct instruction for doing sadhana
				So even the followers are nominally religious, they stay at the material level.
			SP quotes from the gospel Luke “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do”
				SP says that the Bhakthi can be in modes of goodness, passion and ignorance
				Even though Jesus taught worship in love, most of the religions are in the modes of passion and ignorance.
			Moral instructions without god consciousness are impossible to follow.
			Textual Integrity:

			There is a book named ‘The Paradox of Jesus in the Gospels’, where the author Prof
				Charles Smith says that not all the words in the bible are quoted by Jesus Christ.
			‘I am the way, the truth and the light
				No man comes to the father, but by me’ which is often used by the Christians to show their exclusivism
				Most of the Abrahamic religion followers are exclusivists
				So the professor says that this is not spoken by Jesus but interpolated later.
			These kind of contradictions are not found in BG, all the Acharyas have accepted without controversies
				(This topic is not be done as a general discussion but for personal understanding)
			Seven weeks after the passing away of Jesus, all his followers broke down, not understanding how the son of God couldn’t protect himself
				But then some of his followers got the sight of Jesus getting resurrected again and blessed them.
			This made a paradigm shift of ‘We are lost’ to ‘We are blessed as Jesus died for our sins’
				‘So now it is up to us to die for his cause.’ This became critical for the survival of Christianity.
			One of the Twelve Apostles Paul, had taught reformation of the Jew religion conflicting with others, as they thought Jesus to be a Jew
				He shifted the focus from ‘Die for the cause of God’ to ‘Jesus died for our sins’, which is unfortunate.
			Later Peter and Paul were burnt by the king Nero.
			Till 4th century Christians were persecuted
				But after that the roman king Constantine found that his population were largely immoral
				Hence material administration became difficult
				He made Christianity the state religion and it shot up overnight
				Then another misfortunate movement took place
				Christians who were earlier ‘persecuted’ became the ‘persecutors’.
			Till 18th century Pope was considered king of the kings.
			In 10th century the Churches split into two
				‘The Catholic Church’ and ‘The Orthodox Church’.
			Orthodox Church had capital as Constantinople and Catholic Church had capital Rome.
			15th Century another split between Catholic Church (CC) and Protestant Church
			CC wanted to build big churches which required money
				So the pope at that time got the concept of ‘selling indulgences’ which included that God would forgive the sin if Pope was given some money.
			There were some people who revolted against Pope and for 100 years there was a bloody war in Christianity.
			Then CC people moved towards west primarily to NA and SA and Protestants moved to the east to India etc.
			The CC destroyed the culture of NA & SA.
			Later CC came to India also and spread rapidly
			Encounter with Indians:

			The English initially felt that our culture was very abominable culture.
			They had three main criticisms
			Idol worship
			Cast system and the discrimination it caused.
			Polytheism (too many gods)
			They did try for 100 years to change but of little results, because whenever English pointed out the mistakes of Indians, the Indians reformed their philosophy
				(Swami Vivekananda, Raja Ram Mohan Roy etc.)
			Christians got their higher taste primarily in converting other religions into their own, but no higher taste with God.
			So instead of criticizing Hindus, they got up with two new strategies
			Education
			Social service
			They told that Social service the highest form of devotional service evoking the mundane sentiments of the people and confusing them that they were devotional sentiments.
			The Christians have made an impact by showing nice material care.
			So along with philosophy, if we can show the ‘devotee care’ then people accept KC.
			Christianity – Part 02

			In Christian church the central ritual is called the Eukarist
			The night before his crucifying, he had a supper which is called ‘The last supper’, wherein he ate a loaf of bread partially, distributing the remaining to his disciples saying ‘this is my body’ and gives them a cup saying ‘Drink it, this is my blood.’
			What Jesus offered in the cup was unfermented grape juice while now people started offering wine
				This is the closest form of prasad
				The idea is that bread changes from material to spiritual (Transubstantiation).
			Christianity doesn’t have deities
				Since we have the concept of deity, we say we are going for dharshan.
			Distinctive feature of devotion is that we use our senses in Krsna’s service
				If deity worship is not there is not so much rising from material level.
			There is a ‘Call for Humility’ in their religion
				In Mathew it is given:

			“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
			Blessed are those who mourn, for there shall be comforted
			Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”
			These are close to ‘Trnad api sunicena’
			They have the idea that we have to be humble before god
				But if we see their attitude towards other religion, this humility is rarely mentioned.
			A religious thought can be in three categories:

			Exclusivist –> This is the only way

			Pluralist –> There are many ways to god and you can chose anyone

			Inclusivity –> There is one way and there are many levels on that.
			Exclusivist and pluralist are two extremes and inclusivism is like a balance.
			If we take religion as a university

			Exclusivist

			“My college is the only college
				If you didn’t get degree in my college, you aren’t engineer.”

			Pluralism

			“Every building is an engineering college“

			Inclusivism

			“There different means by which we can grade the engineering colleges.”

			We have the classifications based on fear, desire, duty and love.
			Greatest scholar in the Christian tradition was St
				Augustine and he talks about making the top most priority in life
				He was among the first prominent intellectuals in Christian history.
			Bible is mainly stories with some morals
				It is a collection of ‘moral instructions from god’
				They say that God is unknowable and hence we should struggle to follow the will of the lord rather than knowing him
				But if we want to follow the will of the lord, we need to love god and for that reason we need to know him.
			They preach by showing how a bible can make us a better person.
			Greeks beliefs are very similar to Vedic beliefs
				Christians emerged from Arabia and came to Europe
				But by that time the Europeans already had the scholarly beliefs influenced by the Greeks
				Many of the Christian followers thus took the Greek philosophy and blended it with the Gospels
				From that emerged “Christian Theology”
			They later developed the idea of ‘Pre-Christian Christian saints’ where they depicted Plato and other Greek thinkers as Christian saints
			Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are like parampara
				A prominent Christian scholar Thomas Acquenus studied Aristotle.
			Socrates never wrote anything down and what we know of him is through Plato
				Aristotle though was Plato’s student practically never wrote anything down.
			Plato and Socrates mainly underlined the spiritual underlying the material
				But Aristotle’s focus was mainly o particular because he never saw Universal and it is useless time in thinking about it (Focus on material).
			Augustine adopted the “Plato Socrates” tradition while Aquenus adapted “Aristotle” tradition.
			It was further propagated that “God is glorious, but let us concentrate on what we can see”
			This lead to the development of science and beating back of the religion.
			He said “By observing the nature we can say that God is the designer, but we can’t say anything further just by observing the nature.”
			Slowly this lead to rejection of spiritual
				There are several stages

			In 15th century, the Protestants came up saying everyone has direct relation with God and there is no need for a priest to interfere
				But this unfortunately lead to individual interpretations of Bible
				Since everyone has a direct relation with God no interpretation is superior to another
				Hence endless interpretations came up
				And the Protestant church split further to 50000 sects
				Then some protestants said that there should be no interpretations of God and hence everything should be taken as it is.
			When a religion doesn’t accept an authority for gaining knowledge then the people either endlessly interpret or take up a route with no interpretations which is impractical and illogical.
			Jesuit schools for Christianity developed
				Oxford, Cambridge, Yale etc
				were originally started by Christians which later developed into secular schools
				These Jesuits study for 14 years out which 80% they study Hinduism remaining Christianity
				They study to refute Hinduism
				They know much more about Hinduism more than Hindus do.
			America is primarily a protestant country
				They strongly oppose celibacy
				When renounced order is not there in a tradition, then that religion has no living examples for scriptures.
			“Everyone thought that science is a gift by god to elevate people materially
				Just like Jesus came to us to elevate us spiritually, science came to elevate us materially.”
			The major argument the Christians use to defeat Hinduism is “If your religion is the true religion, then why are you poverty stricken? Why doesn’t your God help you?”
			Without Guru, Sadhu and Shasthra no one can reach Krsna
				Similar reason lead to the fall of Christianity
				People started telling there is no need for priest
				We can have direct relation with Jesus directly.
			When we reject the representatives of God then we ourselves become authority for studying the books
				This lead to the fall of Christianity
				People found out many discrepancies in Bible.
			There is not much description of Structure of Universe in the Bible
				The idea that earth is at the centre of universe was borrowed from Greek mathematician called Tollemy and Catholic Church adapted it
				So when Galleleo had told otherwise, it was seen as an attack on Christianity
				The church tried to persecute him and this lead to the fall of the Church.
			Slowly science further said that “We do believe in god, but we don’t believe in his word” and they rejected many statements saying “It is not scientific”
			Then Darwin’s theory developed and people rejected god also
				So in western history it moved

			“Reject priests –> Reject words of God –> Reject God”

			Many Christians are now on the defense
				So the faith in religion depends on the representative’s life.
			One of the major causes of Atheism is the irresponsible behavior of the Christian priests.
			ISCKON’S CASE:

			Our leaders generally face tremendous opposition in the areas where Church has high influence.
			John paul -II in the second Vatican council meeting declared “We accept good in all other religions also”
			So initially at the beginning stage of ISCKON most of the Christians wanted to inquire the intellectual aspects of other religions and appreciated them also.
			Christians have three approaches to Sanathan Dharma.
			Condemnation –> If you follow this religion, you go to hell (Attitude of early Christians who came to India)
			Irrelevance –> These books are so old and none of them are real or relevant
				It is also not practically
				Max muller was the pioneer of Vedic scriptures in English
				He respected scriptures but said that the Vedic scriptures start with flashes of brilliance, but end in total darkness.
			Fulfillment –> Hinduism is good
				Practice it so that you become good human being and you become qualified to receive the mercy of Jesus and then you will be saved.
			John Paul – II said that “If we offer more souls to Jesus the process of his coming back to earth will be accelerated! So maintain Christianity in essence, but externally follow rituals as the hindus”
			So, in many places Deity worship to Jesus started
				In fact Jesusashtakam, Jesus-sahasranam etc.!! They have adapted the method of Jesus – Diksha
				They slowly became successful
				They are converting in underground way.
			The devotees have some interesting quotes regarding the rapid growth of Christianity in India.
			SP disciples are not allowed to stay in India as they don’t have Visas
				So many times SP said that “If Christian missionaries are allowed to come and spread their religion, why aren’t the Hare Krishna devotees allowed?”
			SP met many Christians who had criticized Sanathan Dharma very badly
				But SP said that “These Christian followers are men of integrity and devotion.” He was overall positive toward them.
			SP said many times that we should know BG like the Christians know bible
				We should have such missionary spirit.
			None of these missionaries are bad intended
				We can learn the preaching vigor from these Christians.
			Islam

			In the world almost one out of every four men are Muslims
			It is the second largest religion in the country.
			It is the fastest growing religion in the world.
			It is not growing fast because of conversion but mainly because of reproduction
				Average birth rate of world is 2.5, the average birth rate of Muslims is 8
			Several places in Europe have already become Muslims.
			Two main divisions in Muslims

			Sunis –> majority of the Muslims
			Sheyas –> mostly in Iran.
			Spain was mostly under Muslim rule in its history.
			Prophet full name is Mohammed Ibna Abdah Allah
				He lived for around 62 years.
			At his birth his father died and at age of 6 mother died
				He was taken care of by his grandfather.
			He was poor stricken
				Khadijah was a very rich woman in her place
				He served her as an assistant
				She was 15 years older to him
				Later they got married which was a turning point for him materially.
			Until 40 years nothing great happened
				Most of the people around him were Jews
				All this happened in Mecca.
			The three most important places for Muslims are Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.

			Mecca –> Most of his life Mohammed lived here
				He had a habit of going to the caves for a retreat where he heard the voice of Gabriel who is an angel (In Abrahamic religions, the Angels are intermediates between People and God)
				He was revealed the message of God
				He told that God is one and he should be worshipped.
			Nearby Mecca was the holy place of Khabha
				Allah is the name of God and it wasn’t coined by Mohammed
				There were many idols there because of which it was a tourist spot
				When Mohammed propagated his teachings, people considered him as an economic threat
				He had to face many dangers.
			When he was in Mecca, some people who were in Medina, which is another important city got attracted to him.
			They were first followers and they started preaching in Medina
				In Mecca, people decided that Mohammed should be assassinated
				At that time his followers sent him an invitation to Medina.
			He fled from Mecca to Medina
				Abu was his follower who later became his successor
				People from Mecca were mainly traders and those from Medina are farmers
				So Mohammed didn’t have a physical body which was fit for farming
				So the only option left was raiding through the trade routes
				Mohammed’s followers would raid and plunder their wealth
				So they were seen as financial threat to the people of Mecca.
			So there were two battles one at Badraver (Won), the next was at Uhud (lost)
				At that time Mohammed got a revelation that this defeat is a test from Allah
				He conquered tribes nearby
				He slaughtered the men and made women and children slaves, thus gaining power
				Later he was attacked by Mecca and he lost
				But instead of advancing, they thought he was no threat and retreated back.
			When he came back, he killed everyone
				This is taken as an example that whoever opposed Muslims should be killed
				Later the king of Mecca realized he couldn’t fight with Muslims and he voluntarily came and surrendered
				This is taken as a great victory in Islam.
			He then destroyed all the idols personally
				He had become too powerful, though he lived for two years after that
				He sent his generals and they started conquering several regions.
			The major development of Christianity isn’t during the time of Jesus
				He was primarily a teacher
				Paul took the role of an administrator and spread the religion
				But Mohammed combined the roles of a Brahman and a Kshatriya to spread the religions.
			Their learned people are called Ullamah.
			To associate anything material to God is to violate the sanctity to God
				So they opposed idol worship.
			Law book is called shariyah
				Prayer is called Salath and the activity of praying is called Namaz.
			Quran has 114 chapters called Suras and verses are called Aiahs.
			Suras are of different lengths.
			When Mohammed led his life, then suddenly Gabriel would enter into his body and give revelations
				His followers wrote it down
				Once he had gone to a desert into a camel when Quran entered into him
				His weight became so heavy that the camel couldn’t bear him.
			The revelation was done in Arabic
				So they believed that only in Arabic language the teachings are most effective
				Therefore they felt that translations are not of much use
				All recitations are done only in Arabic.
			Revelations happened at different times and at that time his followers had written it down
				The compilation etc
				happened later
				“In religion there should be no force” was one of the revelation.
			“Kill the Khafirs (people who are not religious) wherever you see them” was a later revelation
				So they said that the later revelation cancels the first.
			They also believe that to the extent Jews and Christians believed in Quran, to that extent they will be delivered.
			They said that Jesus will come again, but this time they will be followers of Mohammed and he will chastise all the Christians.
			Apart from Quran the life of Mohammed is given in Hadis
				One of the incidences is that he said, this is a revelation
				But after some time he would say No it was devil, cancel what you have written.
			Third Khalif was Utman
				Most of the Khalifs died very violent deaths
				He was murdered when he was praying
				This had sent shock waves all over.
			Ali was one of the closest followers of Mohammed
				He was the husband of Fathima who was the daughter of Mohammed
				Later Mohammed married 9 wives
				Some of his followers felt that Mohammed wanted Ali to be his successor
				When the first three Khalifs had died then Ali came to power.
			Ummayiad dynasty was the first dynasty in Islam
				Mughal is also another dynasty which came to India
				The king of Ummayiad, was felt that he opposed Islam initially
				So war broke between Ali (Who was the ruler of Islam) and ruler of Ummayiad and Ali was killed
				The followers of Ali are called as Sheyas and others are Sunis
				Sheyas made Ali’s son Hussain as the king and they marched to Ummayiad
				Hussain was killed
				Sheyas felt that they couldn’t save grandson of Mohammed
				Even today Sheyas torture themselves for this reason.
			From 12th century onwards Muslims came to India tangibly
				They came from different directions
				Hence one Muslims fought with others.
			Every time Muslims were less in number
				But they felt that anything done for Allah is fair
				So they declared treaty and when treaty was declared they attacked and conquered.
			Most of the interpretation of Hindu literature was done by Marxists who interpreted them as struggle of lower class over the upper
				So they said that when Islam came to India, it freed India from the caste system.
			Muslims considered Mohammed as the perfect person
				So as he bashed the idols in a place, they also bashed the idols
				At the time the temples were very wealthy
				They looted them all
				They said that temples are the stepping stones for building Mosques.
			Our Acharyas comments on Islam:

			Not so many interactions in with Muslims with most of our Acharyas.
			SP:

			His statements regarding Islam are overwhelmingly positive.
			“Just like Muslim children learned Quran in their childhood, so should our Hindu children learn scriptures.” He said.
			“Muslims as soon as they get some money they build Mosques
				So we should also build temples.”
			SP listened to salat once and went into trans.
			We get a complete different story when we study Islam under historical record and when we study from Guru, Sadhu and Shasthra
				We give priority to the teachings of our own Acharyas.
			Mohammed played both Brahman role and Kshatriya role, but most of his successors focused on Kshatriya role.
			Khalifs were also not so philosophically advanced
				The Ullamahs who were scholars, didn’t have much power
				The main power was with the Kings.
			This religion was transformed from “Search for God” to “Search for Political power” and political achievements were felt as the proof for development of religion.
			Muslim understanding is that God is a person but he doesn’t have a form
				‘Sufis’ were those who glorified Allah in an intimate way
				This was considered as blasphemy and hence they were persecuted by both ‘Sheyas’ and ‘Sunis’.
			According to their belief there are 7 Jannaths and above it is the throne of Allah
				All the believers would stay in the jannath and will enjoy materialistic life
				In fact the Jihadis belief is that when they die for the cause they would get 73 Virgins to enjoy with them for eternity and the beauty of them is also given.
			Their conception of happiness itself is different and also dangerous.
			There is more talk about Allah’s love in their books, but they say that Allah’s love is only for Muslims.
			They have five pillars
			Their prayers
			Statement of Faith
			Ritual fast
			Giving Charity
			Going to the pilgrimage
			In CC, Chapter 16 and 17 of Adilila, we have the meeting with Quazi where Caitanya Maha Prabhu says “Since you can’t bring the cows back to life, you can’t kill them and as you are killing them, you are going to hell.”
			Another place Caitanya Mahaprabhu says “There are many mistakes and illusions in your scriptures
				Their compilers not knowing the essence of knowledge gave orders that are against reason and argument.” Even Quazi accepted that their scriptures are recent and sometimes they contradict each other
				Scriptures are eternal.
			Islam is a way to god
				Because of many interpolations their scriptures are not reliable
				We accept their religion until the point they match with our scriptures
				Also we do take all necessary measures to protect our temples from the Jihadis
				They presence is a threat to the temples.
			The death of Gandhi made Hinduism a violent religion in front of other countries, though if we go its history there are little evidences of its violence
				So SP clearly made sure that no devotee would get caught up in the Hindu Muslim conflict.
			Right now in ISKCON there is no Kshatriya wing
				So we don’t get into quarrels with anyone, but our preaching must be vigorous because other religions are converting people and once the people are converted they become hostile
				So we have to reach them before other religions do!!
			Buddhism

			Buddhism is one of the growing religions of the world.
			Most of the Hawaii islands are now inhabited by Buddhists.
			Buddhism was started with Buddha who was from 6th century BC
				(563 AD to 483 BC)
			His life was recorded much after he departed.
			He was in a princely family and it was predicted that he will either become a king or a renunciate.
			His father in order to protect him grew him up in luxury.
			At the age of 20 he married and at 21 he gave birth to a son named Rahula.
			Rahula means bond
			His charioteer Chenna once took him to a ride where he saw the three great scenes:

			Old person
			Diseased person
			Corpse
			He then contemplated on how illusory is the material happiness.
			His charioteer took him to another ride, where he met for the first time in his life a renunciate.
			He was shaven headed and holding the staff
				When inquired about the details, he told that he had renounced the world as he was scared of the cycle of Birth and Death.
			That night he renounced the world and performed great austerities
				Five people saw him and joined him.
			Later when he was at the verge of death, he understood that tormenting the body is of no use
				As he got the realization, a celestial maiden appeared before him and gave him a glass of milk
				When he took it, the other five thought that he had given up his renunciation and they left him and went away.
			He continued and later got realizations
				After he was enlightened he went around teaching
				At that time he met his five followers again, they saw that he was very transformed and effulgent.
			He taught 8 fold path which is near to Satva guna
				His main principle was that Desire is the cause of suffering
				Giving up desire is the source of happiness
				For the procedure to give up desire he gave the 8 principles.

			Right thoughts
			Right intentions
			Right speech
			Right conduct
			Right effort
			Right livelihood
			Right mindfulness
			Right concentration
			In order to cultivate these he said “Don’t take any life.”
			He then transformed Angulima who was a bandit and said that if we can’t create any life then we can’t take lives.
			He thought ‘Astheya’ saying

			one shouldn’t steal.
			One should avoid sex misconduct.
			one shouldn’t take intoxicants.
			One should avoid false speech.
			On positive side they have:

			Buddha –> Doctor
			Dharma –> Medicine
			Sangha –> Association (Foundation to any spiritual path)
			Every fortnight they come together and recite the ‘Vow of monkhood’
			If anyone had not followed the vow, he is told to publicly confess it at that time
				If he tells it, then Buddha says he will be forgiven
				Their association concept is similar to that of Vedic literature.
			The concept of Dharma is more of giving up the negative (ignorance and passion) and coming into goodness
				(Very little about transcendent)
			When Buddha was asked what are you then he gave the answer that “I am awake” nothing more
			When he was asked once whether the body and soul are one and the same, then Buddha didn’t reply anything.
			Buddha taught something called “Agnosticism”
			There is Theism, Atheism and Agnosticism (We can’t know about God)
			He rejected Vedic literature
				He said that whether god exists or not nobody can know
				By looking at the world the only thing we can know is that desires cause suffering.
			He spoke very little philosophy
				But he looked very charismatic
				That is how Buddhism spread very rapidly.
			There is a code of conduct (vinaya patra) in which many jarring things are present.

			It is better to enter your penis into poisonous snake’s mouth than a woman’s vagina.
			It is better to enter your penis into a charcoal pit blazing with fire than a woman’s vagina etc.
			Initially Buddha never accepted women as monks
				But his disciple ‘Ananda‘ who was one of his leading follower, told him that if he hadn’t accepted women, then half of the world would be his followers
				Buddha replied “If I accepted women, then half of my followers will go away”
			Buddha lived for a century almost and then departed
				Later his disciples took the preaching ahead
				The conversion of Ashoka is the most vital turning point for the preaching of Buddhism.
			Ashoka’s grandfather Chandhra Guptha Mourya had a prime minister Chanakya
				He had written that the one thing that a King shouldn’t do is associate with Buddhists or Jains, reason being that the philosophies are world denying that the king will lose the impetus to rule the world.
			Ashoka sent his son to Sri Lanka
				His followers travelled east and west spreading Buddhism rapidly.
			SP says that “Buddhism spread by top down approach (Brahman –> Kshatriya –> Vaishya –> Sudra)” (Bottom down is that a large group of people follow a religion and elect their leader)
			Buddhism had adapted mostly Hinduism.
			SP says that Buddha had taught people “Common sense religious principles”.
			List of incarnations of Krsna comes twice
				First is in third chapter of first canto and again in seventh chapter of the second canto
				In second canto Buddha is described that he comes and shoots weapons and kill people.
			Even in the Buddhist concept there are three Buddha.

			Adi Buddha (The original person)
			Bodi satva Buddha (One who has attained enlightenment and comes back to preach)
			Manava Buddha (One who does Sadhana and attains enlightenment)
			Buddha had a series of events called “The Jathaka Tales” where Buddha tells of his previous incarnations.
			From his own narration he told that he was Adi Satva Buddha.
			In the Bhagavatam verse first canto it is given that in Kaliyuga, Lord will come as Buddha the son of Anjana in the province of Gaya just for deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist
				Three significant points in this verse.
			Siddhartha was never born in Gaya
				His mother’s name was not Anjana, but Maya.
			SP talks about the quote of BSST that Buddha is another name for vaishnava.
			But in Bhakthi Rasamritha Sindhu, Srila Rupa Goswami says that Buddhists are not the followers of Vedas.
			They are talking in different perspectives
				BSST was speaking in the context of ultimate aim of Buddha
				Lord sometimes comes to give the ultimate revelation and sometimes transcendental elevation.
			The present day Buddhists consider themselves as Atheists
				But there is no explicit statement that Buddha didn’t believe in God
				He never spoke of god (Non Theistic, more precisely Pre Theistic, in the sense of foundation for spirituality).
			Anjana was the name of Buddha’s Grandmother
				After Buddha was born, within seven days his mother passed away and for all practical purposes she was his mother.
			As far as Gaya is concerned, Buddha took birth in Gaya, as he reached his enlightenment
				BGM here speaks about Buddha not Siddhartha
				Or perhaps it could refer to Adi Buddha.
			Buddhism has two divisions
				Later several divisions broke out
				It is a classic example of a religion that almost entirely goes away from its roots when it spreads widely.

			Mahayan –> The great path
			Heenayan –> The lower path
			According to Buddha one has to get enlightenment (Arhath hood) to escape from this world and later attain Nirvana.
			Buddhism tells us that this world is false and brings us to nothingness
				KC shows us the reality.
			Candle light exists –> it will consume the candle (existence –> suffering) and if the candle light ceases then there is no melting (no suffering)
				End your existence and end your suffering.
			It is quite popular as there is no need to surrender to God
				According to Buddha if one is serious, he can attain Nirvana in three lives.
			In their idea Bodi Satva could attain Nirvana but desires to come back again and again to deliver others.
			Mahayan said that they were more compassionate and Heenayan were selfish.
			But people started innovating newer things as the days passed by
				They said that Bodhi Satva are so enlighten that they can forget all the rules for the sake of compassion and they became relaxed.
			A new sect called Vajrayan emerged in 7th century
				They discovered new life of Buddha
				This Buddha consorts with Woman and enjoys all kinds of Luxuries
				According to them, by giving up sense gratification, one can slowly achieve Nirvana, but if one engages in it one can quickly attain Nirvana.
			Tantra has two parts (Vajrayan Buddhism teachings)

			Right hand Tantra –> Deity worship
			Left hand Tantra –> The sexual energy when released can lead to enlightenment.
			This came later in Hindus also
				The sahajiyas have mixed Vaishnav teachings with this Vajrayan
				‘Unrestricted Sexual indulgence leads to enlightenment’
			This concept in the modern world is called Zen Buddhism
				There is no need for philosophy, only need is experience
				“Listen to the sound of silence” (All kinds of unthinkable nonsense).
			It is very popular because it is “Live in the experience”
				Consistently popular spiritual leader in the world is Da Lei Lama
				He portrayed religion as religion as compassion and nonviolence.
			In South Indian tour Caitanya Maha Prabhu meets Mayavadi, Buddhists and Jains
				BSST gives critic of Buddhism in Gaudiya Bhasha
				He says that because the Buddhists don’t read scriptures, they stay in the zone of speculation.
			Buddha’s silence when asked about the next successor, tells us about the Emergency solution that Buddha wanted to offer.
			Shankarachaya later drove Buddhism from India
				All the Vaishnav acharyas like Ramanuja Acharya, Madhva Acharya and Shankhara Acharya took birth in South India
				When Islam attacked India, most of the North Indians were Buddhists
				Because of their advent and Shankar’s philosophy the Buddhists were practically driven out of India.
			Till 1950’s we had a few Buddhists in India until the time of Ambhedkhar.
			Buddhists resent the idea that, Buddha is a reincarnate of Vishnu
				They say that Hindus have appropriated Buddha into their teachings.
			During his death Ambhedkhar and Lakhs of his followers accepted Buddhism
				Ambhedkhar had written a book why he had accepted it
				But he had accepted what he thought as Buddhism
				In fact there is a famous saying that he had accepted Ambhedhkharism.
			Many of the Buddhists in India are now ‘Anti Hindus’
				In order to prove themselves separate from Hindus they say that “Reincarnation is correct but there is no soul!!” When asked what is it that reincarnates their reply is that “There is nothing that reincarnates
				But there is something which is an illusion
				We have to come out of the illusion by negating that something.”
			Our sense of I hood is an illusion
				It is created by our memories and imaginations
				It is the illusion that reincarnates.
			However some followers have accepted that Buddha never said soul doesn’t exist
				He never spoke about soul.
			Satva Guna culture, Reincarnation and Karma are the similarities between Buddhism and Vaishnavism.
			It is better not emphasize that Buddha is a reincarnate of Krsna to Buddhists.
			Buddhists feel that Hindus have appropriated their religion head into their own religion
				Jainism also rapidly spread throughout India
				But they did more than declaring their Autonomy
				They appropriated Hindus into their religion
				There is whole Jain Ramayan and Jain Mahabharat
				There is a series of Puranas
				They believe in following God to become greater than him
				They think God is a guide for us to attain enlightenment.
			Sikhism

			Three levels of telling about all religions:

			All religions are telling the same thing, everything is the same
				(Simply Harmonious)
			Everybody has their own rituals and believes and they are all different and the reasons for conflict.
			See what are the essential similarities and differences.
			About the first level SP says that if we are in darkness, we see that everything is the same, that is dark
				(Ignorance, sentimental level) –> We see what provides us sense gratification.
			When we say that all are different then it is in passion
				–> We only see the external things.
			In goodness, we can see in an enlightened perspective that goes beyond externals
				–>We can see the externals but also beyond it, the internals.
			In transcendence we can see the underlying spirit.
			We are primarily trying to see in mode of Goodness.
			SP says that “Buddha is the emblem of theism for the Atheists.” for those who don’t accept God they accept Buddhism and they are later elevated
				Acharyas have the transcendental perspectives as they are transcendental.

			Sikhism:

			It came up when India was torn apart in between Islam and Hinduism.
			Sikhism is a blend of Islam and Hinduism.
			1486 CM appeared
				In those centuries there was a devotional revival in Hinduism.
			CM never told any of his disciples to build deities
				Also there is no record of any temple Sankirtans
				Most of the Sankirtans happened in Srivas Thakhur’s house and they used Shaligrams which never were considered as a threat by the Muslim rulers.
			There two representations of god.
			Iconic –> You have a particular shape, and you assume that shape represents the shape of God.
			Non Iconic –> Shaligram is a stone and there is no form of Krishna with Shaligram in the spiritual world
				Shiva Linga is another iconic representation
				Not the targets of Muslim rulers.
			Sikhism rejects deity worship
				Focus was on religion being easily practiced.
			CM also gave priority to chanting in this age of kali
				He was the most prominent propagator and said how the holy names of Krishna is actually Krsna himself.
			In this period, Hinduism was defensive and Islam was offensive.
			Guru Nanak took birth in 1469, born in a Kshatriya family and was married by the age of 20 and had two children.
			One day he went to bathe in the river and disappeared for three days
				It is said that actually through the river he had been taken to God.
			Sikhism also has the idea that God is a person but has no form.
			He went somewhere where he had the experience of God
				He was given a pot which he drank (Amrith) and he was told “Let the holy name be your refuge and share the glories of the holy name with everyone”
			From the Amrith he had got, the place became Amrithsar.
			He said that Sikhism is a way of life devoted to God
				No focus on philosophy.
			When Guru Nanak was in his last days he called one of his followers and gave him the name Angadha, which meant I give myself to you
				So they considered that power of Guru Nanak was transferred to him.
			Guru Arjun was the first one who started systematizing the teachings of Sikh.
			During the time of Guru Tej Bahadhur (GTB), Aurangzeb was the ruler
				Kashmir Pandits were being persecuted by Muslims forcing them to convert into Islam
				At that time GTB was the leader and a Kshatriya
				The Kashmir Pandits took shelter of GTB
				He fought with Aurangzeb, but he was defeated, tortured and killed.
			The word Sikh literally meant disciple.
			Guru Arjun was also killed and thus many of the Sikhs were persecuted.
			When GTB was killed, his son Guru Gobind Singh was his son and was 11 years old
				He became the inheritor and later formed something called Kalsa (Sikh army).
			He came with two swords.
			Spiritual sword (Piri) –> Spiritually powerful
			Material sword (Miri) –> Materially powerful.
			He then took out his sword saying that his sword wants a head and asked who would offer him the head.
			One disciple came to him
				He took him to his tent and after he came out the sword was red
				Then he said he wanted one more head and took him inside and came out after some time
				Then he kept on doing it for five times
				The fifth time he said he wanted more heads
				People were horrified and some started walking away.
			He smiled and went in and brought the five disciples out and said that all those five were ready to lay their lives for Sikhism.
			Sikhs have distinctive identity wearing shorts, having long hair and a dagger etc.
			He militarized the entire Sikh
				Later Guru Gobindh Singh was killed
				But before his death, he said that further there won’t be any Guru and Granth Sahib would be their Guru.
			Guru Granth Sahib:

			Therefore Guru Grant Sahib was the Guru for everyone
				It is a huge book full of rhymes.
			It is a longest book of Rhyme poetry.
			Specific script called Guru Mukhi was devised.
			These thousand verses come from various sources.
			974 verses from Guru Nanak
			62 couplets from Guru Angadh.
			Some verses from Hindus like Ramdev, Kabir etc.
			Some from Islamic sufis
			There is one God and ultimately God is Truth.
			There are three principles:

			Langar –> Sikh version of Food For Life (SP appreciated how efficiently people cooked and served)
				Free food to anyone who comes to Gurudwara.

			Seva–> They take shoes of people who visit Gurudwara and polish them
				The people who are polishing could be big businessmen
				(But inside the Gurudwara there is no deity, but only the book
				But the tendency to worship, decorate is there and hence they decorate the book as we decorate Deity.)

			Sangadh –> Association (Which is principle to all religions)
			Guru Nanak had written this book to include both Hindus and Muslims, which is good for that particular time, but needn’t necessarily mean that it is true religion
				No critical statements by SP anywhere.
			They accept Karma, Reincarnation, Chanting, the goal of liberation.
			They reject caste system, idol worship, authority of Vedas and the idea of renunciation.
			The relaxation on renunciation is a concession for the people of Islam.
			Regarding, the rejection of the authority of Vedas, they don’t exactly reject it, but they transcend it
				They say that just study of Vedas won’t reveal God to us
				Guru Granth Sahib is the revealed word of God.
			Their idea is that all the saints who gave verses were inspired by god
				Also they select which statements by the saints are revealed and which are not
				They integrate what they thought as revealed statements.
			It had much more similarity with Hinduism than Islam.
			Punjab is the area with maximum Sikhs and at the time of partition, it got divided
				So the Sikhs had to flee from Pakistan, as they had more similarities with Hindus
				Though they didn’t worship the deities they had the concept of chanting names of Ram and in fact, they accepted Krishna as the supreme God.
			During the partition many of the Sikhs who resided in the temple of Amritsar, battled against external forces
				At that time Indira Gandhi with her military forces did the operation blue star and killed the forces within, enraging the Sikhs
				This lead to the assassination of Indira Gandhi which further lead to more violence
				These scars are still there in them
				But they are the closest to the Hindus, both culturally and devotionally.
			We look at the similarities and encourage the people to practice God consciousness.
			Not many Acharyas interacted with Sikhs.
			There are three kinds of Preaching:
			Polemic –> You are wrong
				Criticize and find faults
			Ironic –> Both of us have so many similarities.
			Apologetic –> To explain how I am right.
			We use different strategies according to TPC.
			SP preaching with other religions was generally ironic.
			SP was rarely Apologetic
				He said Varnashram is not caste system, it is not with birth to decide caste
				(Proving ours correct –> Apologetic)
			Whenever we interact with people of other religions, then we mostly be ironic
				At least we start with similarities.
			It is possible that Sikhs convert into Vaishnavas
				Don’t agitate anyone
				Generally most of the people don’t know completely about their religion.
			We can encourage them to chant.
			QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

			When we focus on the similarities between KC and other religion when preaching, what if the person becomes more interested in his religion than ours?

			KC is not the only way to approach God
				Different religions are like the pathways to go up to the top of the same mountain
				But some pathways might start well, but they might turn out to be dead ends after some distance.(Like Buddhism)
				But still they are climbing up the mountain
				There are two kinds of conversions.

			Horizontal conversion –> A person converts from a Hindu materialist to Christian materialist
				(not really conversion)
			Vertical conversion –> becoming from materialist to spiritualist
				(From lovers of mater to lovers of god).

			We want to vertical conversion
				We have to make people aware of the path to go back home
				We don’t say that our path is the only path, but our path is the easiest path
				We can see that also
				Our KC devotees potency can be tested by seeing the regulative principles we follow
				Our path is ‘Smooth’ and ‘Swift’
				We let the people make their own choices after informing about the choices.

			It is very much necessary to tell about the differences also
				How long can we hold the similarity?

			Everybody will have to make a choice at some time or the other
				Our preaching to people of other religion is like building a bridge
				So when they start appreciating what we do and start adapting, it is like they crossing over the bridge
				By Krsna’s arrangement some day when they have crossed Krsna will break the bridge
				Our responsibility is we don’t break the bridge before they cross over
				So the critical choice that they have to make shouldn’t come prematurely by circumstances created by us
				The differences have to be told when a person is matured spiritually.

			HINDUISM – I

			26 December 2014

			17:55

			Kharma khanda, Jnana Khanda and Bhakthi not only help person to elevate from one level to other, but they also manifested historically progressively.
			At the start of Kali Yuga first 2000 years Kharma Khanda became prominent
				As reaction to that Buddhism, Jainism came.
			On response to this Shankhar acharya brought Jnana Khanda
				It brought back people to Vedic fold from Buddhism and Jainism
				But it made spiritual matter intellectualized.
			From 14th century onwards, Bhakthi started taking its roots and spread all over the country
				The Sri Sampradaya and Madhva Sampradhaya didn’t talk about Bhakthi at their time as the time wasn’t appropriate.
			As the people were fully on the impersonalist Brahman, Madhva and Ramanuja acharyas spoke only of Vishnu.
			Later CM revealed the highest truth.
			According to the western terminology there are two things in a religion:
			Belief
			Behavior
			All our beliefs and behavior are permeated with spiritual understanding.
			So the very idea that religion and rest of life are separated is a western concept.
			Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life.
			Modern day Hinduism forms from the Bengali renaissance
				(1750’s to 1890)
			Historically Bhakthi spread all throughout the country mainly because of Charismatic saints.
			CM revived it in the east
				In the western side we have Tukharam maharaj and western saints.
			We have Narsimha Mehta, and Mira Bhai in Gujarat and Rajasthan
				Similarly Tulsi Das in north India.
			Devotional and spiritual emotions can be mistaken for each other if there is no proper philosophical understanding.
			By the time British had come to India most of the Brahmanas focused more on protecting their Karma Khanda philosophies than educating people about Bhakthi.
			Thus Bhakthi lost its intellect and was misunderstood.
			The Brahmanas spoke only Sanskrit
				When the British started their educational system, they primarily taught their versions of translated Hindu scriptures
				The translators were motivated and biased.
			Thus a void was created
				To protect India, Mayavad was thought of us the best school of thought
				The thought of impersonal Brahman unified India
				Thus it was propagated by many Indian scholars.
			This was new kind of Mayavad and was mostly nationalist type.
			Our KC unifies the Abrahamic religions and the Mayavads with a universal underlying principle.
			The Abrahamic Religions:

			They believe that there is one God.
			By loving that God we can become supremely happy.
			But they are highly exclusivists.
			The Mayavad:

			It is Universal
				(They are nonspecific).
			Sometimes they are pluralists also
				(One mayavad teacher told that there are as many religions as there are people in the world
				Don’t accept religion from anyone and you find your perception of God for yourself)
			But this reduces God to a mere conception
				It sounds open minded
				Yes we should be open minded, but not so much that our brains fall out.
			Krishna says that we have to submit both our rational and emotional faculty to him.
			Abrahamic religions are highly emotional but intellectually alienated
				(How if God is unlimited, there can be only one way to God? And that too your way only)
			In other way round, Mayavad is intellectually appealing, but emotionally alienating
				(Nothing for the heart there).
			There are three parts to a normal western debate:
			Thesis –> Someone proses an argument.
			Anti-Thesis –> Other person proposes opposite argument.
			Synthesis –> Find good from both sides add them and remove the bad.
			KC is the synthesis as it is appealing both intellectually and emotionally.
			One main obstacle to KC is that people often see it as a sectarian religion.
			SP in principle pointed out the Universal aspects of the religion, but in practice he followed the Sectarian aspects quite strongly.
			SP taught his devotees to cook Indian Cuisine, chant Hare Krishna Maha mantra only, because these are the most conducive to practice KC.
			Some people tell that Krishna is one of the Hindu gods, making KC look like sub-sectarian conception
				(We are subset of Hinduism).
			We can look Krishna in two ways:
			Historical or Mythological figure.
			Understanding Krishna after understanding the philosophy
				(Correct understanding
				Supreme person who manifested through History to save us)
			There is no other religion which systematically and scientifically explains how the relationship between God and Soul develops.
			KC has to be presented in this way
				We can then combine the two schools of thought into one shelter of Krishna.
			SP told the basic philosophy and gave his disciples higher taste through chanting.
			SP told that we could spread KC in two ways:
			Make an influential person devotee and he brings KC to the world
				(He didn’t spend much time on it)
			Make large number of people devotees and they elect a proper head of state.
			Person, a book and an event remark beginning of a religion
				But nothing of this works for Hinduism.
			Our BG got a lot of popularity, because all the political people at the time of freedom used it as a handbook to interpret nationality.
			But it isn’t The book because before it also Hinduism existed
				So people may accept it as one of the authority but they don’t accept it as the highest.
			There is no organizational structure for Hinduism
				There is no one voice which can represent Hinduism.
			So the only way that we can say about Hindus is by saying about Vedas.
			The English mixed up Hindus in a very politicalized geographical way
				(Durga devi holding an Indian flag is depicted as Barath Mata
				But the Indian flag was designed by Bhankhim Chatarjee in 1905
				How is Durga devi holding it?).
			The authority of Vedic literatures got substantially reduced and Hinduism was equated with nationalism.
			Hinduism got divided into two broad authorities:
			Traditional centers of authority –> Date back to hundreds and thousands of years
				(Well connected to tradition, but less connected to modern people)
			Charismatic Hindu leaders –> Well connected with people but less connected to tradition (Satya sai baba etc.)
			Responsible preaching would include Faith and Sensitivity
				A preacher is a junction between tradition and audience
				What connects him to the tradition is his faith and what connects him to the audience is sensitivity.
			ISKCON is the only or one of the very few of this type
				This gets ISKCON get a wide range of Preaching scope.
			Questions and Answers:

			Is it necessary to unite the two schools of thought?

			SP didn’t try much for inter faith sort of preaching, nor did he encourage
				But there might be some situations where it might be necessary
				But in west, sometimes in danger we say we are Hindus
				We can say that Vrindavan is not in material world, but if we have to place it somewhere, then we place it in India
				Similarly KC isn’t subset to any religion
				But if we have to place it in the religious categorization of the world, then we say we are Hindu.

			Just like using material constructs like computers etc
				for the purpose of KC, Hinduism is a subtle construct
				Ours is Yuktha Vairagya
				So some of our leaders have good bonds with other organization.

			BG comes under smriti, and is not a Hindu book then how can we present the person conception of God (in a debate)?

			This is a categorization that we have to be aware of
				A tradition is not a fossil that is preserved in a museum
				A tradition is a living experience practiced in reality
				Shankara Acharya is considered as one of the most prominent Hindu teachers
				Upanishads are Shruthi
				But Shankara Acharya says that among all the Upanishads, BG is the essence.

			BG is to be understood from the teachers of the tradition
				Primary teachings of a tradition are to be understood from the authorities of tradition, not that we artificially look at it from outside and judge its teachings.

			Refuting Western Science & Religion

			Two misconceptions:
			Only material exists
				No spirit.
			Mater has nothing to with spirit.
			MATTER exists and SPIRIT does not:
			Matter in itself doesn’t grow, but it grows in the presence of spirit.
			Physics is the study of structures of matter.
			Scientists have achieved full success in study of matter (Physics) and interactions of matter (Chemistry).
			The study of matter by the man will help the man to apparently control and transform the matter for the better.
			So the scientists used the approach of physics and chemistry to study even biology.
			Biology = Study of life.
			So even the doctor of allopathic type thinks if there is any problem with the body then the default is either the structure of the body or its chemical composition, which is only partially correct
				Because we may have a erfect body but it may be dead.
			Matter undergoes only three transformations
			Creation
			Deterioration
			Destruction.
			Living matter (matter through which life is manifesting) undergoes 6 changes.
			Creation
			Growth
			Maintains itself
			Reproduces–> Sex is a very dangerous activity
				Because when a living entity is participating in it, it is totally blinded and in that time a predator can come and eat it
				So why did the species keep sex life at all? (A big challenge to the theory of evolution)
				But scriptures give a clear explanation
				The soul as it is envious of Krsna wants to control another soul and to satisfy his desire, the sex is created.
			Deterioration
			Destruction
			These three can’t be explained by physics and chemistry only
				They can be explained but only to certain extent.
			Hitler thought that all the physically handicapped and deficient people are weak and nature will eliminate them in their struggle for existence and he shall help the nature.
			The value of Human life is lost when we think we can apply the laws of physics and chemistry to explain biology.
			Soul and Consciousness have an ‘Achintya – Beda abeda’ relation with each other.
			Certain matter behaves differently than other matter which can’t be explained on a material basis.
			SPIRIT exists but has no connection with MATTER:
			This is the Idea of western religions.
			The western religions use the things like Vishwaroop etc
				to say that the Hindu followers are Pantheists (Everything is God, like stone, rock car etc.).
			Western religions say that there are only two things:
			There is one God (Monotheist)
			There are many Gods (Polytheists)
			We Muslims, Christians are monotheists and Greeks, Hindus etc
				are polytheists.
			Vedic explanation is much more higher
				There is one God but he comes in many forms
				Ours is ‘Polymorphic Monotheism’
				Still there is further understanding in Bhakthi
				We don’t worship one God, but worship couple
				So Bhakthi is ‘Polymorphic bi monotheism’
			People with preliminary understanding of God come and deride more sophisticated religions.
			We don’t worship everything as God
				But we understand everything as sacred
				Everything is the Abode of God.
			In the Vedic philosophy, God’s mercy is manifested as the fullest in two ways:
			The spiritual world is described to the fullest in our tradition.
			How God manifests himself through matter in various ways by which we can connect with him is also explained.
			If God is completely spiritual and we can think only of matter, then how can we possibly connect to God at all?
			God remains only an intellectual concept
				We can’t think of him spiritually
				Krishna out of his mercy manifests himself through matter.
			Supreme lord has five manifestations:
			Para –> form of Narayana in spiritual world.
			Vyuha –> Aniruddha, Sankharshan etc
				(Who are in connection with material world)
			Antaryami –> Super soul present in the heart of all living entities.
			Avatar –> To come in the world to exhibit his past times.
			Archa avatar –> The deity
			So for us matter is sacred, because Krishna manifests through it
				But that doesn’t imply we have to worship matter.
			Generally Vedas say that, whatever we can see as God’s grace we can worship God through that
				Cows and the bulls are the source of prosperity to all the villagers
				So they worship God through that
				It doesn’t mean that they are worshipping the cow!!
			Pandavas used to respect their weapons
				So that which is the most important to us, we see God’s grace through that.
			Universal form is an important understanding but not the highest
				But for those who can’t understand anything beyond matter, they can pray Krishna through it.
			SP says that God can’t have a material form
				But the principle is, whatever way we can think of God, we think of God
				So for a person if physical form is important then he can think of Virat form
				(Sun and moon are the eyes, mountains are the bones, heavenly planets are his forehead etc.)
			The important point is we think of God
				Krishna manifests in so many ways to reach the people.
			Krishna’s great mercy is that he manifests in the form of a deity
				How can we make relation with God, if he isn’t a person? In Rig Veda, Sam Veda etc
				the deity worship is not mentioned, because there the purpose is not to make a relation with God but to use higher power to satisfy our own material desires.
			For karma Kanda worship, the deity isn’t necessary because the people don’t bother whom they are praying to as long as their desires are fulfilled.
			But in the Puranas there is extensive mention of the Deity worship
				But unfortunately Mayavadis say that God can’t be conceived so we create a symbol to show God in whatever form we like.
			BSST quotes from Phushkhar Samhitha that the five Gods Shiva, Shakthi, Vishnu, Surya and Ganesh are not equal but are progressive.
			Surya –> If somebody wants Dharma
			Ganesh –> for Artha
			Shakthi –> for Kama
			Shiva –> for Moksha
			Vishnu –> To go further beyond.
			It’s a progression.
			In modern times Surya lost his popularity and Shiva, Ganesh and Durga are worshipped extensively.
			The impersonalists say that symbol is for the less intelligent person to help him go beyond the person
				Muslim preachers taking advantage of this statement say that we don’t have a symbol and hence we are more intelligent.
			It’s a cheap argumentation
				Sometimes people are so ignorant that they don’t understand they are in ignorance.
			SP says “KC has enough ammunition that it can blow away all the illusion of the world
				But unfortunately the Ammunition is in the Go down.”
			Hate the Adharma, but we don’t hate it’s preachers
				We should feel how the Atheism and other illusory energies are spreading and develop the preaching spirit within ourselves.
			Questions And Answers:

			Is Vishwaroop a conception or is it really existing or is it a conception?

			There are many meanings for Vishwaroop
				The understanding of Vishwaroop as Virat form is not exactly factual
				Vishwa is a roop of the God because God manifests through it
				The form of Maha Vishnu or Garbodhakshay Vishnu etc
				then we can see that matter and spirit are the body of God
				Just like the body doesn’t grow if the soul is not there, similarly the universe doesn’t grow if the super soul is not there
				God is a soul and Vishwa is his body, if we see it like that then it is correct
				Material reality is a reality which creates illusion
				The idea that things are disconnected from Krishna is the illusion
				The things are real
				If for a long time people worship a particular form of the lord, then even if the prana prathishta isn’t done, then the lord in reciprocation to the sincerity manifests through it also.

			Vishwaroop isn’t God –> no
			Vishwaroop is God –> no !!

			It isn’t that there is a 1 or 0 answer
				It is in between
				God’s eternal form isn’t Vishwaroop
				So Vishwaroop isn’t God
				God out of his mercy manifests himself as Vishwaroop
				It depends on one’s Bhakthi
				Also we say that, It is God but it is a lower level manifestation of God.

			How can we understand the creation of the universal form?
			Vishwaroop isn’t manifested always
				When a body dies, the soul leaves it
				But when the soul re-enters the body is alive again
				Similarly when the super soul enters the universe, then the Universe is alive
				But when it leaves the universe dies.

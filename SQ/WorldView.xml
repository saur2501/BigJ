    <Atheism>
        <Flavors> Rejection of Scriptures vs Rejection of Deity
            Buddhism
            Jainism
            Charvakism
        </Flavors>
        Atheistic arg
            Nutrition- all the elements- figure out- else limiting factor causes suck. why?
            Season extremes- God's design to cause people death from sunburn?
                Ppl die by stroke. Proteins break after 45 Celsius. Carcinogenic.
            Animal attacks in villages,water- natural! Bot fly, deadly-diseases by God?
                    mosquitoes kill them then hell, don't kill them then hell now!
            Without medical science, people were dying early cuz microbes, no operation facilities.
            Live life of complexity without guidance (what should my stand be- for peaceful,happy or BTG stay)
                    But you are not approaching God for guidance or scriptures.
                            bring it forth- if you claim to have answers to questions, make blogs, make websites.
                    you don't approach guru of all disciplines- people figure out, standardize it and pass it down.
                            we have figured it out. No revelation in that context.
            Claim- Everything happen for good!
                    You make most out of everything. Situ was a facility but sth else- would have done some other favor.
            Misguidance scriptures have caused in past.
                    fights over stands.
                    followers focus on few short passages and not the whole theme.
            Atheism-
                it's animal nature that governs the world- imagine why someone would be accepted by everyone as king!?
                    the weak player is sidelined- yes, we can say God arranged it for him (this would be best)- but as he changed his nature- his world changed.
                Compile Time Controller- Every law (or its appearance) is essentially arranged for the best for the jiva (assuming he is all  merciful- he may not be)- purpose he intended (fulfill desires and give purification) vs give us enjoy.
                Compile Time Obligate Controller- Laws didn't automate the life creation- he "chiselled" it out!
                Run Time Facultative controller-
                Run Time obligate controller- All incidents are ultimately best for you. For every human and animal- case studies!!
                I should not start atheist research myself- I have to commit to study from giants and sincerely check for completeness or differences (communication gaps,leaps)
                    when encountering a negative/counter eg in theory while practicing- 1. ask superior (they have dedicated their lives. 2. Refer to width of explnations across other ideologies also.)
                        of course, complete the loop.
                        if studying or practicing, give your heart to it, or don't do it!!
                        accept people for what they are- they have their ideology and thus, bias- and will manipulation emotions accordingly- it's but human nature- doing things on dharma!
                        I can't prove sth wrong doesn't make it right- but a healthy perspective
                You don't have to have colossal agreement or disagreement with any expert of ideology.
                If you get frustrated over questions that seemingly disapprove God. You want to negate incidents which all speak nothing but truth, you are dream lover and not truth lover.
                    get to see the truth the way it is. Not the way I want it.
                    Should I not be open to ideas, at least.
                    I do yoga because that's me. Not because it will take me somewhere- yoga and I are one.
                    What is tough situation, it is just exposure of existing gap between your current state and your ideology.
        Misc - Atheism - take things in package - make person feel indebted and then abduct his soul.
            No1 knows - agnostic to confidence. Lust remains - high of excitement temporary cuz no channel for higher layers.
            it's a well thought framework where everything has an answer - so it qualifies as a great philosophy
                but nevertheless being adding a dimension - there are multiple candidates of what could actually be true.
            solace yourself with false assurance instead of taking a practical and pragmatic stand in the world and accepting world for what it is.
            Health improved after I gave it up completely and accepting "normal" lifestyle - my KC lifestyle was causing all the problems.
            Diwali fire in magazine story - mistake is mistake. Laws don't forgive and go agnostic to your beliefs - gotta fall if imbalance.
                no transcendental narrative going on. Answer is 3 does are there - Jiva, prakriti ishwar and worldly outcome is controlled by them.
                    Jiva wants to push - he gets to do it. Gravity acts anyway. Magnetism and human psychology acts anyways - sanskars and vrittis happen anyway.

				vs Relative Problems
					Concerns 1 but not the other
					@Patients pain is dentist's joy.
					1 man's food is another's poison.
				Criteria
					Common to all
					Nobody wants it
					Nobody can avoid it
				viz - wrt to root cause of origin (adhi means- over, upon, in the presence of, etc)
					Adhyatmika - caused by mind and body
						US psychiatrist - 1 of 3 forced to consult
					Adhibhautika - arising due to other living entities

						enemies, 7 in work life, friend (not reciprocating), family over property.
						Other species - mosquito, rats, cats, dogs, etc.

                                                        makes e1 reflect- life is preparation and death is exam- Ram naam satya hai (should have chanted alive)

                                4 problems
                                    Birth- Easy delivery. Is it good for child. Not removed.
                                    Death- curing maladies. awareness of factors and guidance for prevention. Some machines (dialysis)

                                        per haven't removed diseases per se. Some diseases reappear with greater force or new ones.
                                        All of the above nevertheless are bound to be there.

                            <ThruNaturalLaws>
                            came thru metalaws (or same physical, chemical laws that govern)
                                    those laws ever existed- no explanation where they came from.
                                        Even Assembly plant that ends up constructing cars is not a chance but programmed/designed.
                                    natural laws don't even make a small machine (like watch on its own) in universe- how come such big machine?!
                                    Eg- big bang- improbable assumption, no theory has gained general acceptance.
                                        @Do bangs ever produce designs- Mumbai blasts. Hiroshima.
                                        Faith in conscious God or a point- gets a new garb. Start bang construction company!
                                    Not science vs religion
                                        Einstein- I believe harmony of world, not world of chance but appreciate wonders of God.
                                        Kelvin- Think strongly enough, science will force you to believe in God.
                                        Recent past trying to root God out.
                                    Darwin theory for pinnacle of God.

                                    scientific investgations- scientists have found out (lifespan of universe)
                                    then what's making this machine work so systematically (controlling machine)					
                                            why tree growing? cuz nucleus divides. why she divides? diffusion, blah blah. why so? natural laws make it happen.
                                            ultimately we know it is so thru observation- it happens for whatever reason.
                                    what's life- what's your expanation for it. 
                                    Acc to this, material elements ever live but not us: where we go (cease to exist?)
                                    Explain the universal machine (why it so exists)- it just does.

                                                    beauty is not in body but in soul- part and parcel of shri Krishna.

                                                is to reform us and purify us into pure souls.

                                                    why beating?
                                                        to get better version outta him,

                                                        disapproving wrong doings.
                                                If thief gets reformed, will police hit him anymore.
                                                    only adamant thieves get repeatedly punished.

                                                and old age in curing diseases.

                                            So scriptures say learn knowledge from early age so as to not succumb to moha/ mayajal.

                                    COA is still Lust
                                        Eg- Balaji- I will give him half of what I earn
                                            income tax got 50%- said Balaji already took his 50%.
                                            Later found his golden ring missing- balaji got his quota.
                                Why not
                                    ?center of attraction of God?!- but facility for us to approach him.
                                    material acquisitions we achieve and then lose- but sp is never lost.
                                    What's the best reward Hanuman can give- don't be miser- ask hanuman for love of Ram

                                        ?Why? It's a debt of favor/ love- spontaneous attraction/willingness to serve is not there.
                                CS understanding is God as impersonal or 1 of service- I am servant of Lord Rama.
                                    What's motivation of Hanuman simply out of love- this is bhakti- unmotivated, uninterrupted love.
                                        Hanuman said- found Sita in Lanka. So conscious of Lord's desperation. In Lanka, Sita I found- desperation would have increased.
                                        Low class servant- bahubal but less service. Middle class- does what's asked. First class- does more than asked (understanding mind of master)
                                            Found Sita, threat to Rakshasas. Terror in heart of Lankans. Hanuman- you are falling at my feet- I am smallest monkey in Lankan army.
                                            Put fire in Lanka. All I can give is an embrace.
                                Why
                                    Krishna has given rain, light, food, clothing, shelter, parents, etc            
                            Love
                                Salary for service is more service- love is not to demand anything in return of service.
                                service is not because of a favor but spontaneous expression of love.
                                Encompasses favor of duty

                                                    Conceive (with hypothetical super-eyes- absolute truth- being of it) of an entity that doesn't exist, can we imagine it
                                                        yes, if it is some combination of attribute values of the world.
                                                        no, if it has attributes which are unprecedented.
                                                Eg- Existence of Spiritual World- Everything we feel need for, exists in world, cosmic manifestation.
                                                    REL In mirage people crave for water cuz feel a need for it
                                                        it exists, we know from experienced in past
                                                        need is constitutional to our being (verifiable by past experience)
                                                    We feel need for unending love, peace, joy (mirage of world), there must be spiritual world.
                                                Why- ForAll x (BReal(x) OR BImagined(x)) and ForAll x (BReal(x) And BImagined(x) => Real(x) > Imagined(x)) where BReal are predicates.
                                                    If sum of total of everything is greater than imagined God, then that sigma is what we call as God.
                                                    I imagine an entity with all humanly attributes at their best. Maybe, there exists no real entity that's greater than imagination.

                        Science is based on observation and logic to establish truth values.
                        Spirituality is based on accepting revelation. Logics can be employed to establish the truth value.

                                Vedic time fights- battles not in middle but outskirts
                                weaklings of society protected- women, olds, cows, brahmanas, children.
                                Now, angry with country, blasts in trains, railway stations, crowded places, temples.
                                    Eg- Sankat Mochan mandir in varanasi
                            Theories are modified and updated, like napkins but misguide people while they are believed into dangerous actions.
                                "What is goal of life" is not accomodated in scientific jurisdiction.
                                Extensions of defense mentality- manifests as advanced claws and teeth- bombs, etc
                                    we fly like butterfly, swim like fish. Problem is can't walk like humnas- pollution, fears, etc

                        @Lame and Blind together- Einstein- Spirituality is lame without science and science is blind without spirituality (no vision)
                            no purpose, values
                            like we study NDE, OBE, etc- using science for spiritual concepts
                                we present spirituality very systematically.
                            SP- Indians are ppl sitting on diamond throne- begging for broken glasses.

                        vs Once no rains in Pune- we will bring artificial rains. It means blow clouds and bring above city of Chennai- silverlined it
                            few droplets fell.
                            Artificial rains, no grains, real pains
                        ID- wind, water, sun all dead- how dead things combine to produce effect of rain- on which living entities are so dependent?
                            10 miles radius close- but no rain even if airplanes pass thru them.
                            Jivas also can't create rain, grain, etc but God has given eth.

                            @If material things cud act on their own- why my kurta doesn't get washed and dried and sit in my cupboard.
                            @Iron filings moving- cuz magnet behind scene moving them- automatic but orchestrators don't know

                                        Liberate and BTG- population will reduce- some from hellish, some from heaven, some evolution so increasing.
                                        @10th class ppl fail but 9th class ppl also join- popu rises.
                                    TEACHING Avoid redundancy in Camp Lectures- if basics are not clear- arrange them rather than changing the platform.
                                        You didn't attend DYS5- who is your facilitator? Vivek Pr, plz explain to him- if don't follow I will explain.

                                    Who's the doer
                                    We desire, God permits, Material nature make things move on
                                        Eg- smoke cigar, material nature arranges.
                                        Eg- go to temple- God arranges thru material nature.
                                        Destiny- 
                                            from past life- good parents, good profession, enough to eat, healthy body
                                                but result of our choices only.
                                                paap- ugly, legal implications, illiterate, etc.
                                            But how you will use the money is not destined- that's free will.
                                            TEACHING Metadata- See, I will explain you. Make it relatable- you have a bank account?

                                                If you have human body, then must enquire AT- refer scriptures- Vedanta starts "Therefore..."- cuz humans will open book not cats.
                                                    Many ways to learn what is good/ bad- hearing or experiencing, etc
                                                        eg- Cigar is injurious to health- some turn the wrapper, some died with cigar in mouth.
                                                    God in your heart- then he will guide you to somewhere- where your questions will get answered.

                                                Let thy will be done not mine (Surrender)
                                                    @do anything with money- but son says- what do you want me to do?
                                                        vs Father sends money to college stud but smoke cigar- better focus on studies.
                                                    Obey God and get more freedom.
                                                    Giving Suffering in Love- pinch or slap is also a form of love.
                                                Why confusion in the world?
                                                    don't see the truth- someone can show you.
                                                    So attend such camps- Thank you! brilliant!

                                                If someone is blind, what fault? If murdered in last life, what is fair treatment to him?- Who knows?
                                                    Murder is like 4 subjects- fail! College also restricts you attending classes if 4 subjects fail.
                                                    Someone in lungi does murder but changes clothes- police will still catch him- soul has body as cloth.
                                                    Lame, blind, etc are cuz of past life- how karma comes try to understand? Can't we punish in this 1 life?
                                                        He will improve himself- he will reform!
                                                        Poverty in not in india but everywhere.
                                                        Every soul is child of God- God doesn't act in unfair way.

                                                        We get results of what we sow- as you sow, so shall you reap!
                                                        How do you know he has done sth wrong? I have Malaria- what's proof that mosquito bit me? which mosquito!?
                                                            Indian standard time- what time it bit me?
                                                            I will give you proof- 1 Lakh 85 thousand- how much?
                                                            There is instant karma- Slap answered- You contemplate my answer, your question will be answered.
                                                            While I answer if you prepare for your next question, then you can't be answered
                                                            Generally I don't want to talk from egoistic platform.
                                                            Egoistic platform- we are in the mood of defeating each other. That never helps- honestly want to know Lord- you will get answer- answer should be heard attentively.
                                                            I am speaking on behalf of Guru, Sadhu, Shastra- I am giving answer for it- please hear it.
                                                            Remote karma- when eat pizza and stomach upset. Don't study in sem, flunk in exam.
                                                            College days- not good grades then no placements make you suffer.
                                                            Saved no money, when you suffer w/o money? Old age! Suffering instantly or 2-3 months or old age.
                                                            If there is quota of suffering to come, but die (prarabdha)- this balanced karma is aprarabha karma.
                                                            What we get is balance of pleasure and pain (1 package pain we can't bear)- so combination is arranged for future lives.
                                                                Chapatti atta we make gola for roti- so sanchit karma we finish off in lifetimes- 1 1 gola- pure suffering we can't tolerate- so combinatin is givento us.
                                                            Suffering will reduce as a devotee- obey God, sufferings are burnt out.
                                                            @Those who didn't do Homework, she was beating- 1 had approached teacher in advance admitting that guests had come so culdn't- no beating!
                                                                So our karma can be burnt off. Every moment we have chance to act aptly or not aptly- is it clearer now? Keep coming to classes- it will be more clearer.
                                                                why not whole college come for sankalpa not interested? It's not having a soul (in a pocket), you are the soul (not good, bad soul)
                                                                we have good dog, bad dog inside us- 1 we feed gets stronger- good and bad tendencies- how many agree?

                We gonna die but run after material stuff- come outta reincarnation cycle.

                    Pleasure analysis
                        Worldly delights
                            Don't get it- hankering
                                Eg- won kingdoms but still not satisfied in himself.
                            Get it- not as desired (lamentation), maintenance (anxiety of retaining pleasure), wanna increase/more (hankering)
                            still can't run away from
                                why? we do have desires.
                                how? while doing your duties, don't give up feet of God.
                        Real pleasure- is different from shadow.
                            It's the real home- how comfortable you feel there. constitutional for the soul
                                REL When you go home, you feel very comfortable- relatives praise you and parents talks. others home not very comfortable.
                                REL Birds also return home in even.
                            Taking care of porche car but not of driver
                                people rarely talk about soul- but fuss on mind, body, intellect
                                ppl committing suicide- US- 1200/day commit suicide and 20% successful.
                                It's cuz ppl don't know the goal of life- now dead end of life- now nth else- freedom from probs they think- more troubles start.
                                Philosophy of science- what is goal of life- why doing research? why making gadgets
                                    comforts => happy and nth more.
                    But preoccupied with immediate problems
                        Waiting for waves to stop?- study and then job- more responsible- wanna take care of them.
                        Spiritual goals compromised- In old age many ppl watch TV- interest doesn't come all of a sudden.
                            @If you don't save money now- problems later on.
                        Busy- e1 has 24 hrs- balance accordingly- take out some time for spiritual life.
                Is it not our responsibility to give education in place of food in slums
                    if we do that we will be distracted and won't be able to give what we stand for- spiritual welfare.
                    Best things we can do to a child is connecting him back to his father.
                        You give food, cloth- he continues to cry- the basic need is not being addressed.
                        there is dearth of social welfare organization- then why prasad- open an avenue to take interest. Kirtans, prasadam and Let them invoke an interest to hear.

                            supreme controller- difficult- Krishna is too simple. Vishnu so many universes.
                                    it's misfortune.
                                    Brahma saw dahi bhaat in Krishna's hands- searching for boys- you are my supreme father, but so deceptively simple.

                                wrong person gets credit and love and gratitude which would have helped the reader grow in love for Krishna.
                                It's a demoniac tendency. To be ungrateful and stealing.
                                stealing credit in real life!? 7 did it and I am taking credit!!

                    <Purpose>
                    Designed for purification of desires of Soul (not just satisfaction of desires or punishment)
                        indulge/ rather experience- realize their futility and come back.
                        @it's a prison (gotta work)- not a torture chamber (meant to give suffering)- both suffering and enjoyment for purification.
                        @It's a hospital- Get cured but patient has to be in alignment with instructions.

                        @Ant drowning in water, got boat. Jiva's fall into material world- boat is shelter and shore is sp world.
                            Guru is sitting on that branch- extending stick to give shelter.
                            Blinded by illusion- we don't know what will elevate and degrade.

                                        touching blue part of flame- naughty nature to put ourselves in trouble in conditioned state.

                                <Shraddha>
                                    Story- Price of fruits (HH Kadamba Kanan Swami)
                                        Distributing fruits thru basket- finished then come along to reservoir.
                                            some of them backed out.
                                            some of them lied down.
                                            oasis- water body- coconut- is it the place- some thirsty- drank water and climbed coconuts.
                                            sun tolerated- for more fruits- cooling breeze. You have reached.
                                            Tall wall- climb- get to other side and trees variety- offering in plates- eat AMAP.
                                            Analogues
                                                Person- SM, Diffn 
                                                fruits- procs of DS; different rasas of sp world (mango is heavenly food); 
                                                DS- easily give up DS (eg- movie, party, smoke-drink) cuz param drishtva.
                                                came back- succumbing to temptations.
                                                    ashraddhana purush (9.3)- faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection.
                                                        anything that comes my way is good for me (+ and -)
                                                    anything bad is also for my protection (sent by Krishna)- 5$ ed to child- heir (all property to you).
                                                        Smoking boy- no picket money. Upset- stared at father- say 50 crore and not giving 5 Rs (for ur own good I am doing so)
                                                        not allowed to be best- we will get 2 extra horns to enjoy (ppl display- not enough to be that inside)
                                                        chocolate adamant- teeth gone or will be- so denied.
                                                    sarva dharman shloka is also for neophytes- all sinful reaction is taken.
                                                        mischief is seen and gives troubled (using ur reactions)
                                                        troubled in DS are Krishna's creation- being destroyed.
                                                        Ramayan- tava asmi then all reactions.
                                                oasis- Heavens
                                                sincere devotees in sadhana
                                                    Big gate- sp world (SM has key)
                                                    how will I find out- I will find you out (you are ISKCON)
                                                        short interview also- name of das vs orissa ka raaja.
                                                        why enter in sp world? to serve.
                                                        hari guru vaishnav- for eternity.
                                        What was differentiating factor?
                                            Shraddha (komal vs staunch) causing the following
                                                Abhidheya not proper- officially engaged- doing out of sense of duty (not by heart)
                                                    @marriage heartily vs formality type- giving heart- taking services.
                                                Prayojan not proper- hidden motives (hidden cuz if exposed it will be disapproved)
                                                    not wrong in beginning
                                                        Eg- 7 evening programs- to save from cooking.
                                                        Eg- send me to abroad- international movement or employment.
                                                        Eg- good marital match here.
                                                        Eg- To RSP- How to get into IIT?
                                                    but purify else won't last.
                                                    !Eg- Devahuti- bathe, ornaments, herbal oils- perverted reflection of shampoo.
                                                        how will I get delivered?
                                                        3.23.57- material side- good marriage, clarifications, etc. I never asked for liberation.
                                                            why? getting to see futility of material desires in front of Krishna.
                                                            Dhruva M also.
                                                        Maharaj I am a baby. Grow up! can't expect 16 yr old to be lifted by mother.
                                    Division of devotees on faith
                                        1st class dev- know shastra, can quote and faith like trunk of a tree.
                                            no chance of fall down (nitya siddha, sadhana siddha)
                                            At least Nishtha stage is attained.
                                        2nd- don't know scriptures but firm faith that it's best course.
                                            nice movement- I will give heart.
                                            Diffl time falling down.
                                            inclined for mundane welfare activities.
                                            madhyam adhikaris are greater than this level.
                                        3rd- doesn't have faith (not scriptures very well)
                                                but due to association and simplicity (complicated brains)- so hangs around (follow up)

                                        different angles of vision of same thing- why so.
                                                analyse to make it sync- evaluate, think more (than reading more pages)
                                                absorption is more important.
                                        Eg- Narad, Shiva- facing probs in life

                    You are in this MMN when-
                        MOG
                            knowledge (you see reality the way it is-science,yoga), and act in that knowledge.
                                (REL sat- "what it is"- Jo hai- to see things as they are!)
                                cuz aligned no PAp and happiness. Prob- attachment to that happiness.
                                you use it to serve others (technology) by conditioning nature or environment.
                                Is conditioning not done for the purpose of gratification? Making it MOP? Service vs you want it for yourself- "what drives for action? knowledge!"
                            Fulfillment (making ecosystem of normal gratification(enjoyment) or analgesics) within quota is acceptable.
                                Here gratification is not so much on material layers. It is satisfaction of giving, love, daan; I made a difference- satisfaction.
                                    Enjoyment not in "I" but "made a difference"- independent "I" still exists, though.
                        MOP
                            attachment and hankering drives you. Gratification/Enjoyment is your objective.
                            The purpose of studying reality is to enjoy objects of gratification (not escape reality but accept reality)
                            Hanker for best gratification->work hard to get those objects.
                                    Eg- Ego gratification!
                                    REL rajas- royalty- "I am the king" feel.
                        MOI
                            Escape reality thru intoxication, oversleep, excitement time, etc
                                REL tamas- andhakaar- darkness. Don't show me light, reality- things as they are (cuz they suck maybe)
                            Why MOI? Karma but no phala makes one sick- I wasted my time.
                                Time is never wasted- you might have climbed up to 39% so continue from there- tapa pays and what else is option?
                                1 starts to hate hard work that it doesn't pay him up to his expectations. So, starts to hack into pleasure.
                                No! above all pleasing Krishna.
                        
                        1. Sattva – intelligence, imparts balance

                        2. Rajas – energy, causes imbalance

                        3. Tamas – substance, creates inertia


                        An environment is in a MMN when it stimulates corresponding emotions.
                        BKVS- Castes map to MMN. Sync with reality and pursuit.

                        Associate with the mode or people in that mode to cultivate that mode- Varnashram assists in this.

                                    If I don't, I put myself into suffering.
                                    MOI causes Degradation.
                                Desire
                                    You can fulfill your desires. Karma is a means to get there.
                                    You cultivate Seva Vritti from Bhog Vritti. @Salt in Sabji- Get Bhog but no bondage.
                                Duty
                                    VA is culture of India. Important enough spending one's life on.
                                        Society is doing so much for us. Gratitude- my time to pay my debts (of course, it is formal and no informal concern for oneself but participate in this mutual game)               	
                                    Krishna has advocated so in BG. It's MOI vs MOG.
                                Love            
                                    I can do anything +with my time- all time for SQ if I want.
                                        shastras don't approve of it. samaj can't run like this.
                                        Your nature needs engagement and service is your human need
                                    Will it please Krishna if I do brilliant and dovetail vs I ignore rather than not doing it in first place.
                                        Fear desire duty love- when disapproved by envt makes sure that you take shelter of SQ- why you doing it at all.
                                            helps you reflect on your vision/purposes. Connecting you back to your roots.

                                            first wrote SB 1st canto - sent to govt and respectable people and positive remarks from there
                                            BTG ppl started doing.
                                            BG
                                                    not famous author so plight. 
                                                    mcmillan - a clerk wanted BG for himself. 
                                                    Big guy - published all scripture but don't have hindu. 
                                                    long process then went thru it quite fast - 400-500 books hayagriva Pr cut short.
                                            Positive reviews from scholars also - SP started his own press - ISKCON press and BBT. That's what SP talks about.

                                    Original gives authentic, scholarly - on increasing demand.
                            Credits go to SM - originator being K (Credits / ACK)
                                    My credit is no adulteration - no personal ambition.
                                            vs personal agenda or ambitions.
                                                    Imperfect knowledge - put Krishna aside (banish, kill Krishna ??? asuri vritti) => bewilderment from mayavad => not enabled to btg.
                                            present will of Krishna - not scientific, political, philosophical treaty.
                                            Eg - become my devotee - Krishna and inside of Krishna - no difference (not a human assumption)

                                                    Not purpose but what importance 1 has. 
                                                    Confidence [in Krishna and transparency] - It implies that the book has that potential in it - hopefully someone can avail it.
                                                    Mood - 1 person becomes PD - that's SP's goal - not to become famous scholar, author - fulfill purpose of Krishna.

                            <About>
                                    was written with book
                                    directly focussed on content. Whole introductory philosophical nutshell.
                                    Only reference to Radharani in prayers in beginning.
                                    Style of Presentation
                                            SP in Intro - analysis - taking things separate 
                                                    analysis is for clarity of understanding and for functioning we need synthesis.
                                            Krishna's synthesis - how these points are connected together.
                                                    @ Newspaper - make it look like flow. Cricket and sw accident.
                                                    Scriptures present knowledge as synthesis mode - child is not taught as grammar basics, etc but culture.
                                                            BG is synthetic body of knowledge - acaryas give us analytic foothold.
                                    Importance in our context (KC ecosystem)
                                            BG is broad scriptural book - integrated paths talked about to declare supremacy of bhakti.
                                    Importance in Tradition
                                            LCM quotes a lot.

                                                    VCT is more rasika in many natures and Baladev mainly on philosophical tenets of sampraday.
                                            BVT wrote commentaries - added notes at several places - Vidvata ranjan (Delight in wise based on BV), rasika ranjan(relishers of mellows).
                                            SP wrote commentary - mainly from Baladev. Repeats and emphasizes how bhakti is essence.

                                                    Arjuna's difficult position
                                                            being associate is above ignorance

                                                    e1 is in difficult position
                                                            atmosphere of nonexistence (asat- which doesn't exist)

                                                    But not e1 does brahma jijnasa
                                                    this is so important that every activity is failure unless brahma jijnasa.

                                                    SPOG himself spoke - why we need anything else
                                                            others SB are just elaborations.

                                                            cuz so absorbed in mundane activities that not possible to read all vedic literatures
                                                            BG will suffice - has the potential.

                                            devotee and friend

                                                            submissive spirit = devotion - himself starts with prayers.
                                                            potency is when it's followed - what doctor meant when he says take in morning.

                                                            Yanti deva vrata devan - no mechanical process necessary
                                                                    but material inconveniences there also
                                                    kinda karma to do to gain relief from actions and reactions
                                                            takes MOG - sanity, activities to adopt.
                                                            akarma - 9 proc DS sadhana bhakti to do it.
                                                            sanatan dharma - not sectarian but eternal occupation.
                                                                    dharma - intrinsic nature and sanatan - emphasizes eternity.
                                                                            meaning - that which is constantly existing with it.
                                                                            find existential part of jivas which is constant companion and always exists.
                                                                            LCM on svarupa - constitutional position is rendering service to God.
                                                                                    animals serve humans, friend serves friend, mother serves son, wife husband, politician supposed to serve voters, voters serve by giving votes.
                                                                                    shopkeeper, artisan, capalist, family, state, etc

                                                                            Krishna isn't sectarian - we are intrinsically connected.
                                                                                    he is reservoir of pleasure and we are looking for it - connection is immense happiness.
                                                                    vs religion - can change cuz convey the idea of faith.
                                                                            belong to a particular faith as per TPC.

                                                                    vs Demigod worship - not approved - worship in lust
                                                                            no sanatan results
                                                                            Krishna advocated so in his pastimes - govardhan over indra - only him for his abode.
                                                                    @liquidity of water, heat of fire.

                                                                            of time - no beginning it always wsa. not the case with others.
                                                                                    jiva is eternal - never born, never dies.
                                                                            of species - business of all human, rather jivas.
                                                                    Demigod worship doesn't give sanatan results.
                                            Remember Krishna along with VA.
                                                    Inflammatory (immoral) eg of why love paramour - 
                                                            LCM practiced high morality.
                                                                    Gita Govind - heard sound - died if been there.
                                                            Convey the point
                                                                    promiscuity, affairs, extra-marietal affairs are facts of life - favorite list catches attention; not recommend but convey.
                                                                    no suspicion - duties until gets to meet paramour.
                                                                    Current situ
                                                                            we have material and spiritual duties - material is natural and spiritual is alien.
                                                                            but caught in shackles - internally thinking of Krishna while internally thinking Krishna.
                                                                    Intensity of eg ain't immorality but extent of intense remembrance.
                                                            Next line, purpose is condone morality. not give up material duties
                                                            Split personality - 2 lanes of consciousness - Bhakti integrates whole thing.
                                                            Bhakti is wonderful - engage all layers in K's service.

        Working of mind - BV gets cycle going.
            BJ - seed of desire (willing) - fueled thru association, idle curiosity, past karma. => pull on stimulus (potential of indulgence on ripe moment)
                    Soln - DS, JN, Streaks, YG, VA
                            JN - change willing by reading +ve of not doing and -ve of doing
            Keet - stimulus => tendency push, willing. Expression of contempt (worthlessness), insect.
                    It seems like an instance of Vritti. Vritti is something that exists potentially between consciousness and object of perception but keetam is push exercised in real time.
                    It is not feeling - but feelings intensify to culminate into Thinking It and influencing the other layers - arranging for gratification!!
                    Soln - Change context (pleasurable), Relationships, Outta sight and mind - locality of reference
                            overindulgence
            Action - 
                    Soln - Edge, start a new thread of cycle on planning to standardize and stabilize it;attention, standardization, lessons learnt, research
                    Subtle Impacts
                            skR - feels and thts on stimulus. culture [of mind], ritual
                            VrT intensify
                                    VrT - tendencies in general not specific to situ. (attitude - settled way of thinking or feeling about something, drishtikon, stipend, frame)
                            BV grows
                            Feedback loop for BJ.
                    Karmic reactions
                            Prarabdha - manifest
                            Aprarabdha - unmanifest
            #aptitude - a natural ability to do something
        DY
            Dharana - Focus on breath, bodily sensations, mantras, chakras or drishti are all forms of dharana, in which the mind is trained to fix on one particular subject or object.
                    observe patterns of the mind and to notice the interrupting thoughts, eventually leading to longer gaps between them over time.
            Dhyan - meditative state, one in which it is no longer possible to perceive the act of meditation or separate a sense of self from it.
                This is a state of mind when we are still focusing on driving but it is happening by itself unconsciously. We make fewer mistakes. This is called Dhyana or Meditation. 
            Samadhi - enlightenment
        Yoga
                KY - understanding of law of karma and acting in such a way that you don't get bound and you uplift yourself.
                        when work and service is what connects you to transcendence. Seeking the joy of life lived for others.
                        K - Law of equivalent exchange (economics)
                                Karma kand in this section. This K aligned to shastra.
                                safal - you get success at what you pick. You indulge yourself fully into work.
                JY - cultivating knowledge thru shastra about transcendence
                        J - cultivation and organization of any form of knowledge.
                                material knowledge from shastra can come under this. So, J can be in alignment with shastra or disaligned - not by correctness but by purose it serves.
                DY - cultivating absorption thru practice on transcendence
                        D - absorption in object of your interest.
                                thinking about what is suggested to you to think (by shastra or guru)
                BY - rendering devotional service to Godhead.
                        B - devoted to a cause.
                                devoted to causes deemed respectable by shastra.
                KJDB are necessary for life - you are in desert - so stop working will only make you suffer more.
                        what's needed is directing KJDB towards the direction of coming out of desert while continuing with KJDB of life - more as util than goal.
                        REL gotta go to restaurant. Gotta ensure the car is full tank petrol and air is fine, etc.
                        where's the hint for God? And where's the incentive to start considering it 
                                BG says 
                                        DaaS (Devotion as a Service)
                                                arto (trouble - who is out there to orchestrate or can anyone orchestrate solution beyond me), 
                                                artharti - what's the gain, opportunity, benefit here - It helps me materially and the promises in milestones are good bets (Shikshastakam)
                                                        also the wordly side - like I give presentations, my stage confidence will get better.
                                        Exploration
                                                jijnasa - what is it anyways. Curious. Explore this dimension. 
                                                        End result is not known but want the experience the road (not fruit but work) - what's the world view model.
                                                jnani (the model wins you) - it's consistent, intriguing, sensible, verifiable (in milestones of achievers).
                                                        sounds like when you are done with exploring and then find it interesting to go on.
                                                Experiences
                                Ascend - too much of KJDB takes you to the essence (doesn't align but shows)
                                        In all of KJDB - In J aarohan (shastra being a consistent and dependable model ;  ) you can find, in K, D (eth being tailor made), B. 
                                        Proof of pudding is in eating and seeing other examples of successful and shastra, etc.
                                        Yoga Ladder - Increase in services make you temperament suitable to see beyond the grats of life and sobriety necessary to realize the Spirituality model at work.
        Karma Yoga - everything offered to Krishna then taken else thief. Done as an offering and fruit is consumed as prasad.
                the whole concept of karma bandhan is addressed by Karma Yoga.
                Eg - offering food to Krishna
                Thievery - intervening into 7 else's life is problem - 7 else's quota.
                        Eg - that body belongs to that guy - so can't exploit his body without his permission - thievery.
                        Loving 7's daughter without permission is thievery
        Yama - self/avoids/free yourself from lower/mundane expressions that cause mental agitation. Things that spoil the environment for execution. @pouring water into fire.
                Satya - avoid illusion (creating or experiencing)
                Ahimsa - avoid anger (u and 7)
                Asteya - avoid envy/jealosy (karmic bondage)
                    REL a bargaining with richest man on earth - it can't be equivalent exchange
                        thievery mentality comes in vendor (pretend or make up charges - thievery/cheating)
                        I want him to pay more cuz he can. He has so much - I should also have some (jealosy)
                Brahmacarya - avoid lust (of all senses)
                Aparigrah - avoid greed (MSC - Minimum Simple Clean)
        Niyam - preparation or setting the environment for execution (configuring the property files in a software application)
                Shauch - Body Environment
                Santosh - Mind Environment
                Tapa - Intellectual Environment
                Svadhyaya - Ego Environment
                Ishwar Pranidhan - Spiritual Environment
        Yoga - you are within this world cuz of bandhan
                Bandhan exists at all the layers - 
                        senses clamor for grats, 
                        mind wants to be free, 
                        intellect conditioned to plan enjoyments (or find enjoyment in planning, execution or achievement)
                        ego conditioned with worldly identifications
                Yoga means to purify all the 4 layers - yes, it takes all layers to be purified.
                        DY - purify the mind - change the engagement from external to internal.
                        JY - purify the intellect - thru knowledge from nth to a proper un-corrupt kernel
                        BY - purify the ego - change from wordly identifications to spiritual identifications
                        KY - purify the senses (the desire to enjoy the fruits thru senses) - let fruits pass thru the channel of Lord for fruit to become prasad and work to become sadhana.
                                where's the bondage - not in desire, not in work, not in deserve, not in fruit. Bondage is in the desire to enjoy the fruit independently.
                                Desire --> Karma --> Deserve --otherfactors--> Fruit.
                                How good is philanthropy - it is good karma for sure. but is it akarma or even helps akarma? 
                                        good karma means that it is a higher expression of engagement (say, demigodly) - from oneself to others.
                                                in its new state - you may still want a reciprocation from people (law of equivalent exchange)
                                                but if say no expectation of reciprocation - satisfied in the service alone OR the happy faces you give - for now, this doesn't seem worldly
                                                        this can be accomodated in spiritual world but your attraction is once again not for Krishna but worldly happiness so maybe Brahman is right for you.
                                        but it's not intended to invoke love for God so how can it even get you there.
                                Misconceptions - don't worry about fruits focus only on endeavor - why endeavor at all then? cuz in love with the work. then fruit is in the endeavor not outta endeavor.
                                        this is higher expression of engagement where driving force of endeavor is the sheer love for it - eg pleasure of solving a trigonometry problem (FDDL)
                                                here the expression has moved from my mental pleasure to my intellectual pleasure - it is still worldly.
                                        is there any bandhan here or no bandhan - yes, bandhan here is not by fruit outta endeavor but fruit within the endeavor - you can't leave the engagement cuz of love.
                                        bandhan is not in desire cuz soul desires all the times it is only stone that doesn't desire.
                                                bandhan is by definition in perverted expression of this resource called desire (expression of consciousness within this world)
        Abhidhyeya - abhi + dhyeya (deserving attentions) - abhidheya means spoken of (jiski baat hui hai)
            dhyeya, dhyan, dharana - dharayati, dharti (pakad lena), dhi (intellect), dhimahi.
            material projection of stages of dhyan yoga 
                    accept favorable, reject unfavorable, create ecosystem (mind, intellect included), remove distractions for focus, hold onto it, intellect, being close to it.
            "Abhi" means to, towards, into, higher, about, new.
            prayojan - prakrista rupena yojan (perfect plan/purpose/vision or aage ki yojana - next plan)
            sambandh - perfect knot; closed knot (connected), sambandh ka ke ki (connection)
            samadhi - aggregate, settlement (set), bringing into harmony (aligned), putting together, close (metaphorically), close to above (sandhi vicched)

        Ramayan
            Use and throw - to demoralize vanar sena. it was ineffective day. but ram would perform rites
            we pray for service but more so service attitude.
            mimimal service and max returns is material world limitation - both server and client.
            bhavna + kalpana - makes angry combination - bharat coming with army.
            Ram said - bhavnayein to alankar hain but encourage those that take us towards dharma.
                    emotions give fuel to life. but are agitated in life so that we don't use intelligence (ads to paralyse intel until you buy)

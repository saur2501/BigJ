                    4 defects so need vedas
                        long ago and not valid some people - word of god always relevant @sun.
                        filters of knowledge - can't acquire knowledge properly cuz of progressive limitation to knowledge 
                                SUP CC
                                @closed doors
                                about - knowledge flows thru the sequence but input or rectification from bottom to top.
                                        specifically targetted to understand spiritual subject matters and try to reality
                                        REL faith in theory of evolution
                                vipra lipsa - cheating propensity
                                        conscious and can be rectified
                                        doctor the facts - made my mind, don't confuse me with facts.
                                        Darwin's theory is a suggestion not an observation.
                                pramad - illusion - error proned
                                        we don't even realise it (feeling based)
                                        coming from cold to hot or light to dark room. sugar to orange.
                                bhram - make mistakes
                                        Eg - currency notes counting.
                                        we can realise it and judgment based.
                                karna apatau - limited senses
                                    REL immediately the room becomes dark, you cannot even see your hands
                                    sun looks like disc size.
                                Eg - Gandhi - not a mistake but saved life so yes.
                                        contextual eg rather than eternal. Principles are eternal but eg are contextual - eg should only help us understand principe better.
                    universal and axiomatic wisdom
                        Vedas meaning multiple levels
                                Expansive level - all knowledge
                                Average sense - Vedic literature
                                     hindu is foreign name - real identification is varnasrama - 8 division (or 16 combinations)
                                     These divisions are everywhere - created by God.
                                        Brahmana - Intelligent Class.
                                        Kshatriyas - Administrative Class (next intelligent)
                                        vaisyas, the mercantile group
                                        shudra - worker class
                                Restrictive - only 4 vedas and itihasas and purana are not.
                        universal - applicable all times.
                            ?principles are universal but applications may not be
                                eg hypothetical - power of cow dung in home - you will probably not do that cuz of better facilities but fact still holds.
                        axiomatic - implicitly true - knowledge may not be wrong but perception is.
                            REL  cow dung is accepted as pure - counter-intuitive (take bath on touch) but research proves.
                            "as if written in vedas"
                            no need of research it is already established.
                                can do research but prefer saving time by accepting disciplic succession
                    superior to pratyaksha and anumana
                        about - not useless but recognized.
                        aaroh - inductive - conduct experiments and surveys and after seeing many may be you have not yet seen the man who actually is.
                            empiricism - sense perception
                            rationalism - mental speculation of perception
                        avaroh - deductive knowledge - e1 says man is mortal so accept.
                            rightly heard the Vedic message from the right source - else not bona fide.
                            be firmly established in Brahman
                            even vedas search hunt can get you baffled, so approach devotee - he can give Krishna like an object.
                    Vedic / Krishna only way to know transcendental realm
                        spiritual world can't be perceived with senses - microscope perceives on matter not resolution power.
                        @who is my father - better ask mother than DNA fingerprinting.
                            vedas are mother. Brahma is grandfather.
                            Vedic knowledge comes down by disciplic succession.
                                accept Krishna as he is - without interpretation.
                            accepting authoritative sources is perfect
                                @radio program guide we accept. Don't have to experiment.
                        3 ways to perceive vedic wisdom
                                agrees with pratyaksha and anumana
                                        Eg - vedic mathematics - same results but faster.
                                disagrees
                                        our focus not on that which agrees or not but on transcendental.
                                transcendental
                                        our prime focus - beyond proof and disproof - ?just beyond scope.
                                        beyond manifestation and non-manifestation - even experiments are not possible.
                    Krishna is ultimate goal of vedas

                    History of vedas and vedic essence
                        why written by Vyasdev
                            people not shrutidhar, less intelligent, sharp memories no longer
                        gave 4 vedas to 4 disciples
                        for sudra, stri, dvija bandhu (high born but not qualified) - Mahabharat and Puranas.
                            REL Concrete exposition of abstract concepts in vedas with many examples and enjoyable stories (fun listening)
                        forgotten to give most important message. SB then fully satisfied.
                            ?Gradual elevation so vedas cuz one can't take KC is its full blown state in beginner's level so inspiration at where they stand (like teach 2nd class student accordingly)
                        summary of vedas as vedanta sutra on narad's instruction but still not satisfied 
                            1st commentary by Vyasdev himself as SB.

                        standard vedic saying spoken on various occasion - consistent with the theme of first 3 Isho Verses.
                        articles in BTG during WW2 - not book directly published.

                        Central Idea is Material world is perfect (for its purpose)
                        complete is AT and world is complete that comes from but AT remains complete.
                        who he she it refers to is hidden - upanishads are puzzling cuz intellectuals like to stretch their minds.
                        INF - INF is INF.
                            @Set of All numbers minus set of all odd numbers is also infinite.
                                former is bigger set and subset - things don't remain simple when dealing with infinity.
                                but remainder is lesser but that's not case cuz material eg are imperfect.

                            SPOG is Complete AT
                                    no personal name - karma kand section idealize those who are materially very accomplished.
                                    jnana is 0 and upasana kand is +.
                                    family of parabrahman - impersonal light seems paradoxical - SP uses impersonalist terminology and takes them to personal conception.
                                            pure consciousness with nth else - subject or perceiver, object of consciousness and stream of consciousness.
                                            impersonal conception - object and subject are illusory but only consciousness is true. no perceiver no performer - no1 conscious that knows they are liberated.
                                            Isho itself takes people to personal conception.
                                    Levels of Realization - Realization of aspect of AT - Seeker called
                                            Brahman
                                                    Realization of Sat by Jnani
                                                            world is temporary but still longing for living forever - some arena where existence is eternal.
                                                            sweet has characteristics of fragrance, sight and taste.
                                                                    b4 tasting prasad it should captivate other ways - Kavi Karnapura says.
                                                                    tactile sensation just perfect.
                                                                    distance then only fragrance is accessible.
                                                                    only sat is realized - brahman is not sat - it is all but we realize only that aspect.
                                                            same non-dual aspects are being addressed differently.
                                                            like sweet is perceived differently by different perceivers.

                                                    Realization of Sat and Cit by Yogi
                                                    smell and seeing gulabjamun - you have moved closer to realization of sweet.
                                                    yogi level knows supersoul is conscious ew - of me and e1 else.
                                                    not object of devotion but object of meditation here.
                                                    there is contemplation and admiration but no devotion in form of service and pastimes.

                                                    Realization of Sat Cit and Ananda by Bhakta.
                                                    joy thru performance of pastimes. reciprocations in there.
                                                    all aspects of AT are realized here. interaction in endless love.
                            Material world is complete
                                    no extraneous body in world reqd to maintain the world.
                                    Theist - so much right. rains to nourish.
                                    Atheist - so much wrong. why rain in ocean. droughts and flood not benevolent arrangement.
                                    design is undeniable like cloud formation - automatic doesn't mean no existence of designer or operator but means that there's no awareness.
                                    Eg - toy moving is automatically - no operator is seen - no direct interference - design and control or control is delegated.
                                    perfect management that needs no supervision - constant supervision avoided is rather proof of good design - supersoul constantly sees but not active participation - arrangement of material nature goes. Processes go on on their own.
                                    writing book with cellphone - curse the maker - not meant for writing the book - facility for writing messages although distance call is primary.
                                            don't impose the purpose self-styled.
                                            world for our enjoyment then may seem imperfectly enjoyment.
                                            limited senses, few moments and old and death. world feel incomplete.
                                    both theist and atheist are right - arrangement of living and suffering - where in world do we see this
                                            a jail (medication but also suffering) doesn't mean it's not designed - punish and reform while providing.
                                            Hospital - arrangements but patients suffer but necessary for cure.
                                    Perfect factory - O2 and CO2 cycle this is dream come true - factories feed each other and ongoing profit
                                            only theory - waste as raw for other is only hypothetical.
                                            but biology shows that.
                                            material world serves its purpose so is perfect.
                            Human form offers complete facility
                                    human rights - not what animals get from nature but what no other humans can get.
                                    prisoner not given facilities or someone denied basic - even animal rights ESMD.
                                    st animals get that humans don't - that's regrettable but providing that doesn't fulfill right of enlightenment - not flash of light in head but understanding purpose of life and harmonization with that.
                                            we can think beyond ESMD is opportunity in human life.
                                    be a part and not apart
                                            our completeness is dependent and Krishna's completeness is independent.
                                            part then happy but apart then comes under mind and senses
                                            @hand as part enjoys but apart it can't do what supposed to.
                                                    it's complete but in connection with the body.
                                    Sense Gratification - Illusory Completeness
                                            SG keeps us incomplete, trying in vain to fulfill the mind's foolish fantasies and draconian demands.
                                            partner to make complete - 2 incomplete can't make complete.
                                            @child wants toy but can't be happy - fantasy
                                            draconian - you must give it to me.
                                    DS - real completeness
                                            DS makes us complete by connecting us perfectly with the complete whole
                                            supreme happiness is perceived there.

                                    How the Lord is the proprietor of everything
                                            fascinates e1 - eg Alexander wanted to be lord of earth at least what was known at that time.
                                            energy belongs to the energetic - eg I own speech I can speak loudly or softly in my control.
                                            matter and spirit are Krishna's energy and material world is all about that so under his control.
                                            our ownership transitory - only lifetime, nature takes away and have limited control. Eg tenants can be vacated. Also, Farmer's land can be taken away by king.
                                            I see only nature - eth has to have source - if eth came by chance, no example.
                                                    chance of dice falling - ?in absence of any other knowledge - bridge collapsed by chance isn't a good explanation - possible candidates doesn't explain process.
                                                    chance as causal principle is misleading.
                                                    eth comes from sth as per our experience.
                                                    may have speculations from where eth came from 
                                                    turn to scriptures for that sth
                                            ICO - In care of not my property - so we remind ourselves.
                                    Eg of 1's quota in nature - like animals take their quota
                                            cow gives milk but doesn't drink it.
                                            lion doesn't eat grass and cow only grass - people distort nature by feeding flesh in grass to cow and leading to mad cow disease.
                                            cow is not milk making machine like petrol machine - feels secure then metabolism makes them give more milk.
                                            calf is given sufficient milk and remaining is taken for calf.
                                    Eg of quota in human possession of the earth 
                                            dwelling - ingredients from nature so from Lord.
                                            @carpenter doesnt' become owner for manipulation of material.
                                            factory material from Krishna so you are thief - no I give donation - then small thief.

                                                            Shastra - work and quality not just birth (ack, teach and live shastra) - those who know brahman.
                                                            aka bhudevas - gods on earth. anomalies on earth cuz don't seem to belong here where e1 else focus on themselves.
                                                                    don't involve with admin of world directly to avoid entanglement.
                                                    Kshatriyas - 
                                                            Material Realm - involve in material realm. Owner but devoted to king of all kings. Eg - Jagannath Rath Yatra.
                                                            Naradevas - representative of gods among human beings.
                                                            Shastras - live as per shastra else shastra (chhitar)

                                                    outcast - not so much by birth but quality.
                                            Comparison
                                                    vs communism - eth belongs to people (no god ack)

                                                                    => Talent not rewarded.
                                                                            => People become lethargic
                                                                    => Most people live in scarcity and so stay dissatisfied.
                                                            administrators are considered more previliged.
                                                    vs capitalism - allows wealth to determine position and power.

                                                            eb greedy for money => eb dissatisfied.
                                                    vs VA
                                                            Integrates absolute spiritual equality of all people with the relative material diversities

                                                            harvesting has festive atmosphere - people have smiling face
                                                            slaughtering horrific atmosphere - people have grave face.

                                                                    almost never to see slaughtering

                                            SP point is not about being vegetarian but eat according to quota.
                                                    be a prasadian - perfection of life is not to just avoid karmic entanglement
                                                    it is to acknowledge and love the Lord.
                                                    Krishnatarian is not a word used by SP and it is rasabhas kinda word - eat Krishna.
                                                    acknowledge the lord - harmony - thank and accept my gratitude.
                                                            thanksgiving - grace of lord in past.
                                                            every culture has it at least in past.
                                                    offer food to him - cleanse food of all karmic reactions
                                                            and filled with Krishna's purifying potency. It is bhakti free.
                                                            Prasadam prayer - by giving prasadam purify my senses to approach you. for elevation.
                                                                    not thanks for survival - I would have died without it.
                                            Humans are omnivores
                                                    canines are few - meat small part of diet if at all.
                                                            kali - 1/6 part can be eaten and mams - so I will be (allowed but regulated)
                                                    massive slaughterhouse where millions of animals killed scientifically is unprecedented.

                        can desire to live 100 years; working like this not bound by karma and no substitute
                            why then desire - ignorant and sinful then more bondings so long life means more suffering in future.
                            no other way - means no intelligent way to live - @how to go to 0th floor from 100th - lift but can jump.
                        Sections - flow - bandhan, liberation key, liberation guide, add god, center god, dovetail altruisms.
                            How Karma Bandhan causes death
                                Soul is eternal. Sunlight illuminates body or ether space but experience death cuz of attachment.
                                @Audience shocked when hero dies when hit by a chair. So, soul is traumatised cuz of misidentification.
                                    Movie for entertainment but happens to be horror movie.
                                    soul to material world to enjoy and karma to get mat enjoyment - more id with body, more pain.
                                soul suffers mortality cuz of attachment.
                            Human life offers liberation thru akarma
                                perceive higher reality.
                                about - word karma means - action, reactions, law of karma, good karma.
                                3 types of karma - 
                                    karma - act as per scriptures (prescribed duties)
                                    vikarma - misuse of freedom to lower life forms (meat then become tiger)
                                    akarma - action with no reaction - which free one from cycle of birth and death.
                                        @activities on behalf of god - like army shooting on govt behalf medal but neighbor then arrest.
                                In conditioned state can't adopt DS completely and can't stop fruitive work completely.
                                    Is spiritual life supplement (extra) or complement (it completes like vitamins)
                                        neither - it is replacement - material life is artifical and spiritual is natural.
                                        initially it is optional activity that you may or not do - but actually it is complement even there.
                            Vedas lead ultimately to akarma - 
                                Vedas give religion at multiple levels - @iron fist in velvet glove hit hard although seem  pleasing.
                                isms attractive forms of karma bandhan.
                                    nation - then same country with different species. Doesn't give liberation. 
                            Begin by bringing God into sense-gratificatory life
                                not irreligiously but god centered.
                                SG + God = Karma Kanda (Religious Materialism - entry point for most)
                                Altruism + God = Spiritual altruism (share KC with world - indian id see outsiders are preaching; giving up all material grats)
                                    SP - whole world becomes hindustan - Our indianhood engaged in KC. Americans do sth great - same thing.
                                Spiritualize apara dharma - soul concept then kaunteya and bharata to tolerate
                                    same idea - bodily designations illusory but can't wish it away - use it to elevate.
                                    you in great dynasty - act in great way. Use material id and pride with it - to make in respectable elevating ways.
                                Don't massage or pinch false ego, pat it along spiritual journey.
                                    India is great in whole lecture; india is useless, corruption and traffic and nothing to do with India - gritting and denigrating. Jolts them at that state.
                                    SP inspired akhadas - like hanuman remember ram and do it. Brahmanas we produce and you Kshatriyas for great administrations of society.
                                    Free distribution of food - stool and continue with ignorant material existence - shocking that person and goes away 
                                        daan for mind and soul is greater than body so give prasadam - offered Lord - purifies mind and awakens soul and some religious person will agree.
                                        kindergarten of spiritual life - can't push them to "give up eth for God" - they give up spiritual life - elevate gradually - there are levels.
                                        0s without 1 have no value - God adds value.
                                Grihastashram - nothing wrong - put God in center that's all. Don't say negative things about it.
                                    from independent life to gradually fully accepting god in life.
                            Without God, everything is in vain
                                flourish with god, perish without god.
                                no loss on this path and smallest advancement solves greatest danger.
                                humble god centered life > famous altruist. Good but not good enough.
                                what's use of living long life like veg - life valuable not by length but content - LCM, Jesus, Shankaracharya.
                                    content + length is glorious like ramanujacharya.
                                breathing normal - @bellows of blacksmith - worldly things I do - even animals do.
                            Make all altruism into Karma yoga
                                benefactory activities Krishna centered.
                                even incomplete then human life (BG says incomplete on this path then continue from there)
                            Misc
                                SP not directly speaking BY but KY - war capturing other country is very gradual. Gradually elevating people.
                                NOD for more details. Isho is very intimate BY study but here KY is focussed for a reason.
                                material nonsense to bring god - scriptures for more details - not facilitator but goal
                                    KK idea is I perform pastimes here and God you assist me in my pastimes.
                                    PDS is Krishna performing pastimes and we gotta join in his pastimes.

                    <T3> - How living in disharmony with the principle harms
                        meaning - asuri worlds attained by killers of souls.
                            like parent warning children if you don't study then fail, in turn poverty, ignonymity with no acceptance.
                        Section Flow - Terms intro (demon, soul killer), semantics of shloka - liberate self (human facility don't waste, no dimunition on path, external obstacles, solve real probs)
                        Terms Intro
                            Who is demon - asura means ignorant.
                                Etymology like historically may not be precise but semantically they are.
                                    Eg - Lexicographer.
                                Asu + ra - life air, enjoyer - enjoy the material, sensous way is asura.
                                Teeth coming out and horns from head - may not be there. Terrible forms also like Ravan episode but not so in MB.
                                    asura is not a form but mentality.
                                    local politician, grocer, neighbor, ourselves can be demon - demoniac mentality if not curbed then it grows.
                                    asuras have cosmic geography also.
                            Who is a soul killer
                                figurative expressions - soul can't be killed in BG (avinashi), atmanah also in 15th chapter - destroy the soul.

                                    REL - Lust may make me forget the spiritual consciousness of soul.
                                    Mukhya vritti (abhida vritti) vs gauna (lakshana) - central and symptomatic meaning
                                        arbitrarily taking non-literal ain't ok
                                        Independence time, BG for political motivation - took only metaphorical side of it - SP didn't like that.
                                        3 levels of readings by Madhvacharya
                                            literal - events as historic. Purify.
                                            ethical - moral benchmarking. We should not be like maricha. Guides in present.
                                            metaphorical - 8 sons of devaki - 6 children as anarthas then SM then Krishna appeared. Chlidren actually appeared but story made into allegory or analogy.
                                                Vedanta Deshika - Soul Sita turns away from soul then Ravan mind catches the soul.
                                                It should supplement not supplant literal - except until literal leads to absurdities. Eg - boat on the river (bank)
                                kill soul's real life
                                    atmaha in SB - Human form like boat and SM, etc but not taking advantage.
                                    shaastra then spiritual desire; mundane literature then mundane desire.
                        Shloka focus - Liberate the soul, don't kill it
                            higher facilities wasted - life below animals, hell in next
                                scientific advancement changes form but not purpose of activities.
                                    REL - gorging on refuge in garbage pile vs titillate tongue with processed packaged foods.

                                                AIDS - acquired intel.
                                        Our only focus in current time is on economics and even that's not taken career.
                                            promising career from premier inst like IIT - flunk if not studied. 
                                            Eating vs study balance - primary worry is study but if eating becomes the focus or no care - we suffer in either case.
                                            ESMD like other species need to be done in human life also but not primary focus.

                                UNESCO - worked so many areas but failed still - higher level of consciousness solves problem - material probs, spiritual solution.
                                We practice spirituality not to avoid hell but raise ourselves and thereby helping others.

            <IshvaraUnderstoodBySpiritualVision>
            T4To8 - The Ishvara can be understood by spiritual vision (how to connect) - it has 2 parts (?head and heart - the next sections)
                FOT - Inconceivable Lord, start with events and people, further into ishvara (first world then beyond world)
                <T4To5> Ishvara is inconceivable to our normal intelligence.
                    Meaning - AT is Fixed in one place but faster than mind. None can approach so far. Run to catch he leaves them far behind. though in 1 place he controls all suppliers.
                    T4 Sections Flow - understand not by speculation, but revelation, bhed abhed in God energy, God's mercy reveals himself, But gotta play our part.
                        AT can't be understood by speculation
                            speculation is uncertain. No positive description about God - form, etc - basically incomprehensible.
                            finite can't understand infinite but infinite can reveal (it can do that being INF)
                        Revelation helps us understand God and his energies
                            @sun rises gradually but our realization of it is sudden.

                                    @Grammar 
                                        Eg - child learns - e1 speaks around - Papa is noun later told. Don't start with grammar for 4 months toddler.
                                            First synthesis or functioning to learn and analysis is making sense.
                                        analysis is for systematic understanding.
                                    REL KC attracts by not just theoretical propositions but living demonstrations of devotee.
                                        there may be reasons but synthesizing - Krishna is center, want others to come to Krishna, etc.
                                    working - synthesis, why computer works so well - then analysis - help us understand the workings.
                            Fire burns - fire and burn are together and related but not same - if they were same could just say fire.
                                fire is source of energy and burning is action of energy.
                                Lord and his energies are same and different.
                        As we are limited, we can understand the unlimited only thru his revelation

                                CS - singing ability as seen by others - question is whether it's a part or apart.
                                    Materialist - jeena yahaan marna yahaa, iske siva jaana kahaan.
                                    Spiritualist - temporary and eternal worlds and temporary is means to get there.
                                        Mundane songs expand illusion - using talents is good but increasing illusion for everybody.
                                        talent in man krishna says - so it's not false.
                                    Impersonalist - You, I and singing talent are all illusions.
                                our part is Varna Ashram - Varna for body and ashram for soul (?ashram is for mind. Classifications as per suitability for spiritual evolution but place as per subtle body state)

                                        cuz all are different is not proud but fact of nature. Even in spiritual world, unique and relationship is unique with Krishna.
                                            individuality not to be negated but engaged.
                                        SUP - Individuality - London beachhead for spreading at that time - SP getting reports
                                            any assignment for me - what do you want to do for Krishna; try to understand the philosophy.
                                            made many mridangas in lifetimes that won't break.
                                            in harmony with principle of KC - not whimsical - SM doesn't think of eb nature to guide so learn and try yourself.
                                            VA is defunct and cross marriages and no specialization so this is best approach.

                                        ACT Don't wait for Krishna to come tell you what to do. If deity were to ask you what service are you doing?
                                            ye yatha maam - Krishna's greatest blessing is Krishna himself not opulence.
                                        Freedom then why push - Push how much
                                            @car key doesn't work then push required so initial momentum. can't go on.

                                        Freedom but conformity - Losing individuality? - Doing what others do - will I lose by individuality - individuality ain't based on externals.

                                            bhakti doesn't reject but sublimate our individuality.
                                    VA means from our place, at our pace, join the race.
                                        place - conditionings; pace - degree of seriousness and ashram, etc.
                                we want to cooperate with Krishna's plan.
                                    @patient with Doctor - so dev with Krishna's plan.
                    T5 Meaning - walks but doesn't; far but close; inside but outside.
                    T5 Section Flow - inconceivable, far but near, deity worship, nirguna saguna, pervades but separate.
                        Supreme must be inconceivable
                            AT is not illogical but trans-logical
                                below logic not, above logic - doesn't make sense or doesn't stand scrutiny of logic 
                                SUP - like I am god and I am queen of england.
                                many reject AT as illogical but need to rise to see it as trans.
                            Let logic but our ministers not masters
                                @torchlight helps see the way but not useful to search sun - scope is in night.
                                sun rises then need of torch doesn't remain. don't deny the role of logic - when we don't know what's what.
                                AT is greater than logic also.
                                @Doctor for treatment - evaluate the treatment - amputate leg for stomach pain is illogical.
                                    Just understanding the reason of cure doesn't cure me - not a substitute for experience - helps separate spirituality with pseudo.
                                    blind cure to see - eyes recovery - just understanding not enough; treatment will enable him.
                            Don't make logic into a secular god - logic ain't greater than god.
                        How AT is far yet near?
                            Contradiction vs paradox
                                contraction - opposite statements that don't make sense.
                                paradox - opposite seeming statements that make sense at deeper level.
                                Eg - Least corrected papers are most correct
                            3 manifestations brahman, paramatma and bhagavan 
                                paramatma is closest to e1.
                                but as bhagavan he is very far away.
                                SUP - Brahma samhita - even at speed of mind travel can't reach Krishna's toes.
                                SUP - Shvetashvatara Upanishad - Brahman so doesn't walk no hands and legs but accepts food. No ears but hears. no eyes but sees.
                                    all transcendental.
                        Science of Deity worship
                            To say that God can't appear as matter is to limit him.
                                Iconoclasts - delight in breaking deities.
                                You limit god - no, that he can is his unlimitedness.
                                Accepts limited form but stays unlimited.
                            @Elephant sits down so that child can touch its head - this comes from Ramanuja parampara.
                                Elephant has height but chooses to sit.
                                He manifests even as pastimes in material realm - but still unlimited in terms of his mercy and accessibility.
                                God doesn't delight in exhibiting his greatness that no1 can access him but facilitate access.
                            God can convert matter to spirit as vv cuz all his energies and he can.
                                can't move, talk or move fly - purpose of deity is not majesty or omnipotence but accessiblity - so keep purpose in mind.
                                opportunity of devotees to remind and service - not serving deity properly when fly is seen.
                                this manifestation follows the laws of material nature.
                            Access thru Wisdom - sacred Books
                                sacredness of scripture in some religions and they may delight in desecrate the deities and broken claiming what was sacred.
                                    now the books can also be burnt being made of material elements so does the text not remain sacred
                                    sacredness of scripture is not by its fire proofness but thru wisdom that's there in it for transformation.
                                Krishna appearing as book was accessiblity thru wisdom; deity is by form.
                            Omnipotence thru time 
                                Famous dictator - fisting at sky b4 death but nothing happened. Death manifestation of Lord.
                            deity vs statue - made as per scriptural description. BVT 3 levels.
                                Jada-maya - Just a statue. like politicians etc. Just a stone shape. Beginners see it as that.
                                Mano-maya - A symbolic representation. God is formless but ascribe form to feel emotions.
                                    @Flag to elicit patriotic feelings. evoked. Flag is symbol for sth abstract nationhood.
                                    Impersonalists like this way of vision. Ishta devata is valid concept - different forms of Lord or Krishna that's dear to us.
                                        Think - Ishta devata is a tool to rise above it. Distorted idea. Start with guru - caricature impersonlism.
                                    May have form but means to end goal - nothing intrinsic.
                                        let's say tricolor at present - agriculture not a problem so remove green. Can't govt do it - they can.
                                        na tasya pratimasti - no representation of AT - we can't ascribe forms to AT based on imagination on forms.
                                        @wallet with photo of another woman - thinking of you only but decided to change the picture.
                                            person and form's photo has some connection - representation based on that reality.
                                        Deity is photo of God? - no better understanding but Krishna all pervading and not any other person but SPOG so he can manifest anywhere.
                                            devotees pray to manifest and prana pratishtha and made as per description then krishna manifest.
                                Cina-maya - Non-different manifestation of the AT.
                                    Krishna deity is Krishna - Krishna has chosen to manifest as deity.
                                    SUP - SB - names, etc can't be understood with gross senses but senses starting with tongue Lord chooses to manifest.
                                    SUP - SP - same deity will later talk to you.
                            ye yatha maam is Krishna's approach.
                        Nirguna yet saguna
                            nirguna - no material qualities; or guna also means MMN - no material modes of material nature.
                            impersonalists like no material qualities.
                            which meaning is right?
                                Jiva G - AT description there is some qualities talked about in scriptures - unlimited, all pervading, blissful.
                                So, MMN is more scriptural than qualities.
                            SUP SB 8.3.8 - Gajendra verses seem like impersonal prayers (nirguna) but person Lord comes. So both are same.
                                transcendental qualities - arupaya rupaya - has no form, many forms - transcendental qualities.
                                ?Eg - Renunciation doesn't mean renounce Guru's orders and Krishna also - but only material realm - so contextual things are there.
                        How Lord pervades eth yet is separate
                            Eg- Prahlad Nrisimha - Is lord ew yes - in pillar yes - comes out and defeats - prahlad M doesn't pay obeissance to pillar but Lord.
                                Lord pervades everything but transcends everything.
                            Eg - Krishna's mouth had universe and same telecast but they were in universe - paradoxical
                                existence not reduced to everything but transcends it.
                            SUPP Vasudev sarvam iti - but they surrender to vasudev not to everything!
                            Schools
                                Pantheism - everything is God.
                                Panantheism - God is everything (pervades) but God transcends everything.
                            God is within and without.
                </T4To5>
                <T6To7> - First develop spiritual vision by seeing worldly things, events and people with equanimity.
                    T6 Meaning - sees e1 as atma, and trans Lord in them never hates any being. 
                        so beyond dualities of likes and dislikes
                        SUPP SB - Maharaj Nimi in 11th canto.
                    T6 Section Flow - stages of devotee, oneness vision.
                        Stages - first only Lord, then Lord and his relationship to everything, everything spiritually.
                        Kanishtha - means junior. Worships deities but not interested devotees. Relp with Lord understood but not devotees.
                            some attraction but not deep. Prakrit devotee - material nature - or materialist devotees.
                            doesn't see God's presence in relation to the world. Such person quarrels also cuz material conceptions.
                            Person categories - Attachment Matter X Krishna - 10, 00, 11, 01.
                                Materialist, Mayavadi, Sahajiya, Devotees.
                                Mayavadi experiences dryness cuz no pleasure from happiness from either place.
                                Attachment to Krishna but that to matter keeps dragging Sahajiyas.
                                PD or aspirants - detached from matter.
                        Madhyama - ishwar prema, servants maitri, innocents kripa, envious neglects.
                            SP always emphasized devotees so we start with madhyama ideally in ISKCON.
                            More they hear Krishna's glory their envy increases so avoid their offence and self contamination also.
                            Primary understanding - my relp with Krishna depends on many other factors - Krishna is related with everything else.
                                like relp with friend is also with their parents, foaf, etc.
                                expansion of God consciousness happens. Blasphemy happens somewhere - prefer leaving that place.
                        Uttama - everything is seen as spiritual essence 
                            preacher goes back to madhyama - cuz e1 seen as devotee then can't preach; gotta see them as innocents in need of spirituality.
                            everything is in Krishna's rasa lila some directly some thru mahamaya dancing to Krishna's tune.
                            philonthropic - equal vision is artificial cuz people are. Eg - Brahmana given tools or mindlessly e1 given books.
                                even freedom fighters used BG to use oneness which is, strictly speaking, not exact import.
                        Oneness - false vs real
                            bodily oneness is false
                            accept bodily diversity, realize spiritual unity.
                                looks, speech, intellectual ability, beauty is different.
                                humanitarian or humanism - all are equal.
                                    alone not enough cuz can't deny that they are different.
                                    teacher teaches e1 but not e1 performs equally well.
                                diversity exists in material realm. So VA accepts material diversity but engagement for evolution.
                                VA underlying principle - Spiritually e1 is equal, materially e1 is different.
                                @If I embrace tiger taking them to be equal - I will be in the belly of tiger.
                            anupashyati - see as per shastra.
                                Eg - southward graph - economist says recession. So, knowledge.
                                Eg - Light ray's path shifted - black hole.
                                Seeing is believing is a permanent progress stopped - intellectually and behaviorally.
                                    inferred principle from common sight - gravity seen in falling apple as if was first time but no1 saw that.
                                    it's a preliminary view of seeing. 
                            shastra has 1 message.
                                SUP Madhvacharya - veda eka vakyata - 
                                    scripture is omni-form - not uniform or multiform - all forms are there - instructions to people of different levels and don't work for others.
                                        doctor telling how much sugar is ok - doctor is partial to you allowing sugar.
                                        Quoting saying that MB or Ramayan eating meat - Vedas talk about it - concession but not instruction.
                                        This one can see when anupashyati.
                                    multi-level message seems contradictory to the uninformed but is seen as complementary by the well-informed.
                            liberated person's vision is truly beneficial. Artificial oneness.
                                SUP SP - why not pandita sama darshinah you apply; see e1 equally - see the shloka can you see criminal equally - skeptic long ago so mistake - see first fault with me and now with Vyasadev
                                    judging contents with scriptures with qualifications. Reality at certain level but not at current level of consciousness or social functioning.
                                    teacher saying all students are one.
                                    oneness so cobbler is same as teacher so please teach me engg - in terms of learning you need qualified teacher. Find right teacher. Discerning and distinguishing so madhyama.
                                    Teacher does not discriminate that's his equal vision and desires well being but what one can do other can't this is fact and needs to be ACK.
                                    SP going to USA to preach itself is his equal vision.
                                All paths lead to one goal - yes hell in current age.
                                SUP SP - if they think you are black and you agree then how are you different - both seeing on bodily platform.
                                    rise to higher level of consciousness. eventually became leader in devotee community.
                                SUP SP - Africa preach to Africans; Indians are emigrants - preach to them also but focus on them.
                                    bodily discriminations there but e1 dancing - well received classes - develop not in ways like west, develop spiritually.
                                SUP SP - message for australia - like for others, you have forgotten god and loving God will make you happy.
                    T7 Meaning - Title - rise from mistaken oneness to real oneness.
                        seeing jivas as spiritual what's illusion and lamentation or anxiety.
                    T7 Section Flow - Oneness word is feast for impersonalists.
                        Oneness between energy and energetic eg fire
                            Upanishads focus on impersonal aspects more.
                            I am spiritual - 1 with AT means separate from material.
                            I am detached brings pride but quantity subordination brings humility.
                            Impersonal path emphasises quality and Personal devotion path on quantity.
                            SA progression also first humility exalted then detachment in SA4 and then ahead.
                            Bhagavan and Shakti - Fire and Light. Sun god, radiance antaranga shakti, tatastha being rays. reflection bahiranga.
                                all 3 come from sun and energy of sun but don't manifest sun's power to same degrees.
                                antaranga is conscious. Tatastha shows lesser power and reflection has no heat, and reduced light.
                                gradation of energies.
                            Oneness in Diversity but also diversity in oneness.
                                All are souls and equal but next step in evolution is all souls in unity are not clones but individually unique with unique relationship.
                                Eg - Rasa Dance - gopis were united but uniquely individual.
                                Gopi Geets - no rehearsal b4 for chorus but different prayers by different individual gopis says Jiva.
                                So oneness is not boring but very rich in variety.
                        Oneness is in quality, not quantity like drop of ocean.
                            River going to ocean - it's not just merging but meeting.
                            Flow aspect - let my heart flow to Krishna.
                            Lord's perspective (Kapil Dev) - My dev hear about me - consciousness drawn to me.
                            Dev's perspective (Kunti M) - My consciousness should flow to you.
                                VCT - River to Ocean - River holds nothing back and Nothings hold river back.
                                    Dev holds nothing back and nothing holds dev back - River passes beyond the obstacle - sideways, eroded by, etc.
                                    external probs and internal probs.
                                    Can't chant? Manas seva, chant in mind, etc.
                                Difficult situation - hostile culture
                                    Sunday feast in Jail in USA when sheriff arrested.
                                    No shortage and no digestive problems.
                                    Crazy but happy.
                                SP - lecture on death bed.
                                Yajnik Brahmanis - River must stay with ocean. Yes your heart with me but married so request to go back - social obligations but heart remains.
                                2 individuals but constant meeting of heart.
                            oneness in darkness but light then variety.
                            Object X Vision (Material 0, Spiritual 1) = Consequence X Example.
                                00 - Bondage - People attracted to sense object. Sex machine, ATM machine.
                                01 - Purification (Util is principle) - SP - Flatbed truck for Rathyatra.
                                    Hippies liked wild thing and this was wildest for them - cultural fest with ancient tradition so no arrest now.
                                    Not artificial cuz material energy belongs to Krishna and should be connected - lakshmi for Narayan seva - eg hanuman.
                                10 - Offence - Deity worship as idolatory 
                                    Narki buddhi - made of material elements but not just - Krishna has manifested.
                                    Vaishnave jaati buddhi - My SM is advanced cuz born is brahmin family. Skin and background but sold heart to Krishna for decades.
                                    to highlight material at exclusion of spiritual is offensive.
                                11 - Purification Ecstasy - Deity as Krishna.
                                    faint in ecstasy and fall on seeing deity but at least ritually.
                                Observation - so material vision always creates problem.
                                    doesn't mean whitewash eth as spiritual - many spiritual teachers in USA emphasized aham brahmasmi even popular among many.
                                    but the application of aham brahmasmi by SP.
                                    I am soul so give up SG - if worldly pleasures and desires then repetition doesn't help much.
                                    discrimination is important - what's material and spiritual - potential to be engaged in spirituality as evolve.
                                    Material energy meant to be engaged in Krishna's service - we are not against technology.
                                    Some are against money - lakshmi devi is meant to be engaged in Narayan's service - Hanumanji brought Sita back.
                                    Not every material is usable in Krishna's service - eg poison can't be used but prasad is possible.
                                Ekatvam vision - every soul has potential to be Krishna's devotee.
                                    BSS's disciples - too much in MMN and can't be corrected.
                                    SP - plz gimme words to make them understand. Beyond conditionings to their souls.
                                    they have spark that needs to be fuelled by devotees maybe in book distribution.
                        Oneness in interest brings enjoyment Eg family, nation.
                            separate but united in purpose and oneness of purpose.
                        Separate interests cause shoka and moha
                        Become one in interest with God.

                <T8> - This vision developed further and directed to the ishvara helps us understand him.
                    Meaning - Must know God as unembodied, omniscient, pure, self-sufficient, philosopher, desire fulfiller.
                    Section Flow - 
                        Unembodied and Ashnaviram (without veins)
                            na tasya pratima asti (Svetasvatara upanishad 4.19) - no likeness of him - nth to compare trans form to (Baladev V) vs no form.
                                All analogies - bimba fruit and lotus are to give us idea.
                                Rupa G's Lalit Madhav has king saying - I thought I was glorifying you with choiced poetry but after beholding you - it seems that I was insulting - like calling king of world as emperor village.
                                Glorification becomes minimization of it.
                            Hermaneutic - method of understanding - 
                                arthapatti (postulation) - infer 3rd statement that resolves 2 contradictory statement
                                    Eg - Ravi doesn't eat thru day and weight increasing => must be eating at night
                                    Eg - Gajendra - arupaya and ururupaya - God has no form and many forms - so no material form and n spiritual forms.
                                    Eg - Shvetasvatara upanishad (3.19) - no eyes but sees - has spiritual eyes.
                                    LCM uses it with Saurvabhaum B and Prakashanand Sarasvati.
                                        glanced and created - senses and eyes come later after material existence then which glance created it.
                            kaya means body 
                                has connotations that don't apply to Lord's form.
                                    gay party 50 years back - cheerful party but today it means homosexual.
                                    ass - an animal vs another part of body's anatomy.
                                is separate from real person or soul.
                                    Disembodied - ghosts are disembodied.
                                    Unembodied - never had a material body. Eternal body.
                                    Soul gets embodiment for a life.
                                has to be given up in due time.
                                tends to degrade the soul by stimulating bodily desires.
                                is a product os soul's past karma.
                            you are giving interpretation cuz you are personalist.
                                That's possible. Let's analyse.
                                Ashnaviram besides akayam - what's point left to say that has no veins.
                                    subset needs no mention once superset is said.
                                    if say he had no clothes - no need left to say no tie.
                                    so can't simplistically translated.
                                no material body but has a body which has no veins.
                        Shukram - omnipotent
                            Qualification + Bestowal 
                                qualified to be a judge then given approval. Degree after exam.
                                Prahlad M - Apparent protector is not actual protector. Medicine does not always work. Boat but still dies, etc.
                                    necessary material arrangements are not sufficient or enough.
                            Karmavad vs Daivavada
                                Karmavad - Everything is in my hand. Secret of success they think.
                                Daiva - Nothing is in my hand.
                                Neither 2 makes complete understanding and has flaws. Frustrations or fatalism etc.
                            Karma + Daiva -> Phala.
                                Dronacarya - not able to capture Yudhisthir - endeavored fullest but bestower sits on Arjuna's chariot.
                                Dhritarashtra - if destiny that dynasty gets destroyed
                                    Vidura snaps back cutting thru illusion - destiny determines consequences of your actions not actions themselves.
                        yathatathyato artham - fulfiller of desires
                            souls can have infinite longings or longing for the infinite.
                            soul wants to go to hell - Lord allows that - hellish enjoyments then no interference.
                                actions are expressing the desires.
                            SP uses Lord repeatedly cuz greatness aspect and impersonal aspects are focus in upanishads.
                        Paribhuh - supreme
                        Svayambhuh - self sufficient
                        shuddhram - antiseptic and apapa-viddham - prophylactic.
                            prabhupada's translation is very interesting - preventive and curative.
                                what's the disease - material contamination - bhav rog - soul's attachment to body and bodily desires.
                                Morning Program - rituals and sadhana - purified of past and safeguard for upcomings also.
                            How lust will go away by hearing rasa-lila (10.33.39)
                                it's phala shruti and prayer mood is included.
                                privacy in night - suspicious thoughts and not holy thoughts come.
                            Why sannyasis glorify it
                                something special is going here that renunciates are glorifying.
                                temporary is destroyed - they give up the reflection but not reality.
                                material entanglements freedom comes to them.

                    Those in ignorance go to darkness and knowledge go to greater darkness.
                        Avidya - Ignorant pursuit of SG.
                        Vidya - Knowledge for pursuing SG.
                    there are differences in results and wise understand this.
                        Avidya - Knowledge for pursuit of SG
                        Vidya - Knowledge for pursuit of KC.
                    both cultivated together then liberation attained.
                        Avidya - Knowledge for bodily maintenance (material life) - ?maya indulgence vs maya study as abouts.
                        Vidya - Knowledge for pursuit of KC.
                    proof that scriptural text are not enought - there is text, there is context whole picture should be clear.

                        Avidyam upasate
                        vidyayam ratah - Irreligious, religious materialist, monist.
                    Lecture - Topic - 3 kinds of so called knowledge.
                        Why vidya < avidya?
                            Considerable growth in mass communication - credit where is due but many go beyond that - at expense of spiritual.
                            So many things have grown - but mental health - stress, depression, can't quantify happiness - suicide, addictions have increased.
                            physical comforts but miserable mentally. Sweat in field vs AC sweat cuz of tension.
                            material side excessive emphasized at expense of spirituality neglect - martin luther - guided missiles, misguided men.
                        Avidyam upasate
                            Forgetfulness of ishavasya principle is avidya.
                                Rejection of God=> Enjoying mentality (immediate result) - what other purpose than kama - lust or SG or enjoying mentality.
                                SUP BG - kama after rejection.
                            The profitless pursuit of sense gratification is the worship of avidya.
                                Images of actors in place of image of gods complaining - nothing against actors but abuse of power to be like God.
                                Desire at time of death - that's what we would desire.
                        vidyayam ratah
                            Irreligious (Gross or godless) Materialists - godless modern education
                                To be in ignorance is bad.
                                To be in ignorance and claim to be in knowledge is worse - non-theistic scientist.
                                To be in ignorance and claim to be in knowledge and to condemn real knowledge as ignorance is worst - atheistic scientist.
                                @Traffic laws - not know, vs Don't know but claim I know, vs misguiding those who are on the path and criticizing them.
                                Creation leads us to God - mechanism is not by chance - the beauty. Try to improve the world and no need of god.
                                    Like others, there are right wing atheists also - criticize god at all opportunity. Fanatical - misguiding people.
                                Tech not bad but what's it used for?
                                    Internet - knowledge cultivation vs SG desires and degradation. Did it help or not.
                                        Obscene content - psychological damaging for children.
                                    Underlying ethos of current times is avidyam upasate - SG is goal of life - material knowledge is meant to propose SG thru tech.
                                    Telecom study - better idiot box for ppl I wanna make - what am I doing?
                            Religious Materialists - veda vada ratah
                                BG 2.42-43, 9.20-21 - Karma Kandis
                                Mistake side issue in Vedas as their ultimate purpose.
                                Misguide people, misinterpret Vedas - tato bhuya iva te tamoh.
                                Most religions today think of religion as this - religion is materialism with pious face on it. No conception of spiritual.
                                    heavens still gotta fall down.
                                    Eg - Pious materialist - visa Ganesh temple
                                    Eg - Jihadis in Islam - misinterpreted verse - die in jihad then 71 virgins for eternity - gross misinterpretation.
                                        Attracted not to god but to virgins.
                                    Material knowledge of Vedas and not need for spiritual - depriving of higher purpose.
                                Story - Brahmins who neglected Krishna.
                            Monist - mayayapahrita jnanah
                                have knowledge but takes them deeper into darkness.
                                Brahmavadis - don't know about Bhagavan (12.4-5)
                                    difficult advancement - kleshas is extremely high - process and destination - think of sth impersonalist without higher taste.
                                Mayavadis - Imagine Bhagavan to be a temporary manifesetation of brahman (9.11-12)
                                    maya is ultimate reality - God's form is also maya.
                                    Go beyond bhagavan - brahman is reality - don't know transcendental nature - eth ruined cuz defy Krishna.
                                    can't we just tolerate - it's not just another philosophy - total disastrous misunderstanding of Vedas.
                                        Personal nature of God only in Vedas - very limited in other places.
                                        unique boon is made into unique bane
                                Sanatan dharma - God's personal descent - unique boon made into unique bane by imposters.
                                    @Counterfeit as real note is materialism - temporary mat acts are essence of life.
                                        monism mistakes real note as counterfeit - eternal spiritual acts are illusory.
                                        gotta go beyond lord's acts, form, etc.
                                        Why Krishna is black - intellectual titilling - in TOI spiritual column
                                            7 said black isn't beautiful - black indicates darkness and to light - go beyond dark from to white light.
                                            Shyam sundar - beautiful conventions may be Krishna not fit in.
                                    I also become worshippable at brahman platform - demigods form of brahman worship them or if can't see them then me.
                                    gotta get rid of mayavad thinking - in order to get higher understanding of bhagavan. So biggest obstacle.
                                Vada means argument world - school of system of thought.

                                    fallen and good for nothing - maybe self-centeredness; give respect without looking for.
                                    not thinking low of oneself but less about oneself.
                                not expecting respect - pretension for knowledge.
                                ahimsa - not source of anxiety for others.

                                means to find spiritual identity - BODD solution - many specific problems. General probs by raising consciousness.
                                avoid congested places where non-devs congregate - there collective presence creates a mass materialistic psychology and can be draining.
                                science wars - science vs philosophy - what makes human beings vs tech for faster progress. Arts vs science.
                                    physics or metaphysics all helps us with growth.

                                    envisioned tech will change the world.
                                    make things happen acc to my will. Click of button to email somewhere - tech power - good but can't reduce knowledge to it.
                                    more power with bad qualities can do harm.
                                    Divorse of education from transformation leads to disruption.
                                        Knowledge is not for pooling but pulling (towards Krishna)
                                        what you know ain't as important as how you live.
                                        education etymology - transformation. US guns and shoot others. So no contribution properly.
                                        Students toppers but fall prey to bad habits - smoking, drinking, illicit sex, etc.
                                            Campus less focus on value education.
                                        Irrelevant information rewarded 
                                            quiz shows - daughters of 1 actor - don't disrepect but irrelevant and adds no value. Win awards for it.
                                        SP to Harrison - actual SM - who is addicted to Krishna - addiction has helplessness - negative connotation generally but irrestable attraction to Krishna.
                                        Kind to animals - ethical treatment for samll leash and breakfast as flesh - mismatch of standards - divorse of learning and living.
                                        Euclidian Geometry - What's practical use - Knowledge is not just for earning.
                        Avidya leads to undesirable qualities
                            Students - no amanitvam, no shaucam
                                caricature of teachers, talk behind back and make fun - satirical joke.
                                finding faults in kaliyug is as clever as finding water in ocean. Finding land is powerful.
                                most creative ways to speak destructively is thought of as smart. Perverse standards - unfortunate standard.
                                illicit sex and no cleanliness. Self mastery few decades before so separate education - when have sex? whenever you wanna be weaker than yourself - energy sucked away.
                                Abortion, Teen pregnancy, suicides, STD, heart breaks, love triangles, etc.
                            Students grow up to be:
                                Scientist - no ahimsa - weapons of mass destructions. 
                                    Can kill life so many times over. Cockroaches will live.
                                    Tragic misuse of god given intelligence - WW2 - many resigned; can't use intel to kill fellow human beings - other picked up.
                                    one does other has to pick it up. Intel but misused. Eistein but paper lead to Manhattan project to atom bomb.
                                    Sending that letter was biggest mistake of my life. Wanted to make b4 hitler but Hitler wasn't close. Misappropriated title Aryan so some Vedic knowledge.
                                    Best insight of Best mind - E = mc^2 led to the worst destruction of last century in human memory.
                                    Scientists may say only developing tech - yes but falls to wrong hands and mass destruction.
                                    Underlying misdirected purpose of life.
                                Pseudo-religionists - no adambhitvam
                                    religions is to show off. People can see how religious I am - political correct.
                                    These days it is politically incorrect these days so have stopped that.
                                    Ganesh festival - size of image becomes expression of pride. Film songs go on - no genuine religious culture or understanding - appearance without substance.
                                    Mercy of guru is causeless - drop of charamrit falls on you - that person is initiated - something for no cost - no regulated principles, commitment and rules
                                    mutually self serving and self deluding arrangement. I have guru and I have so many followers.
                                Nationalists
                                    sensitive - understand mood properly.
                                    small planets - live for decades and divide earth to countries and make boundaries and keep shifting.
                                    social point of view very serious - land doesn't belong and we leave after tenure - trans perspective not very intelligent.
                                    Connotations - patriotism good connotation. Nationalist - My nation is best. Negative. SP uses latter.
                                    I am born here so it is special. Apara dharma isn't condemned - real vidya should raise us beyond this.
                                    SUP SB - list of acts good but if not spiritual advancement then go khara. Even religious things. Core focus on substance - SB is special.
                                        holy places also has cows and donkeys who take bath - how are we different.
                                    Not pinch or inflate false ego - pat it along trans - understand and share with world. Share spiritual legacy with others.
                                        Not nationalist sentiments - punya bhumi - many credits - spiritual substance flows thru our bodies - practice and share spirituality.
                                        Bring out that spirituality is focus on LCM.
                        Only a dhira can teach vidya
                            Not disturbed by material illusion.
                            No sojhati na kankshati
                            By chance got human life - but nth by chance - kind of culture exposed to; psychology created so next body - no intrinsic connection.
                                underlying principles but body and mind keep happening by nature's arrangements.
                                body is bad bargain - make best use of bad bargain.
                                body limits us physically and psychologically - body, mind tired, distracted.
                            Take help from Dhiras
                                self centered or obsessed - can't really think good of others - politicians can't act as dhira. Spiritual teachers have it - whole focus.

                    Meaning - Vidya and avidya together grant immortality.
                        knowledge for bodily maintenance and pursuit of KC.
                        @need to know boat and also the land I have to reach.
                            can't even live in world without former. live fruitfully with fulfilling the purpose.
                            navigating the boat of life - transcend probs for godhead is the goal not navigating boat for sake of it.
                    Lecture -Integrate Spiritual and Material knowledge while living in the world
                    Section Flow
                        Immortality is impossible materially
                            Demons
                                Eg - Hiranyakashipu - such penance no1 can imagine but all gone.
                                Eg - Ravan - descrating women and defile them. Decided to kill Narad - arrows disappeared.
                                    strategy of demons - can't defeat then befriend him - why could not - cuz I have spiritual body.
                                    How? Chant names of god - done with it, get lost.
                            Mystic power and science is similar - power from higher beings vs not ACK - power of nature and catch that power for oneself so similar in that control the nature.
                                flying yogis vs flying airplanes.
                                don't believe and no access so all effort in scientific power.
                            immortality thru science 
                                6 changes in matter are unstoppable and even incomprehensible.
                                ensouled matter grows, reproduces and preserves itself, whereas ordinary matter doesn't.
                                    living matter is oxymoron - chaste prostitute, courageous coward. 
                                    Our body has more phases to existence than just dead matter.
                                    tools - carpenter - fits so male parts and female parts nomenclature - but not produce other parts.
                                    preserves itself - cable doesn't but cut a hand and clot happens.
                                we know hows and whys - purpose? why 1 matter behaves one way and other differently.
                                    no comprehension.
                                    stop aging claims or becoming young - not possible cuz we can't control body - number of cells reproducing > dying so aging.
                                    finding genetics - not able to. No tech, therapy - that's official claim - can't even slow.
                                    we can do cosmetic but not inner health of body.
                                    Material world quietly makes one old - SP morning walk - I don't wanna bow down - forget Krishna;
                                        material nature makes you bow - no! - growing old - that's biology - that means biological force 
                                        so forced to submit to higher principle against your will.
                                    Computer of different size - manipulating nature within range - we don't change nature of nature but change the way we process nature.
                            where does urge for immortality come from - biological creature doomed fate - why would we desire something thta's impossible.
                                we urge for water - thirst - we have water; hunger - food, cold - warmth.
                                longing is so deep rooted - where it comes from. Fly expertly evades - cuz they love life and find ways to evade it.
                                where does urge come from - scripture - comes from atma. Can't know the nature of immortality thru logical inference - only detect its presence.
                                so scriptures tell atma belongs in spiritual world - eternity is possible over there.
                            Darwin got some things right - struggle for existence - 1 sentence response of SP - even fittest don't survive.
                                Lord has delivered scriptures in India and other scriptures in other countries to help.
                                don't wanna die but forced to so incompatible like marriages - vedas don't encourage divorce in marriage but spirit in matter.
                                there is process of disentanglement not 1 moment process.
                                Aliens are already there no fascinations and descriptions match with shastra - we are aliens in material world.
                        Immortality possible only by following Krishna's teachings.
                            experience + education makes learning complete - without education, experience goes worthless. Like overeating told by doctor. Pain but nth to do.
                                Yudhisthir M - e1 in past has died but we still hope for exception. How amazing!
                                misery and shastras say so increase faith in shastra - not stay miserable but identify the nature.
                                HEA - Happily ever after is exact opposite to dukhalayam ashashvatam.
                                @Lollypop idea of spirituality that it can make my happy in material world.
                            Body is a bad bargain
                                DIVE - Duration Intensity Variety, Extent.
                                Duration of enjoyment is very small - sex few mins (fascination for whole youth), toothache.
                                    BODD is far more pain
                                Intensity - body is sensitive far more for pain.
                                    sensual version of paradise - 1 prick and all gone.
                                    sweet rice in every mm of mouth - tongue caught in teeth and pain.
                                Variety - number of ways pleasure can be given is fewer than ways of pain.
                                    eyes - anything small goes wrong - beautiful object, insect, germs, degeneration, hit.
                                    teeth - crush for taste but breaking and full dept on dentology.
                                    skin - soft object; cold freeze, disease, etc.
                                Extent - Parts that give no grats but pain.
                                    eg - liver, kidney, etc.
                            Best use of bad bargain - DAKM for material harmony with spiritual.
                                yajna gives rain no belief - at least destroy ecology then nature goes against.
                                climate change is euphemism - it is disastrous.
                                DAKM is also a regulated approach. DAK is KK approach.
                        Krishna comes to make us immortal.
                        SG binds us to mortality; so restrict it
                            stomach upset and eat feast then more problem so less SG suggested.
                        Apara dharma balances mat and sp
                            worst use of bad bargain
                                obsessed only with artha and kama - sp degradation and mat devastation.
                                dharma is guide for it - else for artha thievery so mat devastation.
                            SP on VA but it's social arrangement. Contribute to well being of society.
                            if unsteady material life then anxiety and spirituality not possible at all.
                        Para dharma grants immortality.
                            Pure love for God - if conflict choose this.
                            This alone can satisfy the heart. Ketava dharma can't - anything short of para dharma.
                            Glory of Bhakti
                                Karma - abuse senses for material purpose - natural but binding.
                                Jnana - Reject senses for either mat or sp purpose - non-binding but unnatural.
                                Bhakti - center of pendulum - use material senses for sp purpose - natural and liberating.
                                    retains virtues of both of them and removes the probs with either.

                    Lecture - How demigod worship harmonizes with Krishna worship.
                    Overview
                        Even demigods and rishis misunderstand the AT to be impersonal.
                            Krishna is not easy to get - BG even rishis don't know me.
                            Even vedic scriptures it is reiterated that no1 understands AT.
                            But they approach AT but think that beyond Vishnu there's some light.
                            Brahma first time heart thought Karma, next time Jnana and Bhakti the 3rd time. #Joke - did he not try the next time.
                        Demigod worshipers stay in the dark material world.
                            not degraded but stay in ignorant spiritual truth.
                            good is the worst enemy of the best - it is not bad - it's pious but good declared as best is worse.
                            purpose is gradual elevation - alternatives given to jivas.
                            @Prodigal son story - God's love is far more than this.
                                God's love is much deeper than that.

                                    Some other Land Lord - Semi-god (say me god) - Wealth - Materialism
                                    Minister of king - demigod - wealth - KK. 
                                        I will pay you why not work for me - doesn't know he works under father - better material facilities
                                        change in jurisdiction you come under. Selfish motives but under Krishna's extended realm. House of vedas - safer.
                                        demigod worship is better than abrahamic cuz in house of vedas - of course, average case analysis. PD in other religions is separate case.
                                    King - Krishna - wealth - Sakama bhakti.
                                        why employee - you stay with me - no, pay me more. Really kind hearted person.
                                        going back to serving ministers of king is undesirable (later)
                                    King - Krishna - Love - shuddha bhakti.
                            Why polytheism - no, multi-level worship and that bears testimony to:
                                unique concern for the individuality of the worshipper.
                                an unparalleled flexibility of the worshippable in making himself accessible.
                                    no problem you can approach my representative.
                            Good or bad - depends on the level of the practitioner.
                                student scores 60% - good or bad? - depends on what he is capable of scoring - 40? excellent. 80? undesirable (shabash vs badmash)
                                for atheists and materialists - it is recommended.
                                for serious spiritual seekers - discouraged.
                                Demigod worship elevation eg
                                    Vallabhacharya - devotee of vishnu and shiva - fervent prayers - shiva appeared - give dearest to you - bright smile gave Krishna deity.
                                    Keshav Kashmiri - sign of defeating - nimai pandit flummoxed - not humiliate; go read books and come back we will discuss tomorrow - why forsake me?
                                        my blessing that no1 could defeat in world - person you encountered is not from this world; Krishna. My greatest blessing is not worship champ scholar but shelter of Krishna.
                                    Chandi das - prosperity and brother had vishnu deity - gimme? no ; mental offering - chandi appeared - you gave me prasad of lord so pleased. is it better - of course -
                                        my master is shiva and shiva's master is vishnu; master of my master - why not told me - you never asked; always gimme this and that. 
                                        Became PD but Kept the name cuz considered chandi as guru. Beautiful poetry.
                                May even take demigods as supreme and may not elevate.
                                    becomes ultimate target and not the means - not progression but misdirection.
                                    This is high probability of happening. Taking your object of worship as supreme.
                                    BG 7.20 - knowledge abducted by material desires. Then why facilitated - love that his nature will attract him to that minister so supersoul also gives faith.
                                        turn indirectly to him thru them. Minister still get power and emoluments from king and can give in turn to subjects.
                                        18 puranas - in different modes - let them get attracted to respective deities. Let it go on, then?
                                        less intelligent - that same TME directed to Krishna could give highest reward.
                                        although system created by him but not the same as him - consciousness has to rise.
                                    may get stuck in KK cycle and not come out and bad association ? can decline also.
                        Impersonalists who mislead people go the darkest regions of hell.

                    Lecture - How to understand and deal with impersonalists - Brahmavadis and Mayavadis.
                        Types of impersonalists - 
                            Mayavadis - BG 7.24, 9.14-15 - offence to form of God.
                                avajananti maam mudha.
                            Brahmavadis BG 12.3-5 - No offence to the form of God. 
                                Just not attracted to that form cuz of no association.
                        Impersonalism in scriptures is transitional not final
                            Vedas - KK, Religious matrialism
                                slowly to MOG.
                            Upanishads - Jnana Kanda - Impersonalism while going from mat to sp form.
                                transitional may sound imperonalist but a stepping stone - but not always.
                            Bhagavatam - Bhakti - Sp form.
                        History of Mayavad
                            Intro - Vyavaharika and paramarthik reality.
                                scriptures talk about relationship, reciprocation - person, devotion.
                                they consider this as lower level teachings - vedas mostly vyavaharika and sometimes paramarthik.
                                mahavakya in vedas and laghu vakya are others. tat tvam asi, aham brahmasmi are mahavakya.
                                very self serving system of reasoning - anything contradictory is relegated to low level reality.
                            Medieval spread of Mayavad
                                Stepping stone in Vedic Masterplan
                                    abused KK reset by buddha - reject vedas if you don't respect life - don't bother about god practice morality.
                                    Buddhism isn't atheistic but non-theistic - doesn't talk about God - sometimes args that seem to disprove God but rare.
                                    metaphysics without scripture is speculative philosophy which Buddha disapproved. So, focus was - don't bother about it.
                                        so that way not even non-theistic - it was pre-theistic - platform for theism in future properly.
                                        taking people to zero from negative but not positive cuz vedas rejected.
                                    Brahmins also superiority over other castes thereby alienating them. So no caste discrimination attracted them - thus buddhism took over.
                                        over period of time to establish autonomy - being different from vedic tradition - wrote explicit criticism of vedas.
                                        temporary emergency program to stop indiscriminate slaughter became permanent wholesale program against vedas.
                                    Reinstate thru shankaracharya - shunya conception of Buddhism is vedic brahma (only nomenclature difference otherwise clones)
                                        his purpose was historical - back people into vedic fold and scriptural - mayavad.
                                        shankar to parvati on vishnu's request - I confuse kali people with asat shastra or mayavad.
                                        shankar acharya also talk about 0 but in vedic fold - defy god and claim to be religious - AT is formless I am god.
                                        boost false ego with being "God" - that's not conclusion of brahmavad - it is world is temporary and liberate from the realm.
                                        go beyond temporary - what's the target is not much talked. Only amal puran SB talks about it.
                                    Movie should be seen in conclusion - hero wins against villain - taking one scene and making claims based on that isn't right.
                                        Lord's plan spanning over centuries.
                                        his hold on society was stronger than science in modern times so ramanuja didn't do face off.
                                    ramanujacharya - eth is 1 but difference also. Vishishta advaita.
                                    madhvacharya - Jiva Jagat Jagadish - all different. There is bheda.
                                        with 2 levels of reality we are superimposing our philosophy on scripture and saying what we wanna say.
                                    LCM - brings in balance once more - acintya bhed abhed tattva.
                                        duality in oneness which is full of ecstasy.
                                    Progressive evolution of theistic revelation.
                                    SP - hammers simple points of logic fatal for mayavad.
                                        brahma satya jagat mithya - where illusion comes from.
                                        how illusion overcomes brahman. reality also seen as maya.
                                            anirvachaniya - reality so complex that we can't understand.
                                        Ravindra Prabhu to challenge mayavadis - 
                                            Buddha divine, Jesus sacrifice divine. Krishna love divine, you become supreme divine.
                                            paled expression on asking Krishna killed putana when < 1 month old so when chance to become god.
                                            words illusion - I was listening to you for 2 hrs they weren't illusion then.
                                        If you and I are 1 then when you get liberated I also get liberated.
                                            You are also liberated but you don't realize it - why - illusion - so illusion controls me - 
                                                no, you only thinking that illusion is controlling you - so illusion of thinking is controlling me => illusion is above brahman!!
                                    Achintya vs Anirvacaniya - scriptures read by both and they encounter -
                                        Apparent spiritual contradictions
                                            Everything is true (calling scripture as false is violence to it)
                                                we can't understand how simultaneously - acintya.
                                                acintya is glory of scriptures that inconceivable chracteristics.
                                            Divided into True False
                                                Logical problems - anirvacaniya.
                                                Ineffeable is to escape to do away with logical arguments.
                                Where impersonalists are right - where they go wrong.
                                    material form and variety is false (illuion rather illusory) that's right
                                    but rejecting form is ultimate truth.
                                    @unlimited AT - room has form and is limited - destroy it and heap debris - it's still limited.
                                        removing form is not enough to result of removing form. It is result of removing matter but spirit is unlimited.
                                        Krishan showing universe in the mouth of yashoda mayi - form may seem limited but demonstration that it is not.
                                Mat forms and varieties -> Material Desires -> Material Miseries.
                                    transitional seen as final - that becomes fatal and lethal.
                            Modern boost and twist to Mayavad
                                mayavad is deviant teaching cuz transitional is presented as conclusion.
                                    but perverted, distorted and poisioned cuz of envy to Krishna.
                                    mayavad became weak after vaishnavas face off with mayavad.
                                    weak kshatriyas and corrupted brahmanas - overall social economic health was poor - philosophically speaking.
                                    economic poverty - mainly agriculture based so not perpetual. Britishers came to India not cuz it was poor country but wealthy country.
                                    smarta brahmana - rituals without substance was the state - conversion to christianity - not much philosophy - mainly moral teachings.
                                    mainly attracting people - challenging hindus - hindu word didn't exist popularised by britishers and muslims - confused so many gods.
                                    christians used social service so social service incorporated into modern hindusim by bengali spiritual teachers.
                                    slogans originated like - manav seva madhav seva; daridra narayan.
                                        Serving poor is part of vedic culture - done by kshatriyas eg prithu M - can be devotional service in proper consciousness but apara dharma for sure.
                                        no need of temples but serve poors - as substitute is wrong. This minimizes the importance of DS.
                                        no need for tulsi; brinjal gets you sth to eat; replace BG by football and meat - attacks on DS.
                                        humanitarian welfare is good but not goal of life.
                                    here mayavad attempted to not just equate brahman in temple to brahman in poor but aggrandized the former over the latter.
                                        social service superior to DS. This is attack on foundations of Vedic devotional culture.
                                        golden shackles - strong stands by our acharyas.
                                    Nationalism influence - India religion is united but also divided different objects of worship.
                                        best is make 1 as reality and all gods are representations of reality.
                                        In this process, spiritual aspect as conclusion is put aside.
                                        BG conclusion is not politically convenient - so acharyas responded strongly.
                                        materially good but made to seem spiritual and purpose is lost.
                                        mayavad avoids surrender - you are god.
                                    Today's mayavad is trivialized - I am not here to tell you I am god but you are god.
                                        feel good nothingness is very famous.
                                Dangerous hodgepodge khichadi of 4 things
                                    Grains of impersonalism drawn from upanishads
                                    sugar of social service taken from christianity
                                    spice of nationalism taken from the Indian Independence movement.
                                    envy of Krishna from the hearts of the conditioned souls.
                            Disasters caused by Mayavad
                                Deprives soul of his natural higher taste of bhakti.
                                    their contributions to national or social service level can be ACK but at expense of DS is serious misleading.
                                Makes material life appear more attractive than spiritual life.
                                    abstract reality - think religious - high claims but no higher taste - so attraction to lower taste and spiritual reality so tasteless.
                                    peace and shanti for all of eternity - no taste cuz nth to taste, smell, see, etc.
                                    Merge in brahman and exist that's all - not an appealing proposal.
                                    Motion causing pain so don't move - goal is not pain-free but be happy. Go beyond from pain - nth there so come back.
                                    So, Paradox in India - very religious but no taste so very materialistic also.
                            Cigrette by Sadhu - all in mind good and bad - death is painful for e1 - attachment not removed by imaging oneself as god.

                                AT is unlimited but still can be accessed by taking consciousness in particular direction.
                                The thrust is not AT is stations - path to AT anything works or evolving consciousness.
                                    Transcendental reality needs evolution not lower MMN - not all MMN can perceive AT.
                                    To go close to person we need to change likes dislikes in ordinary persons favors 
                                    AT is also person so approach as person. His likes are not arbitrary btw.
                                SP - does BG say If whatever we do takes us to godhead - if so, why it has to be spoken.

                                    people attracted to different things in material world - spark of Krishna's spendor so on my path.
                                    beauty may be temporary but attracts, alcohol does take away although attractive to some or talent of person - that attractiveness is coming from Krishna.
                                    so the sparks should not distract but attract to the whole.
                            Origin - simplistic wish to oversimplify things 
                                teacher should simplify things and not present as complex as they are but a limit to it.
                            More Origin - Why deny it?
                                3 broad paths
                                    exclusivism - My way is the only right way.

                                        this reduction of god to monopolised commodity in religious marketplace alienates people.
                                        most abrahamic religions - sounds narrow minded - christinity, judaism, islam.
                                    Other extreme - pluralism - all ways are right.
                                        all paths are right. Multi-cultures in all countries.
                                        christianity and paganism - atheist. To avoid conflicts - your path is right; my path is right.
                                        every human has their religion - open minded and broad - not so much that brains fall out.
                                        Tolerate should not quote impotence. Going back to god is theistic teachings.
                                        if all are right, atheism is right then religions are wrong so logically contradiction.
                                        @Diseased then different treatments (allopathy, ayurveda, naturopathy, homeo) - not what I like but what makes a person healthy.
                                            reports come out well - objective criteria for health.
                                            SP would say that objective criteria that developing love for God. Jesus is guru that love for god to lay down his life.
                                        famous ethos of yato mat tato path but not shastic.
                                    Balanced state - Inclusivism - there is one way with various levels.
                                        different lanes of religions - we not here to convert but make people lovers of god - lovers of materialism to god.
                                        objectivity to that criteria then equate sickness with health.
                                        communal harmony doesn't come by whitewashing all the paths. Different paths different consequences.
                                Eg - Host asked christianity - preist asked about SP silent and SP broad yes bible godhead but preist no narrow road.
                                    affiliation to instituion doesn't but take to god but purification of heart - of course, orgs can help.
                                SP - 
                                    nominal christian then LCM and yuga dharma so swift and effective treatment.
                                    staunch or strict - then not convert but raise their standards like meat eating and all SP would do.
                                @Breaking other hospitals so that patients come to our hospital.
                                    that's not our goal. Some hospitals may have better facilities. But no monopoly of institutions.
                                impersonalism also evolve on their paths but based on consequence need to see if offenders then bad.
                                    SP cordial with Mishraji on impersonal talks so need to understand.
                                    Fools and rascals in conversations -
                                        to make point what's right and wrong - purports very less.
                                        transcribe letters - prayas so avoid - purports have everything.
                                        Jayadvaita swami - levels of authority - Purports (universal), letters (person context), lectural (place specifc), conversations (group context)
                                        fool and rascals - purity of purpose - 
                                            not arrogance but compassion way - Lord please help them.
                                            we use is not compassion but judgmental and condemnatory way.
                                            we are driving people away from Krishna - don't disturb people who are attached - engage them accorgingly is what Krishna says.
                                        convinced mayavadis vs auxillary sources mayavadis - most in Indian are impersonalists. So don't equate them, rather help them.
                                            not philosophically committed to mayavad but emotional attachments - attraction for leaders not cuz teachings but heard good about them from different sources.
                                            that swamis books I have read - he is fool and rascal - shockers for many - you are sadhu how can you say.
                                            yat gatva na nivartante - not come close to Krishna again.
                                            good that you have spiritual inclinations - very few have. read books and programs you will get systematic understandings.
                                        what do you think about that person they ask? - SP has taught us the way.
                                            ask what is his philosophy - most often people say I don't know.
                                            BG teaches and all accept it so study it.
                                            to whatever teacher they have emotional attachment can't call it faith - KC is another mountain top - we need to bridge them.
                                            our conduct should not alienate but bridge them to KC. Don't break bridge for those who are walking on it.
                                        Eg - personal - friend with spiritual inclination - intellectual leader Prji was - shocked on hearing that that orgs swami won't get place even in hell.
                                            driven away cuz not sensitiely handled - became sanyasi in mayavad school - of course, no celibate phase there.
                                            Instead of principles taken to Krishna - took him away deeper into mayavad.
                                            when names and persons come up it is not philosophy but emotions that come up. You hurt them - emotional filters are closed - not open to rational discussions.
                                            our goal is open rational filters thru open emotional filters - ourselves be convinced of siddhant, of course.
                                            philosophically mayavad is wrong but culturally it is good. They develop sympathy for vedic culture.
                                            it is by far not the best but as dev, be able to see good in others - carefully bring people to Krishna's feet.
                                            My devs are perfect gentlemen and ladies.
                                        Goal is not just strong preaching - test of strong preaching is not strength of words but transformation of heart that it brings.
                                            strong transformation - more often, not by strong speech but by sensitive respectful speech, accompanied by careful explanation, cultural behavior and love & care.
                                            Goal is to bring people to Krishna not drive them away.
                                            G Harrison used many spiritual teachers - SP gave no comments - said let him come and associate with devs without judgments and he evolved (became devotee).
                                            SP was warrior - which instrument works best for specific case.
                        Dhira teaches shastra : different paths lead to different goals
                        Accept Krishna as sambhavat?
                            Yes? Arjuna. Kills so called relatives to satisfy Krishna.
                            No? People are my god or I am god.

                    Lecture - How Krishna consciousness and service to humanity concur and differ
                    social, philosophical, analytical exploration.
                    Overview
                        General - talks about it and popular idea - serve poor in place of stone in temple.
                            they should be fed, no doubt. Is money spent inside is the cause of starvation outside?
                            at superficial level, the money that's spent here could be spent there
                            but beggars ain't starving only outside the temples. They starve in slums, street everywhere, billionaire's houses as well (but guard drive them away).
                            this is emotional manipulation to contrast beggars outside temple with temple. Why not contrast them with billions spent on cricket, movies, etc frivolous entertainments.
                                we have nothing against sports or movies per se. Of course, they are mundane and passionate and distracting.
                                1 event worth millions of Rs - how many poor could be fed with that money. #At least developing infrastructure for them.
                            If US and EU perfume investments diverted towards poor then no starvation in world.
                                for sake of my smelling good, others have to starve.
                                Such contrasts are very uncomfortable for us cuz messes with our SG.
                                putting blame on them makes us feel superior to temple worshippers and exempts us from responsibility of going to temple worshipping and / or take care of poor.
                            The goal is not to justify people's starvation - it is duty of prosperous to feed the poor 
                                but to manipulate the emotions in this way against god is misleading.
                                not only misleading but doesn't solve the problem at all.
                        Let the facts speak (old facts - figures may change but underlying thread remains the same)
                            UNICEF - To satisfy the world's sanitation and food requirements would cost only US $13 billion - what the people of the US and EU spend on perfume each year.
                                When identify with body, decorate it. with mind, titillate the mind (movies, sports, etc) and millions spent there.
                                with id with soul then no id so much with body and mind and needed to spend so much on these wants.
                                So, misleading propaganda to say the very least.
                            With God consciousness, you see all jivas as children of god.
                                Why see god in temple and not beggars all around - why don't we see god in slaughterhouses where animals are being killed.
                                true god consciousness will reflect in diet - nonveg will become veg => land used to grow fodder for animals could be used to get grains for beggars.
                                    so much fodder yielding little bit of flesh and most of it is passed out - so flesh eaten was very lossy use of fields from diet perspective.
                                    amount of land used to feed 1 plate of nonveg could feed so many veg plates (1:5..50)
                                    If you really care for beggars, first thing to do is to become vegetarian.
                                    several more times world's population could be fed if land was used properly.
                                Similarly, people drink - enjoy life; others are primitive.
                                    ever wonders, their "cheers" could be the cause of "tears" in eyes of starving people.
                                    alcohol doesn't pop from air - it comes from sugarcane which in turn comes from fields.
                                    so many sugarcanes all over the world used to make alcohol. That land could be used for grains.
                                    If people drinking alcohol so much land could be saved for grains.
                                With God consciousness, people naturally stop consuming meat and alcohol - thereby contributing to land saved for grains.
                                    This solves the problem of starvation in much more deeper way, far reaching way
                                    rather than over simplistic way of saying temples replaced to feed the poor.
                                    pointing fingers for other solutions are not real solutions.
                            1.3 Billion - 1/4 of world population liv eon less than 1$ per day while billionaires have assets exceeding combined annual incomes of countries with 45% of world's people.
                                the problem is greed.
                                Much of the world's best land is being misued for production of cash export crops.
                                Study of famines in Africa showed that every occasion the affected nation had within its own boundaries the food resources to feed its starving citizens
                                    but relief was intentionally withheld due to economic or political motives.
                                Why are we discussing this today in Isho? worshipping 1 thing one result comes and another with the other.
                                    another object of worship today substituting god, at least in notions, is humanitarian work.
                                    The actual cause if not even mismanagement as discussed b4, at deeper level it is greed.
                                    this problem automatically solved if god conscious not so much self centered and would care for others.
                        Greed causes starvation
                            when people become godless, they concomitatntly become materialistic and greedy - and so exploid nature and their fellow humans for their selfish enjoyment.
                            Another perspective - We may feed a few hungry people but till we remove greed from wealthy people's hearts, hunger will continue to torment millions.
                            The problem is not 7 is hungry give them food - that will help but only little bit and for little time - far more fundamental solution is purify people's hearts of greed.
                            problem is not shortage of food but shortage of compassion. Excessive greed exists because people think that material things will make us happy so hoard more and more.
                        How can greed by removed
                            When people are offered spiritual education and experience, they understand that their real happiness is in loving God, not in accumulating material things. Then they give up greed.
                            HK Chanting and sharing - transforms us positively and others - tangible contribs in world also.
                            Conclusion - Transforming the heart of one greedy wealthy person is more effective to tackle starvation than merely feeding few hungry people.
                        The secret of compassion
                            When Mother Teresa asked - secret of compassion - pointed her rosary beads; by praying I feel love for God and all his children and so want to help them as much as I can.
                            Vision of spiritualist - sees god in all jivas - children of god.
                            spiritual advancement isn't doing good to yourself but to whole world - cuz removing greed from hearts of people.
                        Are good intentions good enough
                            many starving people also have bad habits - liquor; money misused.
                            I used to teach children subjects in slums with idea that literacy is key to good future.
                                a friend was more into this - children were more affected by culture; parents. Father drunkard; given up then elections and free liquor.
                                then realized just material literacy isn't enough - we gotta find some way to change people internally.
                                I have to do something that will affect people internally. Soon introduced to KC.
                                I became free from bad habits. My friends were much deeper and all got free from it.
                                bad habits just fell off and not that we had to struggle for it.
                            This our inability to control ourselves hurts people.
                                without this, even if you offer help to people who are not in position to be helped, will misuse the help.
                                offering help is like pouring water in leaking jug. No matter how much you pour, it leaks away.
                                If you give money to beggar, what do you think they would do with it?
                                    many a times, you offer them food and they deny to take it and ask for money instead.
                                    hunger thirst with little bit but more importantly smoking drinking for getting high.
                                    good intentions are good but are they good enough - did they produce the result desired.
                                If a person with a venereal disease is cured, what will he do afterwards?
                                    most likely will try to get the same disease once again.
                                If you offer free treatment to an alcoholic, do you know what he will do after being cured?
                                    he will indulge once again.
                                The road to hell is often paved with good intentions.
                                    Eg - SP - giving oily food to a typhoid patient.
                                Idea is not that all poor people have bad habits but only good intentions are not good enough.
                                    so just like we need a process to transform the greedy; we also need a process to transform the needy.
                                    needy may think their physical and psychological needs are more urgent and important than their spiritual needs.
                                        food, shelter, alcohol, etc.
                                Is social service to be condemned - not necessarily. 
                                    We don't need to replace people as false god as substitute of god.
                                    don't exalt it so much to think of it as superior to devotional service.
                                    Eg - Hippies was big problem in USA but SP transformed them - is it not humanitarian work.
                                    So, devs are not against social service but against supplanting it with DS.
                        "Simply envious"
                        Social service with yukta vairagya
                            About - Yukta vairagya means anything, that can be engaged in Krishna's service, should not be renounced. Of course, with precaution.
                            Attract people to Krishna through it.
                            Material welfare is not unimportant.
                                Not just a tool to attract people - also important for KC.
                                Eg - Prithu M. 
                                    Like Forest fire burns, our digestive fire is burning us.
                                    immediately took care of it not said oh it's your karma.
                            Division of labor in VA
                                Primarily Kshatriya responsibility to provide material welfare
                                Brahmana responsibility to provide spiritual welfare
                                SP wanted full varnashram.
                                    Looking for brahmanas - spiritually inclined humans who have love for knowledge and also sharing it.
                                    Full well being - material needs taken care of - institutions do that.
                                    If dev inspired to do humanitarian and integrate spirituality - it's wonderful
                                    Eg - like hospital, etc. Does anyone take initiation vow that I won't give donation to ne1 other than ISKCON.
                                    that's foolish - won't give donation to beggar. 
                                    Replacing God with people is strongly refuted and condemned but not to be insensitive to other humans.
                            BST to disciples outside Sakshi Gopal temple    
                                result of no humanitarian for poor - hard heart and greedy so won't do that for DS and offensive mentality.
                            The 2 ideas are complementary. Feel for others sufferings - soft heart can see outside of their own pains.
                                we feel for Krishna, feel like Krishna - not become but like Krishna - jivas suffering in separation.
                                help others by not just giving money but also spiritualizing charity.
                        Conclusion about Social Service - Don't exalt, don't denigrate. Utilize in KC.
                            karmic reactions and you get if you help them. Philosophically true but devotionally insensitive.
                            devotee is primarily concerned not with Karma but Krishna - how to move to Krishna and move others.
                            MOP materialist with self centered materialist - Humanitarians are MOG which are selfless think of society beyond self and family.
                            MOPG - compassion for soul - doesn't mean I would take care of soul and body is not my business. 
                            Eg - SP cleaned the plates of common people.
                            Some humanitarian workers are not just critical of religions but even are blasphemous 
                                God sends disasters, we send relief.
                                God doesn't send disasters, it is our karma which sends disasters.
                                These people become less receptive to DS than self centered materialists and can mislead people more.
                                material point of view humanitarians were higher but here in DS perspective, they became lower.
                                Such people are not many. 
                                Social work be subset of DS work.
                            Lokpal to punish guilty is important but transform the heart; change of heart by Gopal.
                                the powerful can still manage to escape - beyond jurisdiction - meta people can be flawed.
                                it may punishment but doesn't change the heart of people.
                            The best Manava Seva is to connect Manava to Madhava and to make Madhava accessible to Manava.

                                Their spiritual life begins by that. President came to temple so let me go see temple - God there but no1 came to see.

                        Temporary so not reject but utilize.
                        Study both permanent and temporary for transcendence.

                        Material world time scales but all are temporary.
                        six laws of transformations - both living and nonliving (only 3)
                            birth, growth, maintenance, reproduction, deterioration, death.
                        Time Models 
                            Linear time scale model - universe starts, life starts, evolution, life ends, universe ends.
                                Greek and Roman model was also cyclic like India.
                                Science adopted the christian idea of linear time scale.
                                Every self serving model that we are centers even sun around earth.
                            Cycle - Creation maintenance destruction and we can go out.
                                appears like no chance of progress - no room for improvement and seems pessimist - but spiritual progress not material.
                                Yes cycle of life but idea is to go out not stay stuck and lose growth mindset.
                                linear encourages growth mindset it seems.
                                Life of brahma (51st year going on; 36K Kalpas and equal nights; full devastation follows)
                                    kalpa (day of brahma then night - partial devastation - 7th now; 14 manvantaras and 15 Sandhyas)
                                    manvantara 71 divya yuga (sandhya separated for partial devastation) - 28th now, 
                                    divyayugas (4 yugas - sandhyas separation; kali now)
                                yuga sandhya - 36K yrs begin and 36K end - 360K Kali tenure.
                                Mahayuga is 10K. 1000 mahayugas is day of brahma including sandhya kaal.
                                1 ms of Brahma - life happens.
                            @car - 2hrs availability - go to destination else new one - else if time wasted in hotels then miss it.
                        Dev transcends death - sorrow about past, pain at present and fear about future.
                            @Cat holding kitten vs rat. Held by love or fear of death.
                            40K scorpion bites quantification impelled - depends on degree of attachment.
                                for dev - it's inconvenience but not troubled - like puncture of car is external to me - body like machine.
                                No emotions involved - pain exist but suffering not so much. Bumper of car is hit - my car or my sold out car.
                            Everything and e1 is taken away. Krishna's property for devs.
                            Future uncertainities - whether day of judgment or whatever. Welcoming to future cuz Krishna.
                                Eg - Sridhar Swami - Jolly Swami - Mayapur so focus on Krishna. Body patches - I will anyways leave body.
                                    1 way ticket to Mayapur - spiritual world is.
                                    bloated stomach and unconscious - is it boy or girl. ONGC can use my stomach.
                                    Mayapur wanted and was there - but left the festival center of attraction should be LCM not me.
                                    Not many devs depart gracefully but destination is important and consciousness.
                        SP transformed not just those who had renounced for spirituality but also hippies.
                            SP said 1 moon is better than 100 stars but Krishna gave me many moons.

                            Personal reality higher than impersonal brahman.
                        Overview
                            Pushann : Krishna is the basis of brahman and paramatma.
                            Satya Dharmaya Drishtaye - how Krishna reveals himself beyond the brahman.
                            How the ultimte revelation of bhagavan comes only by bhakti.
                        Detailed
                            Bhagavan is ultimate revelation of eth.
                                Sankhya - AT as matter.
                                    reality beyond appearances. Eth is 5 elements and 3 subtle elements - no love songs for them.
                                    Eg - Puri tasty but trace back - oil and floor no watering of mouth.
                                    Theistic and atheistic sankhya. Fundamental elements are the reality - conclusion is matter. Most scientists here.
                                Jnana - AT without or with only potencies - brahman and sat.
                                    matter changes but not spirit.
                                    AT is pure consciousness. We say it that no anartha contamination.
                                        Subject, stream, object for conscious perception.
                                        Subject and object are gone. Only abstract conceptualisation.
                                Yoga - AT with only mat potencies. sat and cit.
                                    not relished the taste of gulabjamun but a lot is known.
                                    Paramatma is potencies - supervising material world. Governing being is seen here.
                                    Overseer, permitter, bhokta of material world.
                                    power of indra - changing rain from a place to another. Paramatma is god of gods.
                                    the dual nature is visible here - subject of consciousness is spirit paramatma and not material.
                                Bhakti - AT with sp and mat potencies. sat cit and ananda.
                                    reciprocation aspect is added here not just passive contemplation.
                                    there is a joy in the reciprocation part.
                                    the dual nature of subject being god and object being soul also exists here but more interactive.
                                    hladini gives joy to Krishna and nourishes DS of devs.
                                    For love reciprocation the best - yogamaya makes forget godhood of Krishna - yoga maya is oxymoron - deepens yoga.
                                        Majestic then always bow down - even that's powerful with Krishna but spiritual activities in rasas are more joyful.
                                        illusion that helps serve Krishna.
                                @Gulabjamun - fragrance, sight, taste - different levels of perceptions.
                                @sun rays, planet and person.
                            Bhagavan is ultimate revelation - BG 7th chapter, 6th and 3rd.
                                Kelvin forced by science to believe in God. Magnificence of Lord. Earlier scientists had God consciousness but lately more independent - matter focussed.
                                7.19 Jnana-van surrenders unto me.
                                    Shukadev G, Kumaras.
                                        wealthy chases after something means sth attractive - atmaram but still perform bhakti.
                                        Nothing material in Krishna cuz they are not attracted to nothing material.
                                        exploring vaikuntha with unbiased mind.
                                Yoga - behold Paramatma in heart - yo maam pashyati sarvatra.
                                    such yogi is never lost so transition to bhakti.
                                karma - 3.9 and 3.30 - comes to bhakti.
                                yasya prabha prabhavato - Krishna is origin of that.
                            Darkness blinds but brightness also blinds thru glow 
                                tamaso ma jyotirgamay - but light so bright that blinded.
                                Spiritual reality is blinding - it's prayer to remove blindness caused by enlightenment.

                        Title - Prayers to AT culminate in DS.
                            Beseeching mercy - Supremely auspicious - I want to see that form.
                            Upanishads are impersonal but here they are explicit.
                            soham is 1 aspect but another should not be missed - achintya bhed abhed.
                        Overview
                            Vyuha rashmin - beyond brahman is bhagavan.
                            Kalyana tama - Bhagavan is most auspicious realization.
                            Pusann - How lord maintains the devs and e1 and eth else.
                            so'ham asmi - how the living entity is one yet different from the Lord.
                            The favor of the Lord sought by this prayer is fulfilled in PDS.
                        Detailed
                            Intro
                                brahman understanding form illusion is added then bhagavan.
                                bhagavan understanding is sat cit and ananda is added to make bhagavan.
                                shlokas supports latter - brahman's pratishtha aham.
                                consciousness without appeal then dry so they suggest bhakti for newcomers.
                            Bhagavan is kalyana tama
                                he is the highest and best destination.
                                    heart is completely satisfies and no coming back from sp world.
                                he helps devs by bestowing his grace.
                                    @7 pulls outta well is better than doing it ourselves and can fallback.
                                        rope is spiritual process and 
                                        bhagavan authority so ask for help but other yogas then efforts.
                                        but such people Krishna says is sudurlabha but he become sulabhah.
                            Knowledge is powerful - brings dimension of love and awareness.
                                taste is next level. Saying billionaire vs being billionaire.
                                material taste degrades to lower destinations.
                                when serve Krishna then taste comes - engagement gives taste but reciprocation far more.
                                Knowledge, grace and taste - all comes in bhagavan.
                                bha - bharta - maintainer, ga - gamyate, van - vaas roots who resides in (eth in his energies).
                                    eth in him, he in eth; devs hold nth back, nth holds dev back - figure of speech is kayasmas.
                            so'ham to daso'ham realization
                                oneness in quality may be emphasized at times but that doesn't deny difference in quantity.
                                so'ham is favorite word of brahmavadis.
                                attached to ego - then difficult. Soul price then daso'ham.
                                brilliant moment of eureka of enlightenment when so'ham with conviction.
                            DST (Durgama Sangamani Tika) : Jnana refers to spiritual reality and 3 aspects:
                                Atma-jnana
                                Ishvar-jnana
                                Aiktava-jnana
                            why jnana pratikul to bhakti? 3 aspects and their effects.
                                constitution (what's made of) - oneness denies eternality of bhakti.
                                    losing bhakti is greatest disaster so hell better than brahman.
                                application - hardening of heart.
                                    every single interaction so objective everywhere.
                                    sentiments dry up - insensitive application of DS - you are sick, that's maya - no!
                                destination - merging : end of bhakti.
                                    end of bhakti. no urge to merge.
                            Jnana can be anukul to bhakti also.
                                constitution - emphasized subordination of soul.
                                application - stabilization of bhakti practices.
                                destination - enhanced appreciation of lord's glories.
                            Prayers to PDS - 
                                Sky I love you!! - peace possible with contemplation on sky but no love 
                                but person is loved.
                                Chanting is a prayer and fulfillment of prayer - plz engage me in seva; krishna manifested as HN we are serving him.
                                Eg - I see light in my head - keep chanting and it will go away.
                                If miracles is the criteria then circus is spiritual world.
                                supernatural is not criteria although they may happen but opportunity of PDS.

                        Title:How DS prepares us for passing exam of death
                            let body and air merge - remember my sacrifices and all I did for you.
                            social cosmetics vs supreme importance at death.
                            what happens after death depends on how life was lived.
                            why tell that what I have done for you remember 
                                not PDS but seeing soberly about death is powerful should not be looked down upon.
                        Overview
                            Material body is a foreign dress that must be given up.
                            The best way to give up the body is by surrendering to the Lord - not by going to the brahmajyoti.
                            The importance of the last thought.
                            Krishna never forgets our service to him.
                            Krishna's mercy is ever-available thru DS.
                            SB elaborates this verse and all other verses.
                            Prepare for death by dev practice.
                        Detailed
                            Attitudes towards the body - @pendulum with bhakti as mean.
                                Karma - romanticise the body.
                                    @well to draw from.
                                Bhakti - Utilize the body.
                                    Eg - Ambarish M - every senses used in Krishna's service.
                                    Eg - SP take care of body and health so better if taken care of.
                                    Body is foreign dress is precise understanding.
                                Jnana - demonize the body.
                                    @sponge press then no water comes out and only pain of pressing.
                                    The very road of body is roadblock to SG.
                                        Body is a trap - trap for SG fulfullment (blind and blind about blindness) - sharira avidya jaal.
                                    Eg - Pururava - Aila Gita - body pus and even insect want to enjoy like me.
                                    Why BVT and Pururava demonize body - scriptures push pendulum to other extreme but not steady state so bring back to mean is the purpose.
                            Urge to know comes from soul - curiosity kills cat and monkeys risk lives to see other side of wall. Gossips about home, society, etc.
                                dressed by desires and dressed for the desires - lion body is fit for meat and in that place cuz desire.
                                we in culture of romanticising so demonizing the body helps even from scriptures.
                            The art of leaving the body
                                The body will give us up but we will not give up the body (bodily attachment) - till our subtle body becomes purified.
                                SUP Shankara - angam galitam, etc but still desires to enjoy exist.
                                cat seeing a rat doesn't remember ekadashi but only in human form it's possible.
                            The last thought
                                At death we will remember that in which we have sought shelter the most during our life.
                                when trouble, watch tv or cricket. Then dealth affects coherent thoughts - not natural - reversal then defaults to natural thoughts.
                                pseudo-shelters we have conditionings - PD not, but at least avoid them and go to Krishna - gravitate towards Krishna.
                                when we nothing, we come to know a lot about ourselves - that's our attachment - not observer but actor we become.
                                    So retrain the mind to Krishna.
                                It's not magical move to Krishna - smaran muktva not kirtan muktva. 
                                    godhead not, ghosthead if shooting in head.
                                    Krishna is best of cheaters.
                                    surrender to Krishna is not chance game - like accident then Krishna will remember us.
                            meaning of vishnu sahasranaam - animisha and nimisha - closes eyes to mistakes but keeps eyes open to our service.
                                Krishna not there to catch us but coach us. Coach doesn't find faults for fun but improve.
                                Krishna reciprocates to his level 
                                draupadi used sari to close blood would and he said he will repay.
                                malevolent feelings forgotten of putana in last life but only motherly feelings.
                            Krishna's unfailing love - ever waiting, willing and working.
                                we need him and not vv. in every life. Willing - so although we ditch him and against him like being atheistic. Nothing can stop Krishna from loving us.
                                @nothing can stop sun from giving light. But we can close our eyes to him.
                                working - never tired - always striving to bring us closer to him. Like medicine to child and child throws it away.
                                soul aware of Krishna's love - then he says I can't even thank you.
                            Practice now - the present is all we have and all that we will ever have.
                                9 PDS and all got perfections.
                                    devs with prominent services are highlighted and they did other services also.
                                net practice is not the real thing we think but present is not meant to be lost - same attitude gets carried.
                                    current from hand to head from SM - doesn't work that way.
                                    distractions will always be there. Time is now - urgency for spiritual life.
                                    no rosy future. Condusive is good - don't keep waiting.
                                    Later even if time comes then other things will pop up cuz of expansion and contraction of time and activities.
                                use Krishna's love for positive incentive and death for negative incentive fear based.

                            you can burn all obstacles in my path like fire. and guide by actions.
                            God is meant to help in material world - no, help me overcome obstacles to reach you.
                        Overview
                            How obstacles on the spiritual path originate.
                            Achieving perfection - the gradual way and the quick way.
                            How the omnipotent Lord guides the devotee.
                        Detailed
                            external problems thru karma and internal problems thru psychology.
                                others are so happily practicing - boat of material existence - e1 gets affected. Slip or fall.
                                past conditionings not to be blamed for fall - boat sinking to gravity - that's common cause - immediate, remote and ultimate cause. 
                                Responsibility for mistakes.
                                transcendence boat is so powerful that most sinful can overcome.
                                    only if we don't mess with the boat like drilling a hole; jump outta boat (leave DS);
                                    secret sins (holes in boat); go into storm (playing with maya going to tempting situation).
                                    in all these situations we can't blame gravity but responsibility for actions. 
                                    Not passive victims but we accepted the proposals.
                            Brahminical culture is 1 solution.
                                SM learn DS vs remove it ourselves. Sun rises fog dissipates vs try blow it away or try to see.
                                cultivate good qualities but Lord invoking is far effective.
                            Rise and Fall in KC.
                                Akarma - Rapid elevation by KC.
                                Karma - Gradual elevation by KK.
                                Vikarma - Degradation due to vikarma.
                                Karmi is negative connotation in devotee circle but KK is better than vikarmis.
                                Our goal is to not laugh at karmis but laugh with them - not degrading ourselves but elevating them.
                                    no moral superiority. KC should be presented in respectful way - not a cult with moral superiority (that's unattractive)
                                Devs VA consciousness is karma or akarma - depends on consciousness.
                                Dev's fall down has to be properly understood - first dev moves from vikarma to karma or akarma.
                                    karma and vikarma are material - maybe dragged to sin while doing karma - but protection of DS will save it - occasional relapses possible.
                            Omnipotence of lord 
                                in terms of consciousness change he can bring - dog-eater to brahmana and vv.
                                you leave rope after going up - gravity takes over - how could I fall after so many years.
                                Dog eater - low consciousness that such things are valuable to someone not a value judgment but estimate of degraded consciousness.
                                Maya makes a person fall - that's also power of Krishna's energy only.
                                Mind appears very powerful - mind's power seems like god's power - so need god to put up a competition.
                                Big person falls should increase our faith in DS - if principles are not followed then even gigantic ones can fall.
                                @Jump outta elevator - then fall to ground is bad.
                            Omnpotence of Lord meaning
                                Have More faith in his ability than doubt about our own inability.
                                when we try with Krishna then our strength is insurmountable.
                                Battle against anarthas
                                    helpless defeat
                                    struggle and defeat
                                    stuggle and success - still saying no has pain - say yes in enlightened way.
                                    effortless success - no temptation at all. Like meat eating.
                                Devotional nourishment takes us forward.
                                    @Kangri pehlvaan to powerful wrestler - but feed right person.
                            Never Give up
                                We never lose till we lose hope.
                                Krishna hasn't lost hope on us for so many lifetimes.
                                Why should we lose hope due to struggle for a few years in 1 short lifetime?
                                @If weapon is thought of as a burden then easy kill.
                                Ever willing, ever working. How long will I deprive myself of Krishna.
                                By your grace I have come. Let me proceed also.

                Spirituality - Isha
                        Vedas means knowledge - god, jiva, prakriti.
                        4 vedas - samhita.
                        vedangas (vyakaran, chhand, jyotish, nyaya, nirukta), 
                        upa-vedas (ayurveda, dhanurveda)
                        Vedanta - upanishads
                        Vedanta-sutra - SB as commentary.
                        Puranas - 6 for each MMN.
                        itihas - ramayan, mahabharat
                        smriti - sages give their as TPC.
                        Debate - ISKCON is only true path vs KC is universal science which extends beyond ISKCON - ISKCON is just 1 of the ways.
                                essence of all vedas in SP books. SB is vedanta commentary. LCM gave best from every sampradaya. SP is live link who connects us.
                                LCM gave acintya bhedabhed tattva so encompasses and surpasses.
                                Krishna gave 4 sampradaya and Krishna addresses it. Other sampradayas accept SB and others.
                                parakiya rasa highest. one of the best options or accessible, understandable. Purity is expected for initiated so not easy.
                                other religions also have KC - may not call it that.
                                we don't have monopoly over it but could we have practiceability, understading - we take clarity given to us by SP for granted. We got this so easily but people have travelled across world to find it.
                                BODD I know heard in session but do we really know. We are really fortunate to have gotten this - ISKCON - iske jaisa kon.
                                SP said practice whatever religion you can get success - @join CBSE, ICSE, etc for learning maths but there are school which specialize in maths.
                                        no business, only ahaituki apratihata.
                        Debate - we are not hindus vs we are.
                                it's an identity which can change but dharma can't change.
                                ideology is same, vedas literature same, philosophical truths same, deities and rituals are same.
                                Hinduism and KC are interlinked.
                                for outsiders we are hindus but for us, we are sanatan dharma.
                                not KK, KY, etc so much in KC so it's distinct also.
                                VA may not be at its best but preaching to Indians in western land is easier.
                                Are you hindu? - hare krishna yes - I like bollywood (cultural aspects of it so likeable). So lots of substance but form of culture is very strong.
                                Protection of sanatan dharma we have link to e1 but faithful to what's offered by our acharyas. No matter who to whatever degree to appreciate.
                                Hinduism is very wide - pantheism, etc.
                                It's never us vs them like devotee vs demons but it's us in KC pursuit vs us in material realm.
                                Christ is the way - whose son is he? can there be only 1 PD of God - sanatan dharma is full version software - eth becomes accessible like types of anarthas, appreciation of multifaceted aspect of AT. How does kingdom of god look like they can't answer but we can start brahma samhita.
                                gradation of offence that all demigods are 1 - it's mostly brahmavad they are talking subtext.
                                What gives me faith in Vedas, SP, ISKCON, etc.
                        Isa upanishad - isa - SPOG, upa - takes near; niyate - takes you, sat - knowledge.
                                vision, guidelines, prayers to appreciate AT.
                                Named after first word - eth is pervaded by supreme lord first word OR eth is avas or home of Supreme Lord.
                                after reading this, we will start perceiving truth in eth and e1 and start nth eth as nth but home of SL.
                                Kulashekar prayer dara... (45) - all vedas are stuti vacak and demigods as servants so how many! mercy as casual tip for small favors is mukti.
                                maya drama is agency of lord.
                                jnaneshvar - vish nu - to enter into and completely and pervaded.
                                universal kingdom is aesthetically so pleasing not like pegionholes of skyscapers.
                                Topics - vedas we mean, 4 defects book and also personal experiences, 3 pramanas. Do - axiomatic truths acceptance, line has dimension, imaginery number, etc.
                                        adopt steps for understanding AT.
                                Be - increased faith in vedas, SP. Vedas analogies - mother to tell father, manual for human life.
                                If you are intelligent to read 8 pages - you divide 2 pages each and then compile then together - divide and conquer.
                                anumaan - anu means follow, mana means mind. Following mind.
                                        theory we like we call them facts like darwinism for hedonism and facts we don't like call them theory like law of karma, reincarnation.
                                outdated rejected theories of past means there were mistakes.
                                4 defects start off with pratyaksha and then anumaan defects.
                                so apaurusheya - that which doesn't come from person - hear from bonafide authority - every word is imporatnt - don't ask paanwaala about relativity.
                                learn cooking - ask someone vs make it yourself and blacken your face.
                                can't figure cooking, swimming, karate without authority, why with spirituality.
                                glory of science that once in a while it matches with vedas and not other way round.
                        we use these for investigations - anumaan he went there in midnight so..., I saw it shabda, etc.
                        shabda is like mature father and others are like quarrelling children - how universe created theories vs father tells what is or what matters.
                        Now you understand the limitations of things from broad perspective of view and then they should understand.
                        yajur - event mgmt; rig - invitation; sam - praising, atharva - asking benedictions. Yajur was original and later expanded.

                Preface
                    Importance of NOI 
                        Rupa G - SP started, guided and eth - 1 man army but always credits his acaryas - here Rupa G.
                        Progression in Vedic revelation 
                            Shankar, Ramanuga, Madhva, LCM (to access Krishna's pastimes), Rupa G (associates of Lord typically play part in Krishna's plan)
                            recruited and instructions - glorify RK temples, excavate places, write literature and exemplify with preaching.
                            Representative of LCM's desire - foundations for future generations so systemized but other books are pastimes and not philosophy so much.
                            CC after training under Goswamis after blessings.
                            Gs don't focus on pastimes but random presentations for focus on philosophy.
                            Narottam also.
                            Their example is best for us - they are our heros cuz they were exemplary.
                            Gopis and Manjaris so they presented themselves as Gs - extra-ordinary devotion - not just scriptural analysis or intellectual.
                        Book is empire of wisdom - BD and number of devs to tangible measurement of movement growth.
                    Necessity of Self Mastery
                        body and soul are different - sat cit ananda vs opposite.
                        So can't enjoy really but purification to transcend.
                        @Drunkard to sober - thru better engagement and not just no saying.
                        opposite genders riveted to bodily identity and try to attract the other.
                        Not occasional feelings of peace but steady peace. 
                        we suffer from our own mind and senses or Other's mind and senses - then it's karma of past.
                        @fire and water don't go well together.
                        @anchor and rowing the boat - some success but limited.
                        SP - not against sex but god attraction but mind focus on something other than Krishna if infatuated to material.
                        Come to MOG and then Krishna's inner voice also audible - revelations happen.
                    The right attitude for advancement : I can become a goswami.
                        Not just positive attitude that's famous today.
                        Talking about sense and mind control based on the context. If determined then eventually you will get it.
                        Control senses and Lord is conquered by those who have conquered their mind and senses.
                        easier to make spiritual advancement with these instructions - easier so in general it is tough and relatively easier
                            @traffic rules then easy to navigate and road laid out then easy.
            </Preface>
            <Shraddha>
                About - 2nd verse on unfavorable and 3rd verse on favorable.
                T1-3 - these faculties help us serve Krishna but also put dangers.
                    better vehicle for better service - so mastery over body for better service so not pride but purpose.
                    @mastery of fighter plane but purpose is important and not to flaunt in front of enemies.
                    body has no desires like plane - but default programs or tendencies which we get carried away.
                        mind is not thing - only dead - default programs - like PC, repeated choices then it becomes default option.
                        focus here is regulation of our tools for good KC and not extremes on body.
                    T1_1
                        Title: Combating the urges of speech, mind and anger.
                            Vega - urge or or urgency or speed vs desire which is not urgent like 7 wonders, niagra falls.
                            vaca - karmendriya tongue. jihva - jnanedriya tongue. Anger, gentials, belly, mind.
                            Qualifications of guru - first this is book on guidance for practitioner right so why guru's qualifications.
                                finding a guru - so look for these qualities. Positive qualities of attraction to Krishna is later.
                                seeker should aspire to become a seer - clear mindset.
                                    LCM showed pastimes and attachment to Krishna but also detachment from Krishna.
                            SP immediately goes to point of parikshit M after canto 5 hell - how to control sins.
                                levelled understanding based answers are revealed like how many demigods - reducing to 3 to 1.
                                atonement - prisoner but again crime, confessions.
                                Cultivation of knowledge - still mentality doesn't change. Body understsanding exists and independent of Krishna.
                        Overview
                            Atonement

                        Detailed
                            Just reforming is trap of MOP to MOG.
                            austerity - like fasting on ekadashi.
                            @consciousness is room and diamond of Krishna and thief outside of door - lock and never let him in.
                                no fight and force thief out if it enters inside.
                                Thoughts comes in - blood tasted then fight greater but still fight - push thief out.
                                shama and dama - shama is better else dama - forceful stopping.
                                tapa is not spiritual in itself - but better if spiritual - celibacy without spirituality is difficult but possible.
                            these are condusive for DS - but reject them when not favorable.
                                Eg - LCM - brahmana and sannyasi and distances to both and says I am servant of gopis.
                            Vaco - problem karmis and jnanis
                                @snake and toad
                                    Consumes us and time goes away.
                                Krishna katha (not silence)
                                    it's fortune - formally on vyasa-asana or informally to 1-2 ppl.
                                    very dear such person is.
                            Manasau
                                Can't have vaccum - Attracts anarthas
                                    thinking can still stop but not mind.
                                    can't freeze the mind - not just bottle of alcohol but branching from there.
                                    hyperactive than senses - give avenue of thinking.
                                Solution - Meditate on lotus feet of Krishna.
                                    @Krishna like sun and maya has no authority there.
                                    can't punch darkness or cut by sword or curse - only light does it.
                                    fill mind with Krishna. Chanting mechanical also good but not very transformational - find unique ways.
                                        philosophy, deity, darshan, kirtans, dancing, devotee listening, etc.
                                        process is universal but application is personal and we have uniqueness both spiritual and materially.
                                        we have all facilities but focus on Krishna is my responsibility.
                            Krodha
                                Can't be stopped.
                                    1 anartha that e1 agrees as bad is krodha.
                                    detrimental and dangerous - especially with devs.
                                    some negligence then not serious - not intention to harm a dev.
                                Apply against blasphemers, Jag and Mad, Hanuman, Arjuna.
                                    thin line of I using it in Krishna's service or anger using me in Maya's service.
                                    Motivation - my good name will be spoilt. Hanuman - OMG! what if sita affected by fire.
                                        My motivation maybe pure but other is affected by it.
                                        Eg - assertively for taken seriously - like snake with naradmuni I never asked you to not hiss.
                                            taking firm stand with ppl is good - like snake guidance.
                                    doesn't mean start blasting them but guidance properly.
                                        Eg - Daksha and Siva - curses and counter-cursing - devastation. Was consequence desirable or not.
                                            can't take principles in isolation - all associates started cursing - situations becoming worse - not that afraid of confrontations.
                                        use anger or passion to channel the energy to refute misconception and not wild energy but channelled energy.
                            T1_2 - Title : Combating the urges of tongue, belly and genitals.
                            Jihva - taste and udara - quantity (2 are interrelated)
                                Forced to eat karmi shops.
                                damn if you do and damn if you don't.
                                    quality and quantity of food is bad for us.
                                    Marketing of food is unprecedented. Look down on obese and visually untouchable.
                                    Cultural glamorization of being thin and eating.
                                        getting beaten - unsatiable and irresistable. can't win and can't quit.
                                    Trouble - can't fulfill all demands - limitations of body, resources, lifespan. So live with unfulfilled desires.
                                    Fasting - gorge on one day and fast on next day - not biochemical mechanism of body.
                                Is sense control spiritual? Hiranya was controlled in senses but far from spirituality - not separate virtue but helps in KC.
                                Solution - Prasada - scheduled times and be grateful as Krishna supplies accept as mercy.
                                    within this limitation there is endless possibility.
                                    attached to sumptuous prasadam - conscious level - may not see it as Krishna.
                                    Deity is transcendental but behaves materially likewise prasad - depends a lot on our consciousness.
                                    Feast occasionally is ok.
                                    Fasting on ekadashi and special days - not torture for body - not fat reducing exercise says kulshekhar.
                                        should not be good forgetting the best.
                                        I want Krishna more than other things.
                                        Body fasting and ego feasting also not good. 
                                        Desires focussed exclusively on Krishna and no longer feel material torment like Parikshit.
                                        Levels - Nirjal (ayurved not recommended), Sajal (pending work of body also done), fluid fasting (juice), fruits, veggies, no-grain, etc.
                                        Physical distraction helps KC but if distracted then better take food and serve.
                                        Nice prasadam on ekadashi then forgetting the point.
                                    Quantity and Quality of food is important.
                                        hunger is generic but specific food is not fuel but pseudo-hunger.
                                            Mind's need it is and can be fulfilled.
                                        Overeat then MOP mode or sleep.
                                        frequency also - how frequent prasadam be taken 
                                            LCM eaten by Sarvabhaum B - immediately take prasadam - idea is transformation of Saurvabhaum has increased than adherence of rules.
                                            We think of prasad as opportunity to enjoy and not service - keeping times regulated is better - don't judge others but ourselves.
                                            50-25-25 stomach filling - not too much or too little but from experience we will know. Digestions, urges and pattern recognition.
                            Udara Upastha
                                Sex not rejected - not contrary to religious principles.
                                Restrictive married sex life - too much intrusion.
                                    glamorizing so sexual stimulation - physical release and no intimacy - it is sacred and valuable that procreation - new life.
                                    we make it so trivial like relieve boredom. We become procreators with God thru sex so it's sacred.
                                    unregulated then all sort of sexual crimes.
                                    it has purpose so act as per purpose.
                                no unnecessary sex; KC kids.

                                    not to avoid being informed but knowing every single thing is too much.
                                    Information is so much diverse from function these days.
                                    Radar of curiosity guided to trivial things 
                                        like quiz - how many wives this actor has? endless spree for knowledge with no utility.

                                virodha yukta krodha
                                Scriptures give Framework of thinking not hair splitting analysis - krodha as subcategory or independent.
                            Body - 
                                About - linearity in one line - but desires are in mind? Physical affects mental. Lie when study induces sleep.
                                Tongue - 
                                    BVT prasadam. CC refs.
                                        thank god for food is a good consciousness. I die without it - good! That's recognition so gratitude.
                                        trapped in material existence and senses drag us down for endless cycle so tough situation and Krishna gives us hope thru prasadam.
                                            other senses also affected by tongue.
                                            we take prasadam and get energy - radha krishna guna gao.
                                    6 types of demands.
                                        tamas - dead bodies; maha tamas - intoxicants.
                                        rajas - spicy
                                        Sattva - milk, grains, etc.
                                        Prasad - offering delicious foods.
                                        Prasad in MMN - visiting for food.
                                            prasad is not in MMN but we are and degree of consciousness.
                                            Pizza prasad was shock for ppl in India first - western delicacy.
                                            it's not cultural comodity but spiritual principle - offer to Krishna and take remnants.
                                            different ppl take different food - not carcass of jivas krishna takes.
                                            cultural expression or translation for spiritual principle can be different.
                                            No rule against chinese food - we think more on chinese than Krishna. Rock kirtan - some think more of rock than kirtan.
                                                desire so strong then no need to deny it. Not that pizza prasad is less prasad but accept most favorable.
                                            SP wanted traditional culture but bridge isn't 1 way traffic - but other things also come. 
                                            Not bad but know what's happening - what's anukul and what's pratikul.
                                Belly - not to deprive but reprieve.
                                    Stomach disease.
                                    Fasting for ekadashi and festivals.
                                Genitals
                                    5 types - artificial.
                                    Marriage and kids.
                        Choices to either feed senses or Krishna - 
                            Krishner matir astu 
                            godasa or goswami.
                                adant gobhir vishatam tamishram - keep eating same old then hopeless.
                                    caught up in material enjoyment then consciousness can't become spiritual and experience spiritual happiness.
                                    verse should make us sober but sincere about the medicine. That's the only solution.

                    Bhakti destroyed by over-eating, overendeavor, prajalpa, focus on rules, bad association, greed for material.
                    implicated in external energy of lord being marginal. High thinking means higher pursuits of life - move towards internal energy.

                            Overendeavors - so much that neglects spiritual life else endeavors are good.
                                Sometimes so much infatuation with work - that no time for home and health.
                                    glamorized but all dimensions be balanced.
                                    no static but dynamic balance - like cycle driving - cycle has to be tilted to take turn for end goals.
                                Escapes in frustrations - brothels, factories, liquor dens.
                            Prob - less time for inquiry.
                            solution - simple living. SB 1.2.10
                        Prajalpa - @frog.
                            
                        Niyamagrahah - agrah and aagrah (reject enjoyer and overdoes ritualist)

                            REL stock market. Bhakta sane vasa.

                        advantage of avoiding them.
                            ideal society
                            enemity destroyed
                            economic maladjustments connected
                            political stability
                            spiritual community established
                            cause of spiritual awakening - ISKCON - education, training.
                                consciousness is scientific word. yes, famous in 60s in US but lately few decades and Krishna consciousness.
                                facilitie and support systems.
                                Institutions - religions corruption. power corrupts. Small stream of water - but meeting not merging 
                                    1 drop can't make it to ocean but together it makes it to ocean.
                                    Material minded can't stick to sadhana - inst gives support systems for all.
                                    don't expect eutopian society - focus on essence and get the best - individual and global welfare.

                        atyahar
                            nirahar dehina - aahar for all the senses. Aahar for ego - ownership, and accumulation also.
                            heart is meant to be filled - all other possessions degrees and data in head are misdirections of desires for Krishna.
                                essence of bhakti is saying yes to Krishna. Saying no to pleasant is difficult.
                                Not that devotee means be under poverty line.
                            boat load of gold by Gs - kshatriyas should have. Devotional culture and charity giving and money earned cuz tax collection services.
                                nothing distracted them from spiritual life. Ministers made for some reason - competence and character.
                                protection and propagation in their time they used their money for.
                                what's manageable anxiety for me and what's unmanageable has to be estimated - like loan too much ain't good as per salary.
                                urge to take up anxiety is atyahar.
                        prayas - festivals, yatra so reprioritize. Harmonize every aspect with spiritual.
                            compare spiritual performance with material performance - why so little to Krishna.
                            endeavor in spiritual life - chanting is hard work and KK for relief but philsophy is exhausting
                                KC relaxes us by exercising us.
                                @muscle building - later lifting other things becomes easy. Exercise involves exertion.
                            not shirk from exertion in spiritual life.
                        Title - Avoiding Prajalpa and niyamagrah
                        Prajalpa - talk + useless.
                            vaco vega in last verse - what's new 
                                last verge was body perspective regulation - urges perspective.
                                Here is devotional perspective - spiritually harmful.
                                Like nonveg and alcohol - there can be overlap - materially and spiritually both they are bad. 
                                Some things can be materially good but spiritually not so much.
                            Bhisma instructs to yudhisthir - long conversation
                                speech on lord, pleasing, truthful, useless, blasphemous speech.
                                    pleasing is above truthful - so don't agitate others thru speech. Austerity of speech.
                                    spiritualize our speaking power - detrimental be avoided.
                                    blasphemous to malign them or rumors based - very injurioius and mad elephant offence can destroy bhakti.
                                    rumor based prajalpa - warrior on battlefield - send to hospital but sent to jail - violence it is - all have their challenges - no dev comes with intent of hypocritical.
                                        if we can't help practically, at least pray for them.
                                    I didn't join KC to gossip about others. Purpose is to be KC.
                                        grivances on websites - I am losing the point and poisons the atmosphere.
                                        Krishna is desire tree - we get what we want.
                                        power, money, controversy - you will get it all in ISKCON but purpose lost.
                                    Seniors can fall for blaspheming then walk away from there.
                                    SP was more angry with devotee who spread information than 1 who fell from standards.
                                    e1 needs some basic respect. Can't follow standards then make apt changes.
                                    can't let them compromise standards but compassionate and being sensitive.
                            prajalpa can sap our spiritual energy.
                                material world - we can have faults. Surprise is who stays not who leaves.
                                Advaitacarya's children became mayavadis - a little peculiar.
                            infection can be on anyone even best of doctor. 
                                Disease metaphor has limitations - we are active players with anarthas, not entirely victims.
                                potency of process is application then works and neglected then lost 
                                krishna:light::maya:darkness. Talking about them is just Krishna unconscious.
                        Niyamagrah - rules are like road and principles are like compass.
                            rules are best ways to follow principles - principles automatically get followed.
                            iceberg in way thru compass then we take around it. compass was meant to help us only.
                            Eg - Principle - temple is place to glorify the Lord and share glories with others.
                                storefront into temples no gopuram possible and facing east - sun god seen and obeissance and views and aesthetics, etc.
                                insisting rules but forgetting purpose behind them.
                                judgment without fact about situation - TPC based.
                            Bhisma paid obeissance in mind and accepted and dhruva's deity accordingly.
                            Brahmins superiority based on birth but respect is important - praised cuz of connection to Krishna - neither qualities, culture or knowledge but birthright became eth wrong.
                                converted to other religions and brahmins didn't care - oh lower births.
                            As devs 
                                letter of law. Impose rules without their TPC understanding - underline SP books - how can you do it.
                                    like deity, can't underline. remember and recall so mark.
                                    that's decoration of deities 
                                    matters of preference into principles make us fanatic.
                                MB - Krishna tells Arjuna - na hi sarvatra vidhiyate - there ain't rule for eth.
                                deity worship standardization of inst - can do in sensitive ways but too much intrusion be avoided.
                                Eg - 3 chapattis for gurukul boys - not really that way - bodies are different. Central core - unchanging but periphery should change.
                                SP was adept at adapt and adopt.
                                    many different from BSST - always dhoti kurta but BSST went in pant shirt.
                                    nothing changed in essentials but peripherals can be changed.
                                no elaborate args for God's existence - that's implied truth in BG. DYS is just prep for BG.
                                    cultural contexts change over time.
                                slavery time - bow down - bowing to senior dev in KC - some ppl get reminder of slavery so think of a cult.
                                    conflicts in dev community.
                            rejection - oh that's irrelevant.
                                whimsical giving up not ok.
                                dev at different levels of commitment is ok but not rejecting the core.
                                prefered traditional dress - Indian dress - it's not indian but dev dress.
                                dev is matter of heart - so clothes should not matter.
                                    heart doesn't exist in vaccum independent - some dresses are condusive and chaste, simple.
                                    dresses highlighting the bodily contours of the body agitate others and divert attention to bodily consciousness.
                                    nothing stops from chanting HK - but do that's condusive for yourself and others also.
                                    we have to do to realize it. Externals affect internals - postures affect psychology - cant feel humble with hand on head.
                                    saari reveal body in middle - dress changed to vulgarity not from bollywood standards.
                                        flashy dresses - so certain dresses favor certain principles.
                            with following rules - automatically attraction to Krishna increases.
                        Title - Avoiding Jana Sanga and laulya
                        Jana Sanga - Vishnu jana or bhurida janah. Jana means ppl.
                            attachment / association of ordinary people. But attachment and association are also related (like cricket club in college)
                            Loving devotional association - automatically desires develop.
                            worldly minded people - association not just physical proximity.
                                @fly sitting on guru - blood or pus but nothing spiritual.
                                emotional sharing is association. 25 yrs to temple or neighbors but not inclined for whatever reason cuz emotional worlds are separate.
                                    emotions are connected to desires. Infectious affect when college cheers when world cup final sixer.
                                    emotions are feelings that come to up and Desires are aspirations or cravings for certain things.
                                        both produce each other.
                                    Cricket are non-devotional cuz no regs breaking but lusty talks is anti-devotional.
                                    @like clubs, KC forum is for coming together and why, what and how KC.
                                Kaal Krishna dasa - left LCM to enjoy with women. Reinstated himself. Repentent and came back to KC.
                                pervert delights in web sites when friends showed some videos and affected - intel lost.
                                Ajamila - scandalous threw e1 away for woman he fell in love with.
                                    thinking of sense object -> way till intelligence lost (as per BG).
                                intellectually attack our faith - eth so chaotic - rains fall in ocean - makes us think.
                                    at level of desires still makes us feel lower but doubts makes us feel superior.
                                    these people don't understand so left.
                                    1 person unclean but all rooms clean - all clean rooms indicate presence of design and plan but unclean room might have a reason that we may not know.
                                    provision of needs but shortages for karma - Krishna gives them reasons for their faith.
                                    faith destroyed eg Kaikeyi affected by Manthara. Jewel given by kaikeyi.
                                        I am doing for bharat she thought but bubble of imaginery fantasies burst - what have I done when justifications no longer there.
                                    Internet can destroy thru some rumors 
                                    @tree growing takes years but cutting takes hours.
                        Laulyam - laulyam and atyahar similar but purpose is not to do hair splitting analysis.
                            vs atyahar - urge for more then prayas - have to jan sangasya - laulya also comes up. More extrinsic than atyahar.
                            SP focuses on sustained desires that take us away - bhukti, mukti, siddhi - ashant.
                                insatiable desires these are.
                            Priorities keeping - Maya comes in gross or subtle ways for seniors - confusing priorities - lower KC in the list. 
                                So keeping Krishna on top priority is our job.
                                ye yatha maam prapadyante - not higher taste then lower taste appears more attractive and serious devotees are thus violated by maya.
                                @driving / pilot - bring it back when it goes astray.
                                    deviations should be corrected regularly - small deviations are natural or inevitable. So, principles.
                                    forgetting our forgetfulness is worse - BVT says don't start afresh for mistakes in KC.

                            Gopis love for Krishna cuz of their commitments not feelings.
                            Yes left eth for calling Krishna - pleasure there is easy. for giving up headache of Krishna - willing to go to hell.
                            @child cries - not pat her back for pleasure but disturbs her own sleep for selfless service.
                            shallow love or pseudo Bible Story - my child story - let child be cut and both have them - 1 very badly affected and agreed to give child to the other.
                                observe the manipulation or smartness of the king - manipulate situations understanding the behaviors expected of a mother.
                            SP left Vrindavan - substance is practical activity.
                                washing their utensils. Gaudiya math you can't even serve to sanyasi if not initiated.
                                Safe to assume we are not advanced 
                            advancement is giving ecstasy to Krishna not myself.
                                purports are my devotional ecstasies says SP.
                                SP criticizing factories when translation is about Krishna leaving Dwaraka
                                cuz it gives Krishna ecstasy - what keeps jiva divorced from Krishna - that's Krishna's concern - removing those obstacles.
                            silent meditation also acharyas practiced but chanting verbally SP recommended.
                            Gurudas Pr - sweet picture of Vrindavan before. SP Deep in thought and no words.
                                words of nectar from SP hankering - not disturb PD's meditation also - sth about RK, glories of Vrindavan or Krishna, etc 
                                SP's 1st word shattered my misconceptions - "cement" - arrange cement for temple.
                                consciousness up there but action right here - engage in practical devotional service.
                                PD sees stone, pebbles, gold equally - application in richer context - cement in PDS so valued as much as gold 
                                potential for engagement in Krishna's service.
                            Devotional service - external and internal component - devotion and service.
                                service is vehicle and engine of devotion.
                                vehicle
                                    why raise hands in public - it is not exhibition but expression - like mother for child.
                                    advanced or not - by practical service - love is not just noun but also a verb.
                                    activities in spiritual world - not that they meditate on each other - constant activity there.
                                    churn butter for Krishna yashoda does and Krishna for yashoda for her pleasure.
                                    what are you doing for Krishna - should be asked.
                                by service our devotion gets raised so also a fuel or engine.
                                    amnesia - showing stimuli of past life retrieve memory 
                                        similarly devotional stimuli awakens us spiritually.
                                        love is not acquired but revived.
                                        stimuli of 9 proc DS.
                        End all non sense activities Bhakti takes not just - to 0 but also 0 to +
                            Prahlad says 9 proc DS. Only smaranam is passive all others are actions.
                            before we understand 6 things that help DS - we have to first understand DS so it's all background for 6 favorable activities for DS.
                    Enthu - persevere with intel.
                        wanna cook but don't know how - then useless.
                        visible - jumps high in kirtan but not most important - happiness is devotional or body kinestheics - audio and vision and with devs and deities but not most imp.
                            sustained commitment.
                        devotion is not activities connected with Krishna or God - no1 beyond Krishna - I am source of eth - eth can be used in Krishna's service - so dictaphone SP used.
                        Internet used for KC nowadays but hitherto not so.
                        so also in creativity enthru is visible.
                    Nishcayat
                        lofty teachings in DS acaryas and other paths are not excluded.
                    Title: Cultivating Patience and Following regulative principles
                        enthu, patience and confidence.
                            @Journey - confidence, energy to go there and persistence cuz it takes time.
                                faith that bhakti will take me back to Krishna.
                                Lover of material things to Krishna will take time.
                            @crops - fencing, seeds, water, manure - bhakti is cultivation.
                                wrt heart - right culture for nourishment is important.
                                faith that eth is right crops should come out. Enthu but crops will take time.
                    Nishcayat
                        shraddha - KDK - if Krishna bhakti then all duties will be performed.
                            @stomach fed and body gets nourishment.
                        kali faults but intel worship kali - actual purpose is realized easily.
                        bhakti doesn't stop fall down - that's free will of soul - but deeper higher taste is a guarantee.
                            brahman not overflowing joy but joy of bhakti is higher.
                        DS is so pure and perfect that dragged to perfection.
                            but Krishna doesn't force. Whatever fall but no loss and attraction so rich that material happiness can't equate.
                            KDK - bhakta is haunted by ghost of rasa.
                            body desire easy access and very conscious but soul's desires subconscious and difficult to take our.
                                but we think material enjoyment we are not trying properly. But that's not the problem.
                            Material existence is STD - e1 born of sex.
                            Anti-devotional going down the well but more effort to come back.
                            Another way to look at it is - Krishna doesn't let; he ensures without infringement.
                            I as conditioned self is the enemy of I as soul. Seems abstract conception.
                            Not soul but conditionings around soul need to be purified.
                        Bhakti isn't about position but disposition.
                            opulence can stabilize but also distract from bhakti.
                            JASS - Janma Aishwarya Shruta Shribhir (birth, riches, etc)
                            VA demanding how bhakti time - or in crisis - aligning. He is more powerful than eth that exists.
                                Eg - SP reciprocated by Krishna.
                                adversity as opportunity to see magic of Krishna 
                                flute and obstacle disappears not that though it's possible but not always but experience deep DS.
                    Patience
                        @medicine taken so some time required for cure.
                        prescription, apply it and purified with time.
                        is 64 rounds 4 times faster to reach than 16 - offensive chanting and not a race of rounds but attraction cultivation.
                            bhakti is reciprocal not mathematical.
                        @child birth - similarly SM gives knowledge to disciple and Krishna is born in heart.
                    Regulative principles
                        for sake of morality, bring the conception of transcendence.
                            Masses is opium for religion and not vv as Karl Marx says - dilute, pervert or contaminate it.
                                Marx presented world history as class struggles.
                                Mass with dilution, perversion or contamination practices can affect religious impression.
                                    it's ok if you can't stop eating meat but gimme donations for sure ok.
                                    sugar you take but continue medicine taking - process is slowed.
                                    contamination - pious like demigod worship. paap based.
                                    perversion - bhakti process destroyed - I am god and chant my names.
                                        Spirituality then head on vacation ppl think anything that feels good.
                                        good feelings are cheaper - some music show is enough. So don't make spirituality that cheap.
                                If our goal is to please masses then we or religion gets lost.
                                    bhakti practices taken up by millions in kali is anyways difficult.
                                    only caricature of religion remains.
                                    presented message in appealing way vs chanting message to appeal.
                                LSD - chemical but league of spiritual discovery. Something joyful.
                                    in their language - SP - reduce HN down to sth material - it may seem offensive - you must give up 
                                    use material to explain the spiritual and not reduce spiritual down to material.
                            bhakti should stimulate our heads and not make it stop working
                            religion which binds humanity to divinity.
                        there's a process which does it - any concoction that won't work.
                    Title: Giving up bad association and following in the right footsteps
                    Give up bad association 
                        harernaam harenaam - 8 times most emphatic way of telling - repetition not carelessness, incoherence but in revealed scripture.
                        double repetition - cardinal principle not to be rejected.
                        negative point while all others were positive points - why?
                            negative desies will reduce and be open to other positive desires.
                            material desires get produced thru interactions.
                            sanskar memories are individual fights but outside source also should be minimized - carriers of desires.
                            not moral superiority that I am purer but simple essential health principle - for my health, avoid 7 who is too sick.
                                respect even a tree.
                                infection should not come you - caution.
                                I am superior to them as fact - we have process to raise but they don't so not superior we have all such desires.
                            can't take spirituality immediately so at least take medicine.
                                principled compromise vs compromise principle - rejected vs could not follow so given facility so principled compromise.
                                slower recovery program is ok but should be told as such - don't make it standard principle.
                                    slowly curing diabetes cuz you can't practice.
                                grihasta life vs not practice if not brahmacari.
                        Avoid them doesn't mean we stop talking to them
                            if look down on them they won't ever come to Krishna.
                            harmful association to be avoided.
                            non-devotional is ok but anti-devotional is strictly to be avoided.
                            mercy for innocent, envy keep distance and favorable associate.
                            anti-devotional is constant attack on our DS.
                            Our behavior should not take ppl away from Krishna.
                            LCM - asatsang tyagat aiyi vaishnava acar.
                            Blood, power territory lust of navab hussain shah and all.
                                architect killed cuz he could make better building. Not in future and why not now.
                                rampage earlier but desecration, so many holy ppl - can't kill e1 so compromise - no public practice and only at home.
                                LCM broke that curfew.
                                Rupa G and Sanatan G - Saraswat - broke principles and chose bad association - required for service.
                                affected by bad association? no, not affected - in heart cherishing KC. Heart in right place and not mlecchas.
                                letter writing very difficult vs email today. LCM took note and blessed them when they came.
                                circumstantially - taking and even going deeper into bad association.
                                safe enclave for devs. Message to more people.
                        Association to share values else we go sw else and start others' values.
                            forum to come together to reciprocate care and love and evolve.
                            friends - close, cordial, formal, flairs paths clashes.
                    Sato Vritti - transcendental circles.
                        asat and their vrittis is MOP/MOI. Sat is MOG.
                        death is a guru.
                        @Stairs and stars - stairs take us to stars. mind gravitates to Krishna is reached stars.
                        catch it whenever we get it and not that they don't care.
                        Loneliness is not solution. Not all in dev association so in devotee circle also get MOG and values we admire and wanna emulate.
                        Love at sight - lust at sight and love maybe in future with time.
                        Enthu, Patience, Faith - Pure Goodness.
                            110 - Goodness
                            101 - Passion
                            000 - Ignorance.
                        Skills cultivation for service is good or already have so engaged is good.
                        surgery - written statement of operation and not remove more than agreed on.
                            so focus on right MOG association - not associate with infected.
                            minimize association with opposite sex - not they are affected by lust
                            but person is getting affected but by way she is - association of women and attached to women - who's left.
                            great danger and good association is reqd. Intoxication and worldly desires should decrease.
                            SG association is drinking poison - who's left and I am SG in many ways - must do but official and not emotional.
                            Bonding is by sharing joys and sorrows together not physical.
                            Vish kills 1 life but vishaya kills many lives.
                            Non devs no practice so desire of why am I in KC and with devs - so many better than I so I get inspiration.

                    bhojayate - to enjoy food - nothing wrong with it.
                    external activities affect internals - can't see heart.
                        helps access internal - like wears, tilak, etc.
                        heart's affection has to be expressed - lakshanam - symptoms.

                                Guhyam - never inquire; confidentiality
                                Akhyati - never give or accept invitation to associate intimately.
                                Prichhati - by intermingling one is affected.
                                Negative injunction! do not give or take anything.
                                bhunkte bhojayate - never give or accept food CC Madhya and antya.
                            Why - poisonous associaton - @snake and milk. bananas.
                                Any information will be used to promote materialism and oppose KC.
                                Unless one is very advanced he is unable to utilize e1's contribution for furthering KC.
                                Principle - we should not accept charity from mayavadis and atheists.
                            Dadati - advanced devs give at least 50%
                                Rupa G - 50% Krishna, 25% family and 25% savings.
                                Whatever the income - 50%
                    Details
                        Businessman - some feast in their honor and gifts exchange and then mutual concerns discussed - political consequences.
                        eb does these exchanges but devs for bringing Krishna in center - acts similar - most principles also but purposes differ.
                        desires are ajaran - don't grow old but grow stronger with time if fed properly.
                        Temples 6 exchanges - scripture lives thru those who live scriptures.
                            have to go attend class then heart not involved. If not attentive, still if BG spoken by sanjay and he relished - although dhritarashtra didn't change
                            both sincere that's best but 1 sided also is powerful.
                            SP used to offer apple - even when he had nothing. Stomach to heart.
                            Kitchen religion - kitchen ananda - so many recipes.
                            SP cooked for BSS day in noon that's convention.
                        This is our culture itself
                            sudama went to Krishna to give something - way of expressing affection.
                            you satisfied whole world - wanted to give him best but also understood sudama's affection.
                        LCM - thickened relp with devs. Scholar to travelled then stopped preaching.
                            sweet will and plan and that also preached - enter into devs hearts - wanted to please him afterwards.
                            Rupa G - govardhan and deities more valuable than all wealth he renounced.
                            Sanatan G - nasty pus - embraced him again - we love we chastise and outsiders respect - you gimme bitter juice of praise and jaga you chastise.
                            siddha bakul and away cuz they served muslims and away from puri.
                            flattery or obligation - A to B about B vs A to C about B - that's respect and real appreciation.
                            public appreciation of their poetry - how they understood my heart.
                            after recruitment and never met but always in heart.
                        SP - genius at this. 
                            loving reciprocations. NY - book store - commission if books sold. I like Indian samosas - big tray next time.
                        How we can do
                            gift giving - intent and content - both are important.
                                intent > content - even patram pushpam I accept if with devotion.
                                    some charity to temple - PDS helped by it but not enough.
                                        if consciousness is how charitable I am then consciousness not guided to Krishna.
                                    offer heart to Krishna else give what in our heart to Krishna - part of heart - sacrifice of what's so dear.
                                    inspiration for others and little fame also maybe needs of other ppl.
                                intent shapes content - @mother says I love child but you eat soup and I eat feast.
                                    words of appreciation, physical presence, tangible gifts - love languages.
                                    what do they truly value.
                            In family also - automatically not that eth will come out.
                                birthday wishes - ed be birthday by some buddhists considering past lives.
                                Rites of passage - life sanskars in vedic time but birthdays etc in these modern days for urban ppl.
                                    just devs doing birthday together is not devotional or spiritual in itself but need to keep Krishna in center.
                                don't alienate by saying how big you stool bag has become on birthday.
                                emotional bank account - terms change with time but concept is same - withdrawl and invest. Keep it positive.
                                these kinda gestures - Rupa G is telling the same thing here in NOI.
                            Prasadam is way of affection - unspiced veggies but huge feast and navadveep offering food to LCM.
                                LCM lord and others at least saw as great sanyasi who affected saurvabhaum and giving foods from shops when LCM asked for feast.
                                Santan G taking buttermilk and feast - both are gloried - not dry spirituality but engaged spirituality.
                                sunday love feast - came from hippie jargon - krishna feast on bhakti and devs feast on mercy. Consumers taste both.
                            paradox - jihva vegam and here bhojayate - if not sense control, can't even enjoy materially. else focus on how much; 
                                sense control but exchanges.
                                sin feasts - devs should not think like this but devotional affection.
                        Title: Having heart to heart discussion with devotees.
                            superficial or deep relationships.
                            svarupa Damodar and ramanand ray - very intimate devs.
                            Krishna consciousness is highest joy 2 devs can have when come together - sex for materialists.
                            for us, Krishna in head and heart to some degree and we share.
                            2 devs have service to Krishna.
                                Dwaraka queen to Draupadi how serving 5 pandavas - No superiority but learning.
                            Morning walks emerged spontaneously - relaxed world and new light of seeing world, intimate and sweeter mood.
                                Krishna in world; service and SP would guide. cheating and trust and practicality.
                                G Harrison - music so you sing about Krishna.
                                Later learnt that ppl want SG and fit you in a certain mood and Harrison wasn't quite fitting there for ppl after he started HK songs.
                                I am causing ppl to go away from Krishna and SP - toned down - don't do it too much.
                                go to Krishna dielemma of going away from world.
                            GSS approach Krishna.
                            maintaining confidentiality of devs - counselor can't speak it to others without permissions of counsellee.
                                e1 has challenges and escalate only if too serious.
                                No1 is problem free. no1 drops from womb with tilak and bead bag.
                                US against UK those days - All of us hang together or all of will hang together.
                            Sita abducted by Ravan - seduction by opulence temptations- no. Threats of eaten as breakfast.
                                Seduction by deception - Ram's head thrown at her.
                                Vibhishan's wife friendship so consoled her and don't you hear the fight sounds nth is won.
                                Not theoretical but experience Krishna's shelter in daily battles of life.
                            Doesn't mean to accept others' emotional garbage.
                                don't have to hear everything - our past and other is agitated.
                                not sordid details of eth.
                            fanatical understanding is fools and rascals on seeing them - sensationalist values but myths that they are rascals.
                                confronted mayavad - cultured in presentation not beating mayavadis.
                                some occasions may require that in govt - religions and tradition and don't care for specific institution like ISKCON - maybe minority.
                                bad association when transfer of desires.
                                we are there for service - vague idea of spirituality and think merging as goal not strictly mayavadis but only influenced.
                                know "too much" to be helped - so keep safe distance.
                                SP would treat mayavadis in very cultured way.
                                same culture coming from vedas but cultured but uncompromising on principles.
                                CC - vishayer anna khayile dushit hoye man (sth along those lines).
                            50-25-25 charity - ideal but too much it seems - not to make us feel bad. Gap between ideal and real.
                                stair and there are stars - reach stars thru stairs.
                                in future I will give charity - harmful for spiritual life - charity is attitude not act. Offering back to Krishna.
                                Not amount but attitude - give little if can't give a lot cuz of financial situations - not habit of giving.
                                50% after retiring not thru life - yes we don't know thru life.
                                doing eth for devotional culture and not haggling over figures.
                                charity and what we get in return - dadati prati grahnati - Krishna place in heart we get.
                T5: Title: Associating properly with 3 levels of devotees.
                    multi-levls and deal with them differently.
                    respect 1 who chants god's name - Kanishtha.
                    initiated then obeissance and deities - serious worship - Madhyam.
                    worships Krishna and doesn't like to criticize (not outta fear of backlash but inclination lacking) - associate with - uttam adhikari.
                    SM should be advanced madhyama or uttam adhikari.
                    Madhyama understands all about me and Krishna and deal badly with others ain't ok but life is part of bhakti but not bhakti is part of life.
                    kanishtha thinks that just rituals is enough - it's necessary not sufficient.
                    different levels of respect for devotees.
                    hanker for uttama - permeated with such desires and other desires get silenced.
                    Overview
                        Kanishtha
                            worships only deity
                            Behaves badly with devotees (doesn't value not intentionally)
                            Harinama initiated trying to chant.
                            Playable faith soft and unsteady.
                        Madhyama
                            Prema - Krishna is the object of love.
                            Kripa - merciful
                            Fixed up - surrendered to KC process.
                            CC diksha kale bhakta.
                            Maitri - friends with devs.
                            Upeksha - avoids the envious.
                            Inconclusive - Knowledge of shastra.
                            Undeterred - Continues process in any circumstance.
                            Faithful - fixed in chanting.
                        Uttama
                            Uncritical - even if PD criticizes.
                                Without false ego or envy
                                out of great pain or regret.
                                hate disease not diseased
                                To protect newcomer's faith
                            Pure - free from anarthas.
                            Self realized.
                            Seriously engaged in Lord's service.
                            Strict in following 4 regs.
                            Disinterested in material enjoyment
                            Converts - BVT Vaishnava converts many to vaishnavism.
                            Expounds or spreads KC.
                            Guru - Best Guru.
                            Offenseless.
                        Interactions with Uttama adhikari - Cycle as follows:
                            Serve
                            With faith (shraddha)
                            Inquire
                            Associate
                    Details
                        Many acaryas use this terminology but differences exist.
                            BVT - kanistha see externals, madhyama intellectual (substance they see) and uttam - spiritual vision beyond substance.
                            He said this to flatter in his book - Krishna samhita is a complex book.
                            SB also mentions without using terms. But Rupa G in other books.
                        adhikari - authoritative. not based on birth.
                            based on level of consiousness. Not forbidden but as per consciousness - they don't see things that way.
                            Maths in standard 3 not allowed to read triple integration calculus - not allowed, discrimination - no, you won't understand.
                            There is progression. Productivity is more for some people. Not permanent but gotta grow like other fields.
                        Madhyama - my interactions affect and reflect my consciousness.
                            Hanuman angry when Rama criticized by Ravan - didn't say I gotta be calm and undisturbed.
                            Not affected may mean that my relp with Krishna is superficial.
                            repr of Krishna - demigods and not independent supremes
                        Kanishtha - aware about other spiritual teachers attractions.
                            other conceptions also - but chanting HN is important.
                        Not that we start categorizing people and classifying people into pegion holes.
                            objective principles and don't do subjective judgments.
                        Uttama - means beyond darkness.
                            SP explains down to earth ways but not lofty ways.
                            art of understanding shastra - quote wars. Understand shastras in their completeness and contexts.
                            NOD explains lofty characteristics also.
                            may criticize but doesn't love to but needs to.
                            stupor of person - jolt with strong words but even PM but not spiritual vision, so give material vision with strong words.
                                meets them with kindness - strong with disciples break glamor in disciples' mind but meeting them SP must elevate them.
                            Doesn't mean white wash everything - @doctor caring attitude to e1 but doesn't say e1 is healthy ignorantly.
                            Kanishtha sees body, madhyama sees both body and soul and moves to soul, uttama sees eth but prime spiritual focus.
                            For new ppl to see criticisms even in family is devastating and damaging to see.
                            Focus - Temple, PD, college preaching, VA, etc - not e1 should abide by 1 thing. Make spiritual advancement in that.
                                Scientific inclination then defeat misconceptions like atheism and darwinism, etc. But not e1 has to do it.
                            Intiating - very advanced can intiate and more terrain and can guide - limited by SM's advancement and that's not static.
                                Prabhupada - why usurping title. Disciples could leave. And see my letterhead - nowhere prabhupada. My disciples want.
                                I have inherited legacy of spiritual master - who has written books, made more devs and temples - bragging no it's true told to disciples.
                                desire to serve SM and Krishna.
                                So SP clarified but never disrespectful. Don't associate with them if polluting disciples minds.
                                    not envious but protect disciples. Where did he go? BTG - my SM is very powerful.
                            SP - st I criticized some devs plz forgive me in gaudiya matha - you are not patita but patita pavan.
                            Title: Associating Carefully with advanced devotees.
                            Uttama - true leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way is mahabhagvat.
                                SP - carefully protected by his father and SM.
                                descended - in some intimate disciples but never claimed that as authority for preaching.
                                fulfilling prophecy of LCM is responsibility of parampara.
                                BSS very ill and said who will do it - SP said some fool will do it. Rationally it's not possible but beyond logic faith - it's not mission impossible but mission unstoppable.
                                Keep taking 1 step at a time and way will be made.
                                LCM's words - so 7 will do it - no, it's our responsibility - Arjuna didn't say Krishna you fight and I will take bhang (caricature of swindlers).
                                SP worked harder than anyone else - empowered but obstacles - SP went on like 2 arrows coming colliding head on.
                                    cultist and persecutions and illegal some places, etc.
                                cultural upbringing - radical differences but Rath yatra and give and ask for charity.
                                    Life membership in India - prayojan kept same but abhidhyeya as per TPC.
                                    @SAP - car - see envy in neighbor's eyes
                                        sambandha - knowledge, Abhidhyeya - bhakti and prayojan - prema - says CC.
                                        prayojan - anticlimax in material life - car bought and neighbor has better car.
                                        Lift stops in with 2 inside and current on touch; family troubles abhidhyeya; Lived happily ever after but doesn't happen cuz duhkhalayam ashashvatam.
                                Mumbai big balloon and e1 could see Hare Krishna in sky.
                                Jubilant in PD's association like Peacock spread wings seeing cloud.
                            Is preaching success sign of spiritual advancement?
                                Yes, provided it is a result of not a substitute for, inner fulfillment.
                                sick - cure is found then wants to share it.
                                soul is sat cit ananda but can't with identification with body which is asat acit nirananda.
                                Krishna becoming a tool for external validation and fulfillment but inner satisfaction is lacking - I made them devs - repr of God I am.
                                It is sign of spiritual danger - self worth. Material world also could have it all.
                                Book distribution scores so external success matters but SP said what pleases me most is when you love Krishna.
                                But don't judge others with external success or shortcoming.
                                Preaching removes misconceptions and ignorance - 1 obstacle but there are other obstacles - like bad culture not suitable.
                                    building culture is great. Cooks cooking prasadam. Pujari dressing is preaching - different devs diff inclinations.
                                    preachers, speakers, writers, community builders, etc.
                                Comes closer to Krishna is greater satisfaction - thorns in my path but joy in removing thorns from others' path.
                                what bring joy is selflessness - sth nobler.
                                Happiness is always a byproduct not core product. Work for happiness it's bored - dedicate to cause higher than ourselves.
                                    material causes also but material so temporary.
                                    removing others' difficulties st put us in difficulties but there's a joy in that.
                            Adhikari types - Faith X knowledge - 11, 10, 00.
                                Madhyama - present scriptures effectively not there. Not just theoretical but applicational knowledge.
                                Basic knowledge that medicine and it works but not enough to become a doctor - madhyama has seen treatment but doesn't know how it works.
                                sharp awareness for what to be applied where.
                                practicality - how to deal with this situation. How to speak with this devotee and that dev and this situ and that context - it takes years.
                                This is my TV, fridge, dog and guru - not showpiece in hall but show pieces in our hearts - under anarthas.
                                Guru is meant to open our eyes.
                                Not specific problems - of course, they can help but mainly root cause problem and not symptoms.
                                In material world, loose ends never end. Small things are always there in stock.
                                    we keep fixing these things but also work for spiritual evolution.
                                    deeksha - high standards doesn't mean fanatically strict - mass of ppl don't but still so many - this means higher taste
                                    austere conditions and sharing in those days HK - hostile conditions especially against hinduism in Pakistan but they accepted.
                                HN we chant not for taste but medicine for purification - inability to chant certain rounds means fallen state.
                                    implied that good chanting; talk about so many services but good chanting is implied just like go drive to mountain implies that don't do accident.
                                    HN chanting is promise to SM so understand that this is important.
                                    someone has burden we want to shoulder the burden (not burden the shoulder - so many probs) - SM has burden of KC spreading. 
                                    @just like we ask for bag of burden on their shoulder.
                                    @child carried by mother on shoulder but later grow up no help them.
                T6 : Title : Avoid seeing devotees with material vision
                    Advanced devs especially not to be seen with material vision.
                    low family, bad complexion, deformed, diseased, infirm body.
                    Overview
                        Criticism of bodily defects
                            api cet suduracaro.
                        birth
                            even if not from brahmin or goswami family.
                                who is goswami.
                                    Monopoly of PD - not hereditary rupa and Sanatan.
                                    Non envious and pride less.
                                    Goswami families may criticize
                                        protest goswami title given to american vaishnavas.
                                            not envious of western sanyasis
                                            proud of own birth
                        Material vision
                            Not observe actions of PD from material perspective.
                            Should see how he is serving the Lord.
                            What's the origin of external vision
                                thinks that KC is limited to
                                    Certain section of people.
                                    Certain section of devs.
                                    Certain tract of land.
                        Jealous
                        Disciplinary action
                        To advise
                        to correct
                        The effect : Obstructive and dangerous
                            For KC advancement.
                        More - SP's Godbrothers.
                            Didn't appreciate the extraordinary activities of spreading KC worldwide.
                            Empowered person should not be treated as ordinary human being.
                            CC - Krishna shakti vina nahi.
                    Details
                        why probs - karma - not postmortem but prognosis.
                            not to do is the purpose.
                            Eg - baby is crying - what karma did baby do now or b4.
                            LCM to Sanatan - didn't say karma on boils - not his karma but my dharma.
                            king to home stealing - your karma - no, dharma.
                            gang rape of delhi girl - we should not even be asking this question just like no1 asked for draupadi.
                            if not seen in proper perspective then damaging.
                            don't be judgmental.
                            starve then give food but if material help is incomplete - karmic wrong should also be corrected.
                                @mother caresses child - not completely solved but necessary and not useless.
                            PD probs - ok bad karma but between Krishna and him and I care for my dharma.
                                even if so, api cet suduracar in past now serving Krishna sincerely so consider sadhu.
                                defects are peripheral and core is serving Krishna.
                        PD makes mistakes - asked by Jayadvaita Swami.
                            Shloka quotes wrongly - spiritually no prob.
                            wrong conception of perfection - eth for Krishna - materially there can be.
                            English SP spoke some probs - 1 mistake in book kills it.
                            For every SB books, sackful for proofreading materials - not more than 25 times.
                            1 friend would find mistakes and get some rewards - not in SP books - dev's proofreading.
                            Change the word rather than changing dictionary - SP very practical.
                            SB - even if mistake in every word but cuz glorifying Lord so are accepted and rejoiced by honest ppl.
                            assisting ppl access the message without unnecessary negative perfections about grammar and all. So proofreading of books.
                        @Ganga coming from Vaman's feet.
                            toxic cuz chemicals added - drink then poisoning - just sprinkle.
                            material so material reactions - transcendental potency.
                            Both is problem - Material as eth and don't see spiritual and another problem is see only transcendental at expense of material.
                            presentation is edited not content.
                                Eg - misheard from dictaphone - No triloka vs pitriloka - violence if you don't change it cuz nothing called triloka in vedic cosmology.
                            India so fortune but if it makes them hate mlecchas then not favorable.
                                don't stay obsessed with externals.
                                Eg - Naked pincho Guy - High court judge but what was he - doesn't matter.
                                SP turns the argument of who's goswami - it's monopoly of PD. Cultural and legal point of view is ok.
                            SP - making GBC instead of Gaudiya Math - committee. Is it deviation yes but needs to be seen in completeness.
                                Krishna manifests his will can't be stereotyped - to 1 person. Connection with God and 1 person representing.
                                GBC tried by BSS but didn't work and 1 repr but also didn't work.
                                SP crying alone in wilderness and NY no help from PM although some were close 
                                but later with fame - peripheral members becoming not a core member but the member is difficult to digest.
                                Vrindavan was small place - hometown boy who becomes world famous - pride of village - so celebrations at Vrindavan 
                                    his capabilities in english and business profession - this appreciation is minimization.
                                    to elevate people from most fallen to most advanced.
                                    Without Krishna's power no parivartan - so that needs to identified.
                            entrenched interests - Goswamis etc in power and want to keep it - sadhus but remind them of shortcomings.
                                Haridas Thakur - so many saints that would go unnoticed. Hindus complained to Nawab that contaminated that teaching hinduism to hindus and big city.
                                Nawab impressed by his words but pressure from public.
                                Similarly, Jesus was complained by Jews cuz challenging the rituals of existing times.

                        !Like terrorism, etc.

                            Let's make our intelligence FIT - material enjoyment has -
                                F - Futility - dreams but don't get it. No gulabjamun in feast.
                                I - Insubstantiality - mess of recipe and not good enough.
                                T - Temporality - it's good but gets over - item or my capacity to enjoy it.
                                it's a doom project - lost project - see in flow control graph.
                        Spiritual enjoyment is eternal - soul and supersoul and desire to serve.
                            soul contacts Krishna - doze off if not attentively.
                            soul disconnected with spiritual reality but sleeping into illusory awareness like dream.
                            chanting ain't verbal activity but heart has to be involved.
                            diseased state - that I don't get happiness and it's a place of misery.
                            SING your way to happiness.
                                S - Special - previlige of humans. Practitioners are rare. 
                                    Standout thru fashion but punah punashcarvita charvananam.
                                I - Increasing - doesn't decrease like material. Greater happiness - remember more and more happiness.
                                    ananda ambudhi vardhanam.
                                N - Non-dependent - dependent on external things for enjoyment in material world.
                                    like drugs external. Sports - then team; if with game, then TV and stadium.
                                    externals not in our control.
                                G - Generous - our happiness will make others happy.
                                    taste in KC - shares that and others get inspired and move forward.
                                    sharing reduces but here sharing increases.
                                    so attentive chanting is for others 
                                        not in control of lust anger greed - not hurt ourselves and others 
                                        and ability to share our happiness and reduce their pain para dukha dukhi.
                        How to make Intel > Mind for cure.
                            CC - Conviction - intel and Commitment - heart.
                            Conviction understand that Poison now and nectar later.
                            Commitment - I must chant even if with bad quality - commitment to quantity is impetus to quality.
                            If I am going to chant to spend 2 hrs anyway - better spend properly - inattentive then bored.
                                struggle and get taste is better than bored for rest of life.
                            without chanting the impetus for CC reduces.
                            @ Mother - intel. Child - mind. Doctor - guru. Medicine - HN.
                                Doctor gives guidance to mother but patts and does casual talks with child.
                                SM touches my forehead so I got mercy - take shelter of process that's given. So, that's for mind.
                                mind like child may say I don't want medicine so mother administers properly.

                        Friend
                        Impressions
                        Dangerous

                        Think of Krishna not birth
                    How to Train
                        Reside
                            In Vraja
                            Under shelter of advanced devs
                            Think of Krishna and pastimes
                        Process
                            Remembrance of Krishna and eternal associates.
                            Different stages of remembrance.
                        How to Serve
                            with feeling
                            under direct guidance of a particular associate of Krishna.
                                Sadhana - spiritual practices executed while in stage of bonding.
                                Sadhya - God realization
                Detailed
                    Purpose of ISKCON is training the mind - center life on God is changing the habits so training.
                        Focus of ISKCON is not FFL, etc but train the mind - yoga is to connect - reorientation of mind to connect or inclined to Krishna.  
                        There's demons ppl talk about - player misses a chance, etc - mind, trouble or anxiety - choking under pressure; succumbing to lower pleasures. St overcome us.
                            impressions come up - external tempting objects - we can resist but st impossible to resist.
                            fermentation under water and bubbles come up and contradictory to our spiritual values.
                            law of last thought - great devastation and fear - so we go to where we seek shelter so instinctively mind goes there.
                            Mind can act as enemy so be cautious.
                    Look at the mind b4 you look with the mind. MIND.
                        Meaning - evaluate speaker as he says.
                            Driver can't see proposed hand direction and cautiously. 
                            Is he trustworthy and credible.
                            Mind tells lies and identify its tricks and stay cautious. Don't get trapped.
                            For spiritual goals controlling mind is important even for material like addiction.
                            mind misleads thru these ways life after life so don't take these lightly.
                        M - Magnifies problems
                            thinking of problem doesn't solve the problem.
                            @overcooking rotten vegetable and thinking that it will become good.
                            about it and can solve with calm mind but not with agitated mind.
                            sth can't be changed but a lot can be. Lament, depress, hanker or hope - sucks and saps our energy.
                            tell your problems how big god is and not vv.
                        I - Imagines Pleasures.
                            Fantasy land - day dreaming and go for a trip.
                                @cricket hit on the streets - as if last ball of India pak game and I make winning stroke.
                                pleasures maybe sinful - thoughts contaminate us and momentum may increase.
                            Day dreaming vs vision - vision has action involved. Inspiration and lighthouse for movement.
                                be resourceful. Coming from life priorities.
                                I have got new car and see neighbor has better car. Loan or better win a lottery.
                                Priority to love Krishna.
                                cheerleaders of mind - controller of mind - check it and not dance with mind's proposals.
                        N - Neglects opportunities.
                            present is all that we have and will ever have. Future and past always outta reach 
                                future also eventually becomes pleasure when we act there.
                            future is important or past sth was - no, now matters. Be God conscious in the moment.
                            While HN we think we are not doing seva and while seva we think I am not focussing on chanting HN.
                                path of least resistence - sleeping while reading.
                            focus on what we can't change but can focus on we can and Krishna may make ways for what I can't.
                        D - Denies realities
                            3 ways:
                                Blame Krishna - he is busy with his pastimes. And I struggle.
                                Chanting doesn't work or process isn't powerful enough.
                                I am too fallen that there's no hope. Perverse false ego. True ego is Krishna centered.
                            Avanti Brahmana - all the problem caused by my mind.
                                mind denies ultimate reality that soul suffering in material existence and realm is itself a problem.
                                life is temporary yes but long time.
                            Fear of death should not make us paranoid that bomb anytime and I may die - but raise consciousness from material to spiritual.
                    Go to Vrindavan and do bhakti.
                        make spiritual advancement so need models.
                        absorbed in love for Krishna.
                        This is my svarupa. Mood of service and internalize it to serve in similar ways.
                        Raga marga is very exalted and can't rush there.
                        Krishna has given us process to get esoteric gaudiya mood also.
                            not just remembering RK but in a way that's pleasing to them.
                            Prematurely intimate pastimes then it can degrade us.
                            distinctive characteristics of vrajavasis is far more important - that's what SP gives.
                        Gopis gave up home and went to Krishna 
                            Along those lines, SP travelled ew on instruction of SM - that's selfless sacrifice - the mood of Vrindavan.
                            to internalize that mood which SP exhibited is tremendous advancement.
                            SP is model for whole ISKCON. Thru books and SM also but SM models SP for us.
                            SP giving mercy of LCM and acaryas.
                        Live in Vrindavan - so e1 should live there.
                            trained thru jiva G - go back to Bengal and preach.
                            aghast why - tremendous expansion of Gaudiya.
                            Vraja is not a place but a mood.
                            SP never left vrindavan but carried it in heart
                            can take dev outta vrindavan but not vv.
                            fulfilling LCM's mission is fulfilling his wish and that's vraja.
                            spread mood of vrindavan ew.
                        4 dashas
                            shravan - stage of hearing to move forward.
                            varana - internalize this and assimilate.
                            smarana - meditation.
                            sampatti - perfection of life. Coming to know your svarupa.

                        Just fancy - don't wanna die so eternal world.
                            those same skeptical people love to watch magic school of harry potter and disneyland.
                                what's the observation here is attraction to supernatural is natural.
                                people want sth special - sth not stereotyped - ESMD ew. Want sth new 
                            don't believe in existence of harry potter land.
                                such novels and movies so seriously - all imagination - cuz heart longs for it.
                                Don't know about God - mythology or fancy but create our own fancy and absorb consciousness there.
                                no purification with such fancy.
                            natural attraction should not be suppressed but directed.
                                another imagination which we treat as reality from emotional purposes.
                                rational ppl also delight in this - innate longing in heart
                                doesn't conclusively prove but indicates a possibility.

                                All fundamental needs are provided - another need is knowledge - given thru scriptures.
                                Spiritual world is declared as ultimate destination.
                                Body is dead matter and can't experience anything - matter can't experience matter.
                                Soul has to have a place where it belongs which is eternal - 1 of the same nature.
                                Gold so precious - where does it come from - gold mine. Sth that doesn't belong to its surrounding.
                                Eth around is material so where does soul come from?
                                Lots of scientific research - extreme power but over slice of reality - spectrum visible, etc
                                    parallel universes and scale of perception affects perception a lot - miss world over microscope.
                                    true scientific person knows how much there is to know and how limited we know already - eg - space exists but what all is there to know.
                                There is no spiritual world - no honest scientist will be so dismissive - so huge universe we don't know what all is possible.
                                    we can at least be open minded.
                                    particles discovered were fantasy once.
                        beyond material world is spiritual world which is not destroyed with it.
                            it's 3 times - so spiritual world is infinite or finite.
                            is 1/3 of INFINITY also infinity 
                                set of natural numbers and set of odd numbers - all INFINITY but we can appreciate a difference - same concepts don't apply.
                            Vaikuntha means no kuntha or material problems or suffereings.
                        Hieararchy - in terms of rasa - eth is perfect and happy.

                                    By arrangement of Lord - comes back to bhuloka vrindavan and sadhana for sth else.
                                    why not satisfied when others are - 1 persons rasa can't be imposed on the others.
                                    intimacy and sweetness of pastimes - vishnu doesn't have parental affection rasa
                                    many bests in spiritual world.
                                    gaudiya siddhant - subjective but objective reasoning also. Not eth is same 
                                    we don't have to be insecure when other sampradayas don't accept Radha kunda as highest.
                                    cherish what's given and not impose on others.
                                Mathura - accessible to us - Vaikuntha isn't.
                                    I am where my devs chant my glories - not in vaikuntha or mathura - what those who make there will do and not find him there.
                                        join associations of them and Krishna becomes accessible thru associations.
                                    What's dham exactly - sewages and hogs and looks filled with dust and commercialized.
                                        Dham can be perceived as per adhikar.
                                        @Universe is like a big mainframe computer with different levels of access to different users based on adhikar.
                                        admin and users - user doesn't see some part of computer - exists but can't see it.
                                        whole of existence is like that - material consciousness we see material conscoiusness so spiritual exists but is unmanifest to us.
                                        spiritual perception activated then we can see.
                                        how can we see dhama? Integrate the following
                                            Scriptural description with
                                            sensory perception and pray for 
                                            spiritual revelation.
                                            More - 
                                                potency is there even if we can't see it.
                                                we go to temple to be seen by lord and not to see.
                                                More than sensory perception it is mainly service.
                                        revelations are made like to LCM - conquer the heart and fortune. Even jahnava devi.
                                            Dham is covered by yoga maya says BVT. And mercy of Krishna thru devs.
                                Vrindavan
                                    taken away from mathura - lived in there.
                                    and very intimate pastimes - all 5 rasas manifested there.
                                Govardhan - tended cows and meeting places.
                                    in this pastime, many rasa simultaneously - friendly, parental and conjugal all at once.
                                    intimate service to all jivas.
                                    gopis exalt govardhan and service of so many services.
                                        caves, trees, fruits, cows grazing, etc.
                                Radha Kunda - foot of govardhan. LCM discovered.
                                    by passage of time things go down - wonderful pastimes there.
                                    Vristasur and intimate pastimes - manifestations of love for each other.
                                    pastimes is exalted - Krishna killed him and you killed cow no that's sinful still.
                                    How to atone - bathe in all rivers - summoned all of them there so bathe here.
                                    you sided demon so contaminated now so take bath - so bangles to make trench and fill from yamuna 
                                        take water from here - no contaminated.
                                        laborious work - rivers said allow us to serve Radharani allowed so intimate love manifestation.
                                        can't understand Radha's love cuz Krishna can't understand so comes as LCM.
                                        Radha also god only but manifested as devotee for pastimes and opportunity for us to love and serve.
                                    SP took disciples to places of pilgrimage so treat is respect and reverentially.
                                        frivilous bathing - don't bathe - not permanently - purify and not grats.
                                        mood of selfless service - bathing also important.
                                    Not practical and may take cheaply and commit aparadh also.
                                        SP and teachers told us so stay in heart. Have mood of selfless service.

                            Jnanis -

                                Know fruitive activities bind

                                PD - Develop Pure Love of Godhead like Narada Sanaka and sanatan.
                            Gopis
                                Only know satisfying Krishna.
                                Expect no return from Krishna
                                Cannot Forget Krishna
                                    Vipralambha seva - mood of separation
                                        Mood of LCM.
                                        Better than serving directly.
                                Most exalted of all devotees.
                            Shrimati Radharani
                                Highest of all gopis
                                cannot be excelled
                                Krishna can't understand her    
                                    came as LCM.
                                Radha Kund
                                    Radharani's lake
                                    Most exalted place - Laghu Bhagavatamrita
                                    serious devotee must take shelter - execute service there.
                        Detailed
                            More - this hierarchy is pyramidal - numbers keep reducing as we go up the pyramid.
                            Vikarmis included although not in shloka cuz in past karmis was at least there.
                            Scriptures guidelines not restriction but protection
                                @Mother's embrace isn't restriction but protection.
                                Guidance that you can fall from roof.
                            Laws that we are not able to decipher - discovering things at every level.
                                matter follows laws but strange that we don't think consciousness is governed under laws.
                                Gravity works whether scientist or not.
                                precise governing phenomena not able to understood - even matter not completely forget consciousness.
                                laws governing consciousness from scriptures - not frozen text but living text in hearts of practitioners.
                                What applies in current context is known to acaryas.
                                harmonize with laws of nature is the goal else we hurt ourselves.
                                reject scriptures - BG 16 - nth to regulate desires - no perfection, happiness or ultimate destination.
                                So at least become karmis - to align with principles.
                            focus on material enjoyment but getting it in lines of dharma - not gonna sin and gradual elevation.
                                meeting spiritual and material needs.
                                VA is systematic arrangement for ppl to live spiritually.
                                only religious example - comprehensive social model for facilitating spiritual journey.
                                Hinduism offshoot of vedic culture.
                                Religion - have say about social conduct but such massive social scale of implementation ain't easy.
                                PD excepting eth is undesirable but there are levels - KK should be respective.
                                VA is arrangement for spiritual and material fulfillment.
                                grains - we work for it but also higher arrangement also required.
                                impersonal mechanical forces - lord with agents coordinating material arrangements.
                                supervision of SPOG is requested by KK.
                            Jnanis - not many seek moksha.
                                few focus on that - exploring seriously.
                                aham brahmaasmi - realization thru saying.
                            Bhaktas - very few in number and that may cause concern but difficult.
                            Gopis - don't think of them as women.
                                may have female forms - reduce trans relp to mundane levels.
                                we are not these bodies - whether god is male or female? we are neither male nor female - soul is trans-gender.
                                    Lord is enjoyer and prakriti is enjoyed not literally gender sense. More of a relatable.
                                free from bodily sense is currently required.
                                lord manifest as many ways - Lord as angry brahmin, boar lifting earth, etc.
                                    Kunti M - regal and gentle woman and 6th canto Vritrasur - sweet prayers but his looks and acts - dangerous - roaring - crushing demigods under feet.
                                    SB takes us to go to substance - Like lord, bhakta also takes many forms.
                                    different relp - hierarchies - highest is beloved gopis - lord and devs after reading SB.
                                    Gopis are same gopis - mind, soul, intel eth is same. Female form is best suited for service - that form is taken.
                                Rupa G was sanyasi - gave up eth and mad in loving RK.
                                exalted and should not mistake as humanly love.
                            Radharani is considered highest.
                                her intensity of love - other gopis start trembling.
                                what you have done, I can't repay you.
                                He sees e1 but they not able to see in Rasa lila - see Krishna but 4 arms so vishnu.
                                Love for Krishna is so great - greatest appointment to see Vishnu but disappointed - bow down and ask where Krishna is.
                                Radharani asking frantically - Vishnu wants to point finger but his hands melts.
                                Lakshmi austerity to enter rasa lila but not allowed.
                                She is goddess of fortune and bewilders even Krishna - madan mohan mohini.
                                    madan - sarva dharman parityajya mayam ekam shranam vraja.
                                Vipralambha - will I attain Krishna - anxiety - then union - joy is also far greater.
                                Padyavali - compilation of vaishnavas - radharani feels - separation is higher than seeing Krishna - Krishna is seen everywhere.
                                    humility and remembrance is higher and hankering rises. LCM comes to taste that.
                                @Mother sees shoes and remembers the baby - stimuli triggers love.
                                    uddipan - neTh that deepens love.
                                    Vrindavan is full of such triggers. Radha Kund is such trigger - manifestation of her love for Krishna in liquified form.
                    T11 - How love reigns supreme in Goloka Vrindavan.
                        difficult to attain but once bathing.
                        kunda is dear to her. rarely to attain.
                        Pure love for Krishna aroused by bathing once in that.
                        Overview - Serving Radha Kund
                            Why Radha Kunda?
                                Belongs to radha - most beloved gopi.
                                As dear to Krishna as radha herself.
                                Unlimited glories

                        Detailed
                            ata krishna namadi - serve Krishna with tongue - can't perceive spiritual when presents itself - so need to clean.
                                sevonmukha - Krishna reveals himself.
                            Just going to place Radha Kunda is enough - no!
                                stay and can't control senses and immoral acts - narak kund - disastrous results - at holy place is worse 
                                    and while pretending to be saint is worst. 
                                Montrously grave - consequences it will have but we wanna please Krishna.
                                Upanishad approach is focus on spirit - rejection of matter.
                                Bhakti is use matter for spirit - a danger that all matter can't be engaged in spirit - detachment then yukta.
                                Tantra tradition - right hand tantra - deity worship vs left hand - tamo guna - inauspicious - any matter in Krishna's service.
                                    eth is dance of matter and spirit.
                                    creation is dance of shiva and shakti - so let's have sex.
                                    when we rasa lila - Krishna and gopis enter into them and trans dance - this is rascal lila said SP.
                                    Children - devotionally cultured and trained - inclined - having fun and all same genders.
                                        aesthetically done in vraja but aratis of RK actors - and SP didn't like it and said stop such plays - can take in wrong direction.
                                SP stopped Radha Kunda bath temporarily.
                                    purports - universal and given thought and time.
                                    Lectures - contextual to audience.
                                    Talks to ppl.
                                    Letter to person.
                                    This hierarchy is understood by all scholars in ISKCON and vedabase.
                                    don't use 1 place to contradict that SP says in other place.
                                    @1 principle not important - even law - killing is murder but army soldier and fight - then reward or protection or self defence or chastity protection.
                                        real life - not 1:1 but many circumstances and other factors come into picture.
                                        other factors to be considered in law.
                                Rupa G talks about Radha Kunda in text 11 and why were other texts required anyway.
                                    it's climax of book - other principles also apply that's why.
                                    promises are not exaggeration - but can't use them for bargaining chips.
                                    anti-thetical to DS to demand - begging attitude with purification process to attain it.
                                Madhurya bhakti - how is it different from lust in material world.
                                    devotional interactions not sensual interactions.
                                    neTh in material world is perverted reflection of spiritual world.
                                    Male female attraction is dangerous in all religions - but where does it come from is not explained.
                                        keep it in regulation thru marriage but no explanation.
                                        splendor of Vedic - it is told in fullness - RK duhi deha dhari - for purpose of reciprocating love.
                                            not incompleteness so expanded but to share his completeness.
                                            why does god do anything at all? Greek philosopher - frozen perfection. painting comes up - zenith its beautiful - 1 dab less or more is perfect.
                                            act to want something - doing sth will make him imperfect - so frozen perfect - theoretically correct but practically unsound and unattractive.
                                            perfect pose for eternity
                                            Love at sight and forget eth in world.
                                            Krishna acts to share completeness of love and not cuz of some incompleteness.
                                            plays is for enjoyment - play not for some purpose - na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate.
                                            Play is done to enjoy - not need to do get joy like play. Better analogy is dancing - flooded with joy so starts to dance.
                                            dancing is not for purpose of joy but result of happiness.
                                            Krishna is atmaram. Krishna manifest as Radharani in female form.
                                            Krishna forgets divinity for love and so do gopis.
                                            They forget eth for climax of lila.
                                        good eating mango not to be eaten - why?
                                            this is shadow - breaking head better eat from that branch.
                                            We like male female attraction and no - why! That reality and this is reflection.
                                    vs Sita Ram, Lakshmi Narayan, etc.
                                        RK is highest - parakiya vs svakiya.
                                        eth is subordinated - love is more exciting and fascinating and captivating when there are obstacles.
                                        within drama is paramours but spouses in reality - RK is like that. Illicit in play alone.
                                        Not united by wed lock looks like - hightens the excitement - for sake of god eth should be given up.
                                        sin should be given up for God.
                                        giving up bad for god is 1 thing but giving up good for god - not descend to bad but above good to godly.
                                        transcends morality for sake of devotion - sarva dharman parityajna.
                                        Gopis love for Krishna demonstrates - chastity - given up for Krishna - actually they don't cuz dedicated for Krishna alone.
                                            Krishna also renounces his divinity for love to reign supreme.
                                        Obstacles to love - not antithetical forces exist but purpose is to intensify.
                                            @elephant pulls and external expression and internal realization that tree shakes.
                                            love is so great when we see that - external expression thru pastimes and internal realization.

                    even other verses recitation give purification
            Krishna's purpose of speaking is establishing Sadhya and Sadhana.

                    means of bhakti is best is analysed.
                    1st chapter creates vi-yoga (not physical but emotions, connections, retentions) - Arjuna overwhelmed by grief and apprehensions - bodily conceptions - clarity of purpose of lost.
                    they become 1 in the end (connection of purpose) - is illusion gone? karishye vacanam tava.

                                        MB is conversation between Janmajeya (son of Parikshit) and Vishvampayana rishi.
                                        Sanjay Dhritarashtra - only sight when Krishna gave vishvaroop darshan
                                                4 generations fighting, 5 generations detailed
                                                        Satyavati, Shantanu attracted to fisherwoman - he was attracted to ganga - 7 sons sent to heaven; 8 was Bhisma.
                                                                Parashar Muni special soul to appear - no compromise on chastity - arrangement for special soul to appear - Vyasadev appeared.
                                                        Chitrangada, Vichitravirya, Bhisma - Vyasadev in same line united with wives of them
                                                        Dhritarashtra, Pandu, Vidur
                                                        Pandavas, Kauravas
                                                        Abhimanyu, and Draupadeyas
                                                mystic television
                                                        much in universe science hasn't figured out - immensity brings humility
                                                        anything that contradicts current conceptions is immediately called imaginary.
                                                        this attitude is arrogance and contrary to human progress. Dismissing vs what could be possible.
                                                        stary experiment - 7 seeing - I become conscious. Different ppl have different degrees - how it happens
                                                        body has eyes, mind has senses - subtle vision, mind is not restricted by time and space like gross matter.
                                                        yoga sadhana can help people perceive things and blessings of great souls also - God's power thru person.
                                                        not aware of 1 part of field but whole of it
                                                        it's scientific in sense of systematic body of knowledge
                                                Hoping for impossible and fearing the inevitable
                                                        assembled to fight - what happened? 1.1b anti to 1.1d and reason being 1.1a
                                                        @after sat for prasad what happened? They ate it
                                                                indicates that expected pattern of events may not take place
                                                        it is pious and dharma place - vibes there affect mind in certain ways
                                                                Eg - temple - even materialists atmosphere is different - don't attribute that to deity but some mystical or aesthetics
                                                                where lord's presence was there or invoked
                                                                Kurukshetra declared as pious place in vedas and parshuram penance

                                                        Dhritarashtra saying that I don't want fight but obstinate son
                                                                he is king - can stop fight.
                                                                To shanti Doot Krishna - I am helpless - Krishna,"do you all listen emperor of world helpless" - cuz of attachment made powerful powerless - can't make right decisions
                                                                internally he has soft corner - I could not - my sons should become king. 
                                                        Dharma Kshetra - field to harvest dharma

                                                                weeds will be uprooted - adharma will be removed - he knows and fearful
                                                        partisan mindset of dhritarashtra

                                                        this is a meaning packed verse - what did they do
                                                                answered in last verse of BG - where there is Arjuna and Krishna - there is victory
                                                army surely victorious - Duryodhana
                                                        I have defeated so many times - once again.
                                                        raja spoke sanjay - king but also one who is good at rajaniti.
                                                                his political skills will become evident in following verses
                                                                no duryodhan uvaca but abravit in previous shloka implies that
                                                        duryodhan goes to Drona to point out a defect not bhisma (Commander)
                                                                dhristadyumna - birth invoked with intent to kill drona.
                                                                full grown dhristadyumna and dark-complexioned beautiful Draupadi.
                                                                why trained enemy - to invoke the anger of teacher - not sure of their support

                                                                Arjuna vs Karna and himself vs Bhima - formidable others like them on their side
                                                        inflate the fighting spirit in our side
                                                                glorify enemy too much then afraid
                                                                tell about others to motivate addressing him as best of brahmanas
                                                Lecture title 7-14 Karna absent yet present in battlefield
                                                8 - power on his side
                                                        strength of forces - whose name first - praise someone else is taken as snub.
                                                        Bhisma won't mind if Drona's name first - brahmana!
                                                        But agitate Bhisma to fight. Karna's name mentioned though not on field but on his mind
                                                        He is convinced of Karna's commitment but Karna mentioned by Bhisma in lower ranks - all encounters Arjuna bested you
                                                        people think Karna killed deviously else no hope to defeat - but reality of all confrontations.
                                                                Martial exhibition Arjuna bested and Duryodhan burnt, I can do eth Arjuna has done - Duryodhan cud use the person.
                                                                        quality for varna and can deer give birth to lion - kindness shown to karna but using him!
                                                                Drona's behest Drupada arrested by Pandavas not Kauravas which included Karna and brought humiliating but appreciated Arjuna so wanted as son in law.
                                                                face off in Draupadi Svayamvar - e1 attacked Arjuna - again they defeated e1 else. Karna - Are you some God? no servant of my guru.
                                                                flaunt wealth to exiled pandavas - lake across for burning envy = ladies on hostage
                                                                Bhima - destiny is favorable - fight comes to us - no we are 105 and insult if ladies taken hostage.
                                                                        what greater joy than show mercy on enemy!! Bhima agreed.
                                                                        Gandharvas defeated Karna and Arjuna defeated Gandharvas so Arjuna's power was greater.
                                                                Virat yuddha - brihannala and all kauravas army - Arjuna defeated all of them including army.
                                                                !Commander Bhisma for 10 days, Drona for 5 days, Karna for 2 days, shalya for last day, ashvatthama for last night - unethical strategy to kill
                                                                Karna chariot on ground - don't entertain thoughts cherished by cowards let me get out and then fight - bow down
                                                                        Krishna said surprising you remember morality and ask arjuna to follow them - where was morality in 
                                                                                asking Draupadi to be brought to court and disrobed
                                                                                shakuni's gambling match

                                                                                killed 16 year old Abhimanyu - with all 5 of maharathas
                                                                                Arjuna will show the same morality today and kill you
                                                                        Arjuna could have defeated him in fair fight but demonstation of shatho shathyam - cunning with cunning 
                                                                        don't sacrifice bigger morality in name of smaller morality.
                                                                                this lesson for forgotten in subsequent history leading to consequences
                                                                                muslims attacks with cow herd in front of them - Hindu warrior how can we kill them so won't shoot back and get slaughtered.
                                                                                or across river - cow flesh in the river - how can we drink it - they become weak and over powered - shatho shathyam
                                                                                intoxication, gambling, womanizing and hunting - madden/ inebriates a kshatriya; such things should not be taken seriously.
                                                                                Vikarna's logic in asat sabha - draupadi should be spared and return kingdom cuz in maddening effect of gambling person should not be taken seriously.
                                                                                MB teaches morality which is lofty but practical - be cunning with the cunning was demonstrated by Krishna.
                                                                                Krishna tried to stop war - his best but if not then do the needful.
                                                        now karna has lost his kavach - armor made him indefeatable
                                                                all players play but India won world cup under the captaincy of so and so.
                                                                as long as bhisma is on battlefield I won't fight said Karna.
                                                                Duryodhan needed both of them - in dielemma - thinking bhisma wins victory then good else karna will surely come.
                                                                if karna now and wounded then bhisma won't come back being old
                                                        bhisma - I know I spoke strongly against you - you are a formidable warrior 
                                                                but spoke so - I wanted to stop duryodhan to stop war cuz of his confidence in you.
                                                                !give him up now - how can I? Karna was heroic and tragic figure from MB - charitable, dharma for surya, powerful warrior but spoilt by bad association.
                                                                !7 helps - we should help them back but doesn't mean joining them in their immorality
                                                                Karna I now feel sorry for provoking duryodhan ragarding draupadi - I did that to please duryodhan.
                                                                in bad association, we may not like but crack vulgar jokes and speak certain words 
                                                                        cuz wanna feel respected and accepted in that association
                                                        Krishna met karna - you are elder you can become king - worldly glory and be a king and dharma also - fighting on side of adharma
                                                                saw duryodhan in dream with head shaven - dishonor - dressed in black and driven by donkeys.
                                                                dices boomerang as bows from arjuna but how can I be unfaithful to a friend in need - cuz of me duryodhan has decided to fight a war.
                                                                I may die but won't give him up
                                                                adorable to lay down life for friend but who is the friend - personification of adharma supporting makes you adharmic
                                                                        the kingdom belonged to pandavas but different jugglery of events
                                                                        and ultimate point of view - eth belongs to lord 
                                                                                if he asks you do sth you do it. He gives things to different people and 1 of them gives sth to us.
                                                                !karna had understanding of dharma but understanding wasn't deep enough.
                                                                Krishna tried to seduce karna so that he would come on his side - superficial understanding - Krishna is everyone's well wisher.
                                                                        war becomes less violent if karna doesn't participate - Krishna embraced and said we meet on battlefield.
                                                        Kripa always victorious
                                                                Yudhisthir sought blessings - he bowed down to bhisma, Drona, Kripa and Shalya (fatherly figure - brother of madri - step mother)
                                                                How will we defeat you he asks bhisma - I will tell when right time comes
                                                                Drona same question - hear disagreeable news from trustworthy source then lay down arms - while fighting no1 can defeat me.
                                                                Kripa - I am indefeatable ; knowing this go and attain victory. He didn't know mystic weapons but long life.
                                                                        he, ashvatthama and kritavarman (yadav - fought against pandavas;choosing krishna vs his energies; Balaram said won't fight)
                                                                        Satyaki also fought - further training from Arjuna after Drona.
                                                                        Vikarna wasn't as formidable - Bhurishrava was - stopped Arjuna from reaching Jayadrath.
                                                        doesn't mention Duhshasana - no doubt about their commitment - only kaurava to oppose was vikarna - so mentions his name.
                                                9 - past tense - sarasvati speaks thru him - they have sacrificed their life for me
                                                        by siding adharma - they are going to be defeated.
                                                10 - aparyapta - immeasurable vs not adequate (negator or intensifier prefix b4 describer) - sarasvati devi - what intends to say and what ends up saying.
                                                        bhisma is far more expert, experienced and learned than bhima - fig in front - 
                                                        zeal to fight 
                                                                bhisma's heart is not in war only circumstancial but 
                                                                bhima since disrobing and vanavas only intensifier with fury.
                                                                that way bhisma's role ain't enough - you others are also reqd.
                                                        contradiction in acharya - focus is different so analysis - tattva vs lila.
                                                11 - all of you must give protection to bhisma - respectful address - attack at strategic points. Bhisma may not pay attention to eth.
                                                        getting e1 involved - impressive character duryodhan is - so thoughtful !!
                                                                calibre ain't in excellence of speech but also purity of motives.
                                                                his motives ain't pure - greed, anger, etc - incarnation of kali to accelerate process.
                                                                thinking is good but what's his heart - @jewel decorating the serpent. attractive but dangerous.
                                                                expertize of 7 materialists - we may put guards down - admirable and may get contaminated.
                                                                expertize in word jugglery (shabd chaplyam) is 1 sign of kali yuga - sign of scholarship.
                                                12 - bhisma hears but thinks we are here to fight and blows conchshell giving duryodhan joy.
                                                        now he is eager to fight so joyous.
                                                        generation of grandfather - although didn't marry.
                                                        life of sacrifice - royal opulence and material pleasure and kshatriya women are beautiful - impossible to remain celibate but enormous willpower.
                                                                BG says stay away from worldly association and go to secluded place to advance of KC.
                                                                son of daughter should become king - shantanu torn between attraction to shatyavati and commitment to Devavrata.
                                                                ok i won't be king - what of your sons? won't marry and as long as alive will protect king of kuru dynasty - had not conceived of spineless Dhritarashtra then!!
                                                                        so ended up fighting on the side of Duryodhan.
                                                                        He says I am conquered by money - external reasons but internal is that Lord wanted so - how powerful a person be if on adharma, he gets destroyed.
                                                                        power so much that defeated armies for wives of vichitravirya and chitrangada.
                                                                        Fought with his guru for 21 days who wiped 21 generations of kshatriyas and practically defeated him.
                                                                        this thankless task of being misunderstood for time to come was taken by him. instrument for lord's lesson.
                                                                father should arrange for marriage of son not vice versa 
                                                                        Lord's pastimes are going to happen so higher plan also not material.
                                                                                not entirely transcendence but not completely mundane also.
                                                                        also kshatriyas can marry many women - polygamy was accepted in vedic culture for several reasons
                                                                                women must marry - can be brahmacharini in spirit - not external ashrama but brahma charati iti brahmachari.
                                                                                small but significant ppl would take to renounce order therefore #women > #men.
                                                                                not punyavaan society then #women > #men.
                                                                        not that e1 should have > 1 but only that who could maintain them - treated properly, cared for - kshatriyas could.
                                                                                SP said we shouldn't accept it - not practical now - not to complicate material life more and more.
                                                        bhisma blew thinking that let lord protect his devotees - I should fight now - enough politicking business.
                                                13 - e1 started blowing - war but in heroic sporting spirit!
                                                        all have skills - let's see who wins - death also gives auspicious destination in future.
                                                        back up staff for drums, trumpets - tumultuous sound ew.
                                        Arjuna Krishna
                                                14 - Krishna enters BG.
                                                        mentality of duryodhan - krishna not fighting then no need talk about him!
                                                        calculation of godless materialists - material thinking and not role that Krishna will play.
                                                        movie hero entry - damsel in distress or abuse - hero comes in fast car screeching tyres.
                                                        even b4 chariot warrior, the name of charioteer is mentioned.
                                                                madhav - husband of goddess of fortune - his side wins.
                                                                pandava - arjuna
                                                                transcendental conch - 
                                                                        Lord's paraphernalia is transcendental
                                                                        Arjuna's PD; intent is transcendental so conch also so.
                        (15-25 lecture called Bhima's herculean appetite and strength)
                        </PreparationForWar>
                        <SignsOfVictory>
                        14-20 Signs of Victory
                                15 - bhima like giant so was his paraphernalia
                                        herculus - giant strength - derivatives from vedic thoughts.
                                                Socrates consoles friends on soul same as 2nd BG.
                                                People settled in various parts but weaker hastinapur - connection with parent culture grew weaker and local derivatives appear.
                                        voracious eater - power doesn't come from thin air
                                                I've brought special gift for you - whatever it is share with brothers - my words have never been false. Vyasdev explains her previous boon from shiva.
                                                Kunti trained Draupadi - 2 parts and 1 part in 6 and other for Bhima.
                                                all of you sit on the shoulders when tired after varnavarta - energetic.
                                                I eat less and other more - not that other person is less sense controlled - our favorite we may eat more also.
                                                if a person eats more on a regular basis and not tongue based then the person is not lack of sense control.
                                                we know Raghunath G who ate once in 3 days and Bhima on other hand.
                                        Brother in law can impregnate in necessary conditions and not considered his child
                                                so Vyasadev impregnated but not his children - they don't refer to him as Vyasadev.
                                                modern times it sounds scandalous - but in past, sex has been part of culture but now it's predominant - continuing dynasty was important then.
                                                nobody considers Vyasadev to be contaminated - one time contact and no more. Still considered as great sage and ladies also no unchaste for it.
                                                Pandavas should refer to Vyasadev as grandfather but rather call him as great sage.
                                        Fasting on ekadashi - bhima says impossible - 1 day you tell me in a year - Vyasadev told to get benefit of all other.
                                        hrishikesha - controller of senses
                                                we are not controller of senses - throat may go bad !!
                                                frequently we do control them but can't always
                                                based on past karma - control is given to us.
                                                hrishikena hrishikesha sevanam.
                                                        my senses are yours - I am meant to be your servant - please engage me in your service.
                                        panchajanya - always his paraphernalia but in lila, there's time when he gets it.
                                        dhananjaya - acquired dhana - Arjuna found dhana in remote area. Also, wealth of spiritual knowledge.
                                16 - 18 - krishna, arjuna, bhima, yudhisthir (sequenced as per influencial in battlefield), then nakul, shalya, shikhandi (amba destined to be cause of bhisma's death)
                                        dhristadyumna, satyaki - undefeatable or cap rajitah - decorated with bow
                                        draupadi sons and abhimanyu - all are powerful
                                19 - tumultuous again described - extending from sky to earth
                                        efffect - hearts shattered of dhritarashtra sons - sheer sound and confidence conveyed thru that
                                        combination of lord and devotees are undefeatable.
                                        all have been signs that victory is gonna belong to pandavas.
                                        expected to win but next verse changes a lot.
                                        courage is not absence of fear but presence of awareness that dwarfs fear.
                                                3 kleshas cause fear - to not fear is ignorance - drunkard may fearlessly enter traffic but stupidity.
                                                fearlessness in ignorance
                                                fearful cuz wanna enjoy here and so dependent - what if this or that goes wrong
                                                fearlessness from knowledge - I am soul not body and Krishna is there. In front of God any problems are insignificant.
                                                        lone road and giant coming with mugging intent => fear but a bigger policeman with gun => fearlessness.
                                                        can't wish fears away - we have to increase our presence of Krishna which dwarfs fear.
                                                kauravas got fear and pandavas didn't cuz no awareness - cuz of siding opposite to Lord.
                                20 - Arjuna starts acting in BG.
                                        The person with monkey flag saw and spoke to hrishikesha - during fight in MB, the monkey on flag seemed real and screaming.
                                        all warriors had distinctive flags for others' recognition
                                        Arjuna's flag was monkey - in MB, on request on Bhima, Hanuman had agreed to enter into that flag.
                                        when pandavas in forest, arjuna in heaven for special weapons - bhima met monkey who humbled him - older brother son of vayu - i seek blessings and request to be present in battlefield.

                        <BhaktaVatsalKrishna>
                        21-26 Krishna as Bhakta Vatsala
                                21 - 6 lines instead of 4 (abcd, abcdef) - split as per continuity of thought.
                                        numbering is changed accordingly. SP focuses on continuity of meaning than technicality of division.
                                        acyuta, place chariot between armies - I can see those came to fight.
                                        e1 knew who all fighting on whose side thru spies. Alliances were also no secret.
                                        e1 warrior fights were planned - what did he exactly want to see?
                                        pandavas always wanted to avoid fight - bhima said to Krishna see if there can be peace - Krishna - in war time, I heard even brave becomes cowardly.
                                                I am not cowardly. I want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.
                                                I also want so but Duryodhan is obstinate and won't listen - Krishna wanted to demonstate my devotees were not instigators of war; tried eth to avoid the war but were left with no alternative.
                                        Arjuna wanted to see how enimical are they; what's their mentality? their disposition.
                                        acyuta - 1 who never falls - 1 who never fails in keeping his promise
                                                Lord is being asked to do which doesn't befit his position - worshipped lord has become charioteer;non-fighting contingent in battlefield.
                                                        for kshatriya to become charioteer is denigration in many ways.
                                                        when karna asks shalya to be charioteer, Duryodhan was shocked..he is formidable warrior - how can you ask him so - I want a match of Krishna.
                                                        shalya was furious - I am king - tell me whom to defeat - I will kill them but this dishonor..especially of 1 not even kshatriya born. I should leave the field and go away.
                                                        @millionaire with many cars and drivers is asked to become driver for another millionaire.
                                                        but Duryodhan skillful - most skillful of all is Keshava and if Keshava has taken that position; no1 who can compete him in that role but you.
                                                                turned whole thing around.
                                                Lord accepted it cuz Arjuna asked it and Lord never fails to keep his promise.
                                                        take me there - are you going to surrender, peace treaty, after conch, they may start shooting to butcher you easily seeing you approach - officially it's started
                                23 - avekshe nirikshe (reference eyes to previous and this verse)
                                24 - Conversation stack reduced by 1.
                                        gudakesh name - 1 meaning is conquered sleep;guda - jaggery, ak - brahma and isha means shiva - that Lord who give jaggery to the demigods.
                                25 - Krishna placed chariot between Bhisma and Drona - the chiefs.
                                        please see (I have fulfilled your desire) - what exactly do you want to see?
                                        there is a great illusion that comes thru eyes - anyone and e1 can get bewildered.
                                        generally in world, maya comes thru eyes and krishna thru ears - too generic blasphemy, deity darshan.
                                                see and pleasure seems readily available - thru sight, Krishna seems far away.
                                                pratyaksha can drag us away from Krishna - have to have our eyes open in the world - but doesn't mean heads and hearts receptive to eth.
                                                discrimination is necessary! Even person like Arjuna can get bewildered if over-realize on pratyaksha - pratyaksha confused him about shabda.
                                26 - Sainya Niriksha Yoga section of chapter 1 ends here and Arjuna Vishad Yoga starts.
                                        get together is joyful experience - difficult in today's time even to get 3 generations together - here we have 5.
                                                this one isn't - mutual destruction plan. Father generation - shalya, bhurishrava, etc. Acharyas - Drona and Kripa (a little)
                                        Duryodhan also had grandfather and Abhimanyu also married and had impregnated uttara.
                                        Ashwatthama - a little envy for Arjuna but friends in Gurukul.
                                        Drupada - father in law - seeing all around - not just kurus.

                                27 - perception shapes emotions - especially vision does strongly 
                                28 - evil minded to serve Duryodhan but now svajanam - they are my people.
                                        Krishna name appears first time - it is an intimate name.
                                        symptoms of emotional breakdown - physical effects coming
                                                throat parching, quivering.
                                        pratyaksha over-reliance has put him into illusion and shabda has taken over
                                                we all need pratyaksha praman - accepted but not all important - praman means valid source of knowledge.
                                                        REL robbing and caught red handed - don't believe pratyaksha is ridiculous.
                                                        seen with eyes be connected with shastra - pratyaksha should assist but subordinate to shabda.
                                                this has uprooted his ground of spiritual knowledge he was situated in.
                                        Ideal response of Arjuna in the illusion is - he consults
                                                vs Kaikeyi - thru ears put in illusion and perception created emotions
                                                        acted on emotions and didn't consult.
                                                        Sensory perception can be misleading.
                                        Not weakness but soft heartedness - characteristic of pure devotees
                                                compassion is a noble emotion - seeing their suffering and they shouldn't and let me do what's needed.
                                29 - hair standing, trembling of body, Gandiva slipping, skin is burning.
                                        emotions are strong we lose control over physical faculties
                                                Eg - in movies, marriage and accident - plate falls from hand.
                                                hair stand on extreme emotions - very happy or scared.
                                                        he is scared not for himself but bloodbath of kurukshetra. Fearful of relatives.
                                                more so in females. for warrior to feel weapon is slipping means emotionally really draining experience.
                                        conveying - how seriously he has been affected.
                                        "due to material conceptions of life" - but Arjuna is PD in previous purport.
                                                shastrik presentation - emphasis is not what's happening but learning what we can learn from situ.
                                                        so orchestration of lord emphasised in last purport and compassion being noble quality. 1 perspective to learn.
                                                        he is coming under yogamaya illusion and acting like conditioned soul - philosophical lessons to learn from there.
                                                anybody can be put into illusion - I should not be put to illusion like this.
                                        purpose of 1st chapter - reasons - demonstrate need for spiritual knowledge and qualification of Arjuna to be a receiver.
                                                bodily conception - eventual bewilderment - well situated I may be but some situ.
                                                qualification - soft hearted, thoughtful, compassionate, submissive.
                                30 - mental affects here.
                                        all unauspicious I see 
                                                signs of disaster - omens / twitching - medical reasons / cosmological factors.
                                                        cosmological, ecological, topological and physiological factors contribute giving karma. omens given thru them that's why
                                                not unable to stay here - mind racing here and there
                                        self centered - 
                                                some situ in life are lose-lose
                                                        whatever decision it's a loss only.
                                                        my good - no good is seen? => why am I here? people run away from the situ or take inapt decisions like quit life.
                                                rise to higher level of thinking 
                                                        God's perspective should be seen - doesn't mean give up our own.
                                                        no1 is interested in supreme self.
                                        The incomprehensive isn't insensible
                                                sth doesn't make sense to me doesn't mean there is no sense in it
                                                        I can't understand with ltd intel.
                                                        there is plan in eth that Krishna does.
                                                                why this? vs how now? attitude to situ.
                                                                we may not get immediate answers like Arjuna got but gradual illumination will come.

                        31-35 Enjoyment
                                31 - 
                                        shreya - long term good. 
                                                party, cricket match all preyas vs career behind college joining - shreyas.
                                                I am not just thinking winning the kingdom but after that. I don't see shreya.
                                        killing relatives - what's pleasure left if they are killed.
                                                yudhisthir remembered - later come to me I will tell how to kill - shikhandi. 
                                                Arjuna said how can I kill him - I would jump his lap saying father - I am father's father.
                                                tendor heart - how can I be the cause - sentiments are good but shouldn't deter you from duty.
                                                vow and responsibility that dharma prevails in the world.
                                                what is the gain? 
                                                        @you can play world cup but in the process, nuclear bomb will destroy whole country.
                                                        you get world cup but no1 to celebrate it with - no family, no fans.
                                32 - 
                                        what we do with the kingdom when those we want to enjoy are on battlefield
                                                ready to give up wealth and life.
                                                        who all will get killed - he enumerates - I don't want to kill them.
                                                        all relatives - they may kill me - but I won't. (?Their greed but I in senses)
                                                vs world cup eg - not sth will happen but you will cause it - why would I do that!!
                                                        analogy may have limitations - not objective exactness but subjective emotions are the point.
                                        personal enjoyment not eternal dharma
                                        Krishna addressed as different names
                                                govinda - protector of senses (or cows - gopal)and pleasure giver.
                                                        serve Krishna supreme delight for senses - beholding supreme beauty vs worldly eyes.
                                                        tongue - pleasure of bragging and delicacies - but glorify Krishna can give far greater.
                                                        how can it be - krishna says give up SG - paradox of bhakti is give up SG - we get greater SG.
                                                        many verses in acaryas - o tongue! glorify the names of Lord.
                                                                Bilvamangal Thakur - worship holy names (chant respectful way)
                                                                        names are sweet but beautiful - eyes vs tongue - beautiful names of Krishna - manifestation permeates all our senses.
                                                                        it is trans-sensory experience - begins with senses but goes beyond. goes to mind - fulfilling that misery goes away.
                                                                        enjoyment after lots of effort => it was all worth it!
                                                                        @a match in stadium - hours watching - team wins? it was all worth it.
                                                                                discomfort is there- crowd, no sleep but joy is so great that feels awesome.
                                                        my senses are aflame - why u putting me in situation where all senses suffering terrible.
                                                                physical misery a devotee may face but Krishna invocation joy - all miseries destroyed.
                                                                krishna will give pleasure by engaging in DS.
                                                madhusudana - 
                                                janardana - protector of people.
                                                        why asking me that will cause people to be destroyed.
                                                        also means destruction of people - well-wisher expressed st by ridding demons of sinful bodies - propensities checked temporarily.
                                                                unlawful behavior in society is also stopped.
                                                names are also opulence of a person
                                                        treasure our name - remembering a person names makes them feel valued.
                                                        which name to use is indicative of the mood.
                                                        @friends - in formal setting formal names but close then nick names.
                                                                names also indicate the state of our relationship and according effect on person.

                        <FearOfSinfulReactions>
                        36-38 Fear of Sinful Reactions
                                36 - sinful acts.
                                        we will take shelter of paap - let it come upon us.
                                        atatayina - those come with stretched bows - aggressors
                                        they are all relatives - svajana.
                                        madhav - husband of laxmi - bestower of fortune
                                                why are you bringing misfortune on me, O lord!
                                                Krishna never brings misfortune to anyone - speak nth of devotees.
                                                we only feel so. Krishna's actions are not always pleasant but benevolent - feels good vs does good.
                                                @Surgeon - removing cancer cells or bodily growth - knife cuts - it is not pleasant but benevolent.
                                                Krishna is cutting here misconceptions and illusions.
                                                we will see this will bring supreme auspiciousness for Arjuna.
                                        6 types of aggressors
                                                poison, fire, weapon attack, rich plunderer, land occupier, wife abducter.
                                                Pandavas suffered all the ways - kauravas were atatayina.
                                                bhima poison..threw in river, varanavarta..they set fire to house b4 assistant of Duryodhan would
                                                Virat yuddha, army attack on forest pandavas - I curse destruction if you do said vyasadev.
                                                gambling match (against codes - who bets plays not shakuni) - if you fear then don't play (yudhisthir saw dhritarashtra no objection)
                                                draupadi vastra haran.
                                                already done bad karma and deserve to be punished. if they are punished - killing them not bad karma.
                                                        that's punishment they deserve.
                                                        kshatriya's duty to kill such a person - already sinful reaction in future life - kshatriya failure to do duty is bad karma.
                                                        aggressors but relative!! relative protection in dharma as per shastra
                                                        kshatriya dharma vs kula dharma (protect dynasty) - he prioritizes kula.
                                                        saintliness of kshatriya is shown in different way - ravan was killed - time for saintliness but law and order establishing is priority - cowardly if not done.
                                                        Lord Rama accepted it when kingdom taken away - not objected. no adharma of harming others - he alone was suffering.
                                                        but when sita attacked - demon terrorist had to be killed
                                                        father's prerogative - let him decide. There he didn't but here did - dharma has to be applied carefully.
                                37-38 - same line is repeated in successive parts - 37c and 38c.
                                        9.34 and 18.65 - man manmana bhav mad bhakto - a and b match - 62% same.
                                                emphasis more on devotee staying committing; later Krishna saying his affection and reassuring protection.
                                        Here repetition is 2 kinds of thoughts for same event - different perceptions.
                                        if you don't kill them, they will kill you being aggressors
                                                their consciousness is abducted by greed, ready to kill relatives
                                                friendly quarrels - there is background to Duryodhana's blindness - as acting king, Dhritarashtra got attached while Pandu in forest.
                                                cuz no indication of Pandu coming back, e1 thought of Duryodhan to be the next king.
                                                as prince, he was pampered, spoiled and every desire fulfilled; grew arrogant, proud, demanding.
                                                king saw the faults but thought he outgrow on becoming king.
                                                        when Pandavas came back after Pandu and Madri gone, they observe pleasant contrast between Pandavas and Kauravas.
                                                        haughty vs humble, sensitivity, demanding vs accomodating, selfish vs selfless, Godless vs Godly.
                                                        soon Pandavas became dear to the courteers and Bhisma also.
                                                        Duryodhan started resenting at this - I was center of attention and future claim to being king also threatened - took this as they are usurping.
                                                                Yudhisthir was senior and also Pandu was the king.
                                                                in this time Duryodhan nursed greed and envy in his heart. experienced only anger and wanted kingdom back.
                                                                he saw them as enemies whose humiliation and destruction became the only goal of his life.
                                                                Many conspiracies and this was final confrontation
                                        they are greedy but we know that those who destroy kula perform sinful actions.
                                                they can't see but we can.
                                                cuz we can see as paap and performing will give reactions more. Why should we do while we see it coming?
                                        suddenly thought from future lives, personal impact to social impact - chaos there also.

                        39-43 Destruction of Family Traditions
                                what legacy we leave - what will happen to society.
                                39 - with dynasty, eternal family traditions will be destroyed and hence irreligion grows
                                        how can that which is eternal be destroyed?
                                                Kula dharma is apara dharma and there is para dharma 
                                                        spouse faithful, parent care children and vv, relatives care - apara duties - not eternal to soul but some obligations gotta be there.
                                                in world dharma and adharma are in conflict - happens in heart, world, universe, all universes.
                                40 - no dharma => women become polluted => Varna Sankara.
                                        Varshneya - coming in Vrishni dynasty.
                                        deep thought - digesting in current ethos.
                                        kshatriyas kill each other => unscrupulous men take power => exploit women => unwanted progeny.
                                                unexpected baby people think. birth control or abortion - not the talk here.
                                                they are talking progeny with poor consciousness, degraded mindsets.
                                                science of how human being is born from embryo. consciousness of baby determined by that of couple at the time of reunion (MMN)
                                                        one musician once said many are born on saturday over bottle of whiskey.
                                                souls are going to be born someway anyway, why not let them?
                                                        @like saying anyway there will be criminals, let them be in my house or city.
                                                        citizen may be exiled, executed - problem is not where they get bodies - e1 be liberated and do good while we are here.
                                                making order in society with people of low consciousness is difficult.
                                        SP purport may be inflammatory from today's standpoint.
                                                women are less intelligent and not trustworthy
                                                        spiritual intel - souls in different bodies.
                                                        material intel - when given career opportunity they grow in so many fields. Toppers they become in schools, colleges.
                                                        it is referring to interactions of soul and body
                                                                intelligence word is used different in different cultures
                                                                        we use it in terms of manipulate, control, organize matter vs IQ score is organize concepts.
                                                                        Vedic time - intelligence - understanding fundamental truths of life - I am not body but soul 
                                                                                generally speaking, bodily misidentification in women's body is far more than male's body.
                                                                                whole sense of self worth and self identity comes from body - how good I look, heads I turn, people I attract - very defining of women's self conception.
                                                                                of course, once person becomes devotee things may change.
                                                                sentimentality > rationality - not bad - women have tendency to practice devotional life easily - bow down to God, etc.
                                                                        sentimentality can lead them to get misguided. Sweet words to them to impress them and then exploit them.
                                                                        rationality is foundational in men - foundation for philosophical enquiry - metaphysical quest/search.
                                                        there is general observations and there are exceptions.

                                                                        subsequent research shows problems with the argument

                                                                                size is dependent on overall body size - male have bigger body.
                                                                                in some cases, women can have bigger brains than males also.
                                                                        Chanakya is quoted not as spiritual authority but moral authority and social purposes.
                                                                                even his words can be fallible cuz he is no incarnation or so.

                                                                                        pratyaksha and anumana unreliable - not always false but they can go wrong.
                                                                                        SP quotes scientific authority of their time which is no longer true.

                                                                men are saying women are less intel - is it true? SP smiled - when you chant HK, it gets bigger.
                                                                is it true? SP not presenting it as serious argument.
                                                                when become devotee, intelligence expands I am not body, I am soul and using metaphysical concepts.
                                                        shastras point is there is a social arrangement where male and female contribute and cooperate and make spiritual advancement.
                                                        unprotected females - not just physical but religous arrangements and applies to e1.
                                                                unstructured time ?/ethos => mind goes to lower activities. This happens to women also.
                                                                social arrangement with facility to practice dharma - it is easy to practice dharma
                                                                        vs temptations all around - tends to drag people down.
                                                                in future, varna sankara - degraded population will come up.
                                41 - such degraded children make life hellish for family and dynasty.
                                        cuz uncultured and uncontrolled so disrupt e1.
                                        Arjuna is thoughtful and can see long term consequences also.
                                        ancestors will fall cuz rituals of offering to family stops.
                                                people who do average punya go to pitriloka (advanced to svargaloka)

                        <CantFight>
                        43-46 - I can't fight
                                43 - janardana (protector of ppl - why allow it to happen) - used repeatedly.
                                        such person who destroy family traditions dwell in hell - i heard in parampara.
                                                Arjuna talking about hell - means he knows soul (continuum) - not entirely unaware of spiritual knowledge or after life.						
                                                his reasoning is based on scriptures 
                                                        not at highest level of scriptures but interim levels.
                                                                based on material conception - just knowing it doesn't purify us, detach mundane and attach Krishna.
                                                                many jihadis - fight, die and go to allah - jannat 73 virgins for eternity - this is distortion of what quran teaches.
                                                                        so doing it not for love of allah but love of virgins - not relationship with allah talked there.
                                                                this is material conception of religion. This-wordly material and other-wordly materialism.

                                                                        no eternal damnation concept in Vedas - in abrahamic religions it is.
                                44 - how sad it is we decided to do all this outta greed for kingdom.
                                        svajana again - frame of thinking has changed - material illusion and bodily thinking.
                                45 - but they won't stop fighting - ok, better die.
                                        if not pratikar - put down weapon - kshatriya shouldn't fight if not equipped.
                                        that's religious warfare. Islam talks of jihad - it's holy warfare and unholy war - protecting religious principles vs personal aggrandizement unholy.
                                        terrorism is completely antithetical to the holy war 
                                                vs kshatriyas fight - equal, equipped and alert. It is taken as sport - let stronger win.
                                                        equal means chariot warrior won't fight with foot soldier.
                                                        alert means shoot from behind
                                                        equipped they be.
                                                terrorism is exact oppose of all of that - not equal, not equipped, not alert.
                                                completely unholy, rather ghastly - ugra karma it is.
                                        getting killed unarmed is for suffering for 1 lifetime - at least sin avoided, and hence long term reactions.
                                                I think that is better.

                                        Arjuna sat down, put aside bow, mind filled with shoka.
                                                BG is historical event but deeper universal significance.
                                                        symbolic meaning isn't wrong if it is not supplanting or replacing literal meaning - supplementing can be done.
                                                                gandiva bow - soul's determination to serve Krishna. But by pratyaksha and anumana he lost his determination.
                                                                see the world, use reasoning - does god exist, care, why serve - do practical things in world. pratyaksha and anumana eats our determination.
                                                SP also says don't worry, you have given reigns of life chariot to Krishna.
                                                        but shabda nourishes our determination.
                                                        that's what will happen to Arjuna - turns to Krishna, Krishna speaks, last verse of BG - yatra partho dhanurdhara (bow is picked up)
                                                                REL (opposite) reading BG, internalizing it - we will get strength and will to serve Krishna will be restored.
                                                        by serving Krishna, my best self interest will be restored. Restored enthu and determination.

                1-10 - Arjuna's further doubts and surrender (confusion state so no aggression)
                        1 - bodily emotions are illusory (focus on body soul difference) - last chapter Arjuna's qualifications
                                compassion for soul is self realization (cultivation - direct tendency is right place)
                                        @coughing - covering vs take to doctor - right direction to compassion - BODD make us feel compassion but direct them rightly.
                                        suffering due to bodily misidentification - immediate causes do need to be dealt with.

                                                        connotation - what it implies.

                                                                salt on wounds - bring her over here - with servants, they can't do just anything
                                                                kshta + trayate - protect others - maid servant but deal with dignity not do whatever they want.
                                                                pratikaman trembled told she aghast - ask assembly if lost first, did he have right to gamble me?
                                                                hofty Duryodhan - tell her to ask questions here - in period in single cloth, I can't come now.
                                                                angry - single or none - she has to come. He is afraid of bhima - duhshasan you go.
                                                                dragged thru hair. hurled on floor - aghast e1
                                                                cultured lady - forgive me in such situation but against my will.
                                                                        mortified pandavas couldn't make eyes meet.
                                                                        how could he gamble me - Bhisma says question is difficult and I am bewildered - wife always belongs to husband.
                                                                        KK perspective - Bhisma seems like in niyama agraha - forgetting purposes of rules - prevent injustices from happening.
                                                                                here injustice at blatant level - technicalities don't matter.
                                                                                Vikarna - say sth else we get contaminated - kshatriya's actions under 4 regs not taken seriously.
                                                                                        annuuled the thing.
                                                                                        karna stops e1 - I have seen many improper things - but this is most inapt.
                                                                                                no1 forced to gamble but voluntarily
                                                                                                no chaste wife will marry 5 husbands - whatever we do to her nth wrong - already unchaste.
                                                                                                angry - duhshasan i cut - I will break your thigh.
                                better to become begger
                                        kill to be worshipped eth tainted with blood
                                        maintaining respect even when acted in greviously wrong ways.
                                        kshatiryas need to administer - forest exile and in cognito were exceptions.
                                        otherwise they live by begging - better that way Arjuna says.
                        6 - final world cup I don't know what's better I win or they? Aye, obvious.
                                situation is complex - lose-lose situ.
                                        fights
                                                wins - killed relatives and can't enjoy tainted with blood.
                                                not wins - loses his life (that possibility not seen)
                                        not fights - living by begging - disgraceful for kshatriya.
                                this is beginning of intelligence - what to do when we don't know what to do - look side doesn't help, look up.
                                        Krishna present in heart and GSS (Guru, Sadhu, Shastra)
                                        frozen by indecision - what should I do? I don't know!!
                        7 - I am weak in response to Krishna you are weak.
                                        perplexities in mat world (what is best to do?) - draining and demanding emotionally
                                                @forest fire - come on their own. surrender to god, sm.
                                so asking what is my duty - my intel is bewildered, deluded consciousness.
                                        I know BG - intellectual knowledge of BG
                                                but true knowledge when turn to do will of Lord. Shastra gives the will and devs reference.
                                        will of lord revealed with time and maturity.
                                                DS => SM manifests as supersoul, other devs repr.
                                brahmana and kripana - seeks for AT vs short sighted.
                                        miserly - attachments on bodily conception => sufferings, lesser focus on God.
                                Arjuna in that situ is will of Lord. 
                        8 - Win war and forget misery or other sages - no other options, Krishna.
                                in anxiety, fluid content reduces.
                                even dream situation (with nature no problem) - heavenly situ - won't dry up the grief.
                                2 dimensional life - spiritual, material (emotional and physical)
                                        physical - roti, kapda, makaan.
                                        emotional - things may be intense - emotional trouble (generational gap, wife, parents, etc)
                                                physical gratification can't solve emotional problem.
                                                hungry - sleep on bed. Eg Chitraketu kingdom but no son @garland to starving man.
                                                wealth can't bring love. 
                                                Love is emotion - emotions between physical and spiritual - emotion for material things and spiritual things.
                                                        emotions with Krishna will lift us out of material world vs other.
                                                        no spiritual perspective in 1st chapter - now or next life but material.
                                                        emotions connected with material => problem vs purification with spiritual.
                                                        So, spiritual solutions to emotional problems! need emotional support, counseling, etc
                                SP tells guru qualifications and probs of life.
                        9 - gudakesh but conquered by other form of ignorance. Hrishesha doesn't.
                                also paran-tapah - he was great person - mat life reveting and entangling that even he is dragged down to knees.
                                uktva twice for b4 and now.
                                Dhritarashtra's smile would be short lived cuz Govinda (hrishikesha)- controller of senses will bring Arjuna's senses in control.
                        10 - in middle of battlefield (dramatic sequence)
                                2.1 lament and 2.2 krishna spoke pep talk . 2.9 lament but enquiry so Krishna instructs.
                                        (laugh off a prob with friends) eg - bhima fearful situ make mighty into cowards - I am not.
                                        e1 wants to give advice - Krishna tells only when asked. when giving classes or books - responsibility.
                                        when guide 7 specifically - interfere - giving help when don't need - unwanted help is interference not assistence.
                                        relationship strains in that situ - walking off cliff and let them - morally obliged to help.
                                        no in 1 to 1 - it backfires - asks for help then give. see response and decide - should i give further suggestions.
                                        communicated decision b4 vs surrendered here. 2.8 tells it's not for namesake - nth else with work.
                                why smiling? ashru purna Arjuna and smiling other person - sympathize vs heartless.
                                        smiling as if - dynamcs of relp has changed - friend has become disciple
                                        Krishna is pleasantly surprised - knows eth but pastimes are so.
                                        7 asks problem and you laugh haha ha - disciple's heart sinks below patal loka.
                                        prahasan iva - like smiling not smiling - he restrains.
                                                Krishna knows what follows will benefit whole humanity.
                </FurtherDoubtsAndSurrender>
                <SankhyaJnana>
                11-30 - Jnana (sankhya) => Fight - as the soul is eternal, compassion for temporary body is ignorant and useless (counters Arjuna's compassion argument)
                        11 - you are lamenting for what's not worthy of lamentation.
                                Krishna calls bluff of Arjuna. Big words (heard in scriptures - hell, sin) - reality is overwhelmed by emotions.
                                education is not for verbalization but transformation - education of emotions is real edu.
                                education - which emotions are real and illusory - relp ain't false - person feels griefstuck - emotions based on platform of false identification.
                                        material reality is actual reality - this is how things are going to be - illusion => knowledge not internalized => no spiritual advancement.
                                        knowledge not internalized so emotions are uneducated.
                                what is life air (asu) - oxygen in medical science.
                                        it's not just oxygen alone - all airs coordinating function of body.
                                        prana vayu - life airs that enable us to function in body.
                                        subtle (emotional) is link between spiritual and material body.
                                                link between subtle body and gross body to some extent is life air (prana)
                                                REL angry => faster breath. stressed => slow breath decreases stress.
                                                emotions agitated so is breath and breath is calmed, emotions also.
                                        pass away - soul goes outta body - life air also goes.
                                                Krishna sucked breast, life air of putana.
                        12 - not a time in past or future, I not exist, you, kings
                                very important in overall message of BG - all eternal beings.
                                Krishna b4 talked about eternality of personality - I U exist in all time.
                                        vs mayavad - In future I dissolves and merges in cosmic consciousness all probs go away.
                                                it's illusory - SO making happy but denying individuality. Eternal individuality is emphasized here.
                                Gita bhashya points are simple shri bhashya is intricate
                                        warrrior on run in shri bhashya so is madhvachrya - brahmasutra bhashya.
                                        SP doesn't go dep here. SP gives strong commentary.
                                        Brahman under illusion - makes e1 thinks person - all merge into cosmic consciousness.
                                                why you existed in past! it's past lives - what abt future - material existence future.
                                                BG is book of enlightenment - mayavadis also accept - so if book of enlightenment then they would go at least Arjuna.
                                        Krishna's statement - never in past, never in future. Individuality is eternal - conventional talk and not philosophical.
                                                REL I am hungry - in day today talk devs don't differentiate my stomach needs food but I am soul.
                                                functional level - devotee is body or soul - our focus is not always focusing - anukul in bhakti it's fine.
                                                        we say you have grown up and don't say your body has grown fat - we don't say.
                                                        Ramanuja hits back - how can it be - see the context, Arjuna was condemned for talking at level of illusion. So, previous verse indicates it ain't casual conventional talk.
                                                                material emotions are condemned and next verse soul you are - and after this also tolerate bodily inconveniences, eternal never ceases to exist.
                                                        philosophical b4 and after - why conventional and casual conversational sense in middle and what it means for Krishna - Krishna is never under illusion.
                                                        mayavadis accept Krishna is never under illusion - brahman has taken a form to speak. I will continue to exist not brahman. 1st person not illusion.
                                        nityo nityananm chetanas chetananam - sober who see him in heart attain eternal peace.
                                                @mayavad - licking honey from outside.
                                                Someone may say - Krishna is also speaking under illusion - then why need to hear from BG. Premise is Krishna enlightened.
                        13 - there is owner of body - body changes thru stages but possessor remains same.
                                #spirituality of individuality
                                #Krishna trying to tell performance of dharma doesn't cause harm, brings ultimate good - surgical cleansing is ok.
                                sober for dhiras - not affected by intoxication (bodily infatuation)
                                such things won't trouble intelligent person - if troubled then person needs to become intelligent. Krishna telling become intel.
                                relatives meet after long time and say you were so small then => there is an unchanging dimension to that person that is addressed by you and changing talked about.
                                        we have changing factors
                                        unchanging factors - 
                                        surgeries for body color, fat removal, cosmetic surgery - they remain same person.
                                        I am not same person - the same I has remained there is sth same.
                                        changed biological level. cells have changed - organs remain same.
                                        if thing is nth more than components - if all components change, is the thing same or different - it is still same and different
                                Krishna talking about changing within life and after life
                                        @laptop old to new - vs 1 by 1 all components changed progressive
                                        incarnation - to come in fless. reincarnation - come in flesh again.
                                                internal reincarnation - gradually change in the body.
                                Krishna says don't get worked up by such a change.
                                        continuity that persists despite the change - what causes that.
                                        in computer usage, changed from old to new - I the user continue to remain the same.
                                        whether computer parts are changed gradually or suddenly - face is user remains same.
                                in reference to previous - when kings didn't exist but they are going to die? yes, sth in body will remain alive.
                                        such changes remain ew - we are worked up by youth to adult - don't get worked up by that - so with external.
                                still I am concerned - no longer with me and I be cause of their death 
                                        yes, so learn tolerance Krishna says.
                        14 - contact senses with sense object (sparsh) - dualities are experienced; tolerate those temporary emotions
                                paradoxical to address Arjuna as Bharat and Kaunteya while previous 3 verses on bodily conception being condemned.
                                        in spiritual sense you can say Kunti is great devotee and Bharat. Identities of dynasty can be spiritual cuz remind you of spiritual.
                                        but other names - purusham purusharishabh - best among men. deha vritam vara - best amongst acquired body.
                                        no, by reference to respectful, honorable references, person feels inspired to act honorably and thus rise, elevate upwards.
                                you should not inflate not pinch the false ego - pat it along the journey.
                                        you belong to great dynasty - now act in a great way.
                                leech - you pull it, it comes along with skin.
                                        gotta tolerate and it comes out automatically - do what's practical but in situ, gotta tolerate.
                                too much of heat, cold - irratable over those help gain nth. Tolerate it.
                                Tolerance seems impotence - you do nth about it - so impotent.
                                        our usage of tolerance is different from what's used in media.
                                        tolerance used in context of religious tolerance - eb has different beliefs and let's not interfere with their way.
                                        what about tolerance when our right to put things first - we take it away from us.
                                        "let things happen the way they are" - keep the biggest battle the biggest battle biggest.
                                                @we get distracted by stuffs - sb cuts us while driving - chase the person to beat is but wastage of time.
                                        ability to insulate ourselves from surroundings enables us to stay protected and focussed.
                                        don't get unduly carried away by them.
                                        Tolerance is not impotence but vigilence to keep energies focussed.
                                                doesn't mean to let others step on us - get others use or exploit.
                                Krishna takes discussion further - fruit of tolerance.
                        15 - can tolerate dualities not bewildered => eternal existence.
                                principle of spiritual life - centered around tolerance.
                                we decide roads based on destinations not appearances of smoothness.
                                where are you going? which ever road looks good - there I will go.
                                don't decide life's priorities by first looks - appearances or feel at first and may not be best indicators.
                                #giving lecture is also a meditation and recall of jnana.
                                talks about fruit of liberation - tolerance => liberation (amritattva, eternal life)
                                don't focus on small things - get to focus on big things.
                                where is the eternity situated is described in the next verse.
                        16 - literary devices or figures of speech - ornaments for appealing aesthetically
                                gita - it is a song - arranged at the time when MB about to take place.
                                texts in some upanishads - gadya and padya. poetry need not be rhyming words 
                                poetry is more esoteric - levels of meaning. It is an art. Pros can also have rhyming.
                                philosophical poem recited by Supreme Lord. Theistic devotional philosophy to be topmost.
                                reciting is purifying and musically enriching. rhyming words, figures of speech are beauty - inversion of first part in second part.
                                        eg - take devotee out of Vrindavan but Vrindavan can't be taken out of devotee - contrasts the first and emphasises the first.
                                                ask not what nation has done for you but vv.
                                Drishtantas - drishti goes to conclusion - essentially 2 natures - material and spiritual.
                                        of the temporary, no existence for long and of eternal no cessation.
                                        paranthesis - put to elaborate further. square bracket to add what's written earlier.
                                                square bracket - qualifies what is being said (clarification), who that "he" is (easy in drama but not in script) - in isolation, put square bracket.
                                        non-existence? but hand exists - SP uses word from temporary context.
                                                wall is an illusion - so walk got a blow in the head - it is like a dream - while in dream, the aspects are real to us.
                                                illusion means temporary - it won't last. Emotionally we get affected by material existence.
                                                illusion is to not see things in connection with Krishna not things themselves. Shloka quoted in reference.
                                                things are illusory but not illusion - caught by world but sth underlying the flow of world. Some move from temporary to eternal.
                        17 - sarvam - no qualifier so is it existence or body?
                                resider of body is indestructive and imperishable.
                                avyaya - no deterioration, avinashi - no destruction.
                                discussion is going on about body - so it can't be existence (which impersonalists uses)
                                pervasion destroys the object thru penetration - atma can't be pervaded by anyone so indestructive.
                                        Eg - bullet, weapon.
                                what pervades? soul radiates energy thru consciousness throughout the body.
                                        sarvam can't refer to existence cuz my consciousness doesn't pervade thru your body.
                                        medicine thru alimenatary cananl and thru blood it spreads ew - similarly does consciousness.
                                1/10K of hair is size of soul - if literal then what's size of tip of hair - is it same for all animals.
                                        it is symbolic of how small soul is - it is symblic - no, soul has dimensions.
                                        not that spiritual world is dimensionless - it has form. RK have heights.
                                        emphasis is not that life is spray of consciousness but particle from which consciousnes is emerging.
                                it's atomic - so can ultra microscope see it? that which is spiritual can't be seen with gross senses.
                                        present in material world in microscopic form - not to say can't see cuz of dimension.
                                5 airs in the body - vectors are there and forces - resultant is zero at a point - that's where atma is located.
                                        prana - thru pranayam - lift consciousness upwards, to spiritual reality - chakras is different - soul is floating in airs - lift that soul (floating in 5 airs) upwards till head.
                                        free from bodily bondage to spiritual destinations.
                                heart is seat of consciousness SP says 
                                        interaction between gross and subtle body - material and spiritual part also.
                                        spiritual is difficult to comprehend for us and explaining mechanism of interaction exists but is system is difficult to explain.
                                        various means thru which it happens. body is complex mechanisms - criticial centers in body - brain, heart, stomach - any damage can be fatal.
                                        atma is eternal, body is temporary - many interactions levels
                                                atma is situated in heart but consciousness thru subtle body (mind), brain.
                                        consciousness coming thru the blood? - the whole mechanism is complex.
                        18-21 - how Gita's understanding of soul and reincarnation is superior to that given in other religion
                        18 - Body is bound to finish but inside body won't.
                            you can't save body or destroy soul. 
                            e1 is sentenced to death but don't know the expiry date like other products.
                            can't be measured - not just smallness but also spiritual dimension.
                            information b4 but instructional statement here.
                        19 - soul neither kills nor is killed.
                            Arjuna kills so what's the point - body dies with its natural course. Kartaham mentality that I can kill, the body was gonna get killed anyway.
                            Not to justify oh anyways gonna die - kartaham mentality here.
                            Punishable legally and natural course also.
                        20 - naiti strategy - Jnani way of not body, not air, not this - negation of material to affirmations of spiritual.
                            soul doesn't take birth die - things that apply to body don't apply to soul.
                            concept is hazy in other religions - abrahamic religions - reference seems like metaphorical reference to non-material essence.
                            no self knowledge of much. Soul is literal high-dimensional entity (being) in vedas
                            love with all thy soul - metaphorical - put all your being into it. 
                            We also use - Put heart and soul in service - not biological heart but metaphorically emotions and being.
                            I put my soul into project - my soul - philosophically I am soul but metaphorically being put into something.
                            abrahamic religions are history centric vs dharmic religions - buddhism, jainism, sikhism - historical events there also but not primary birth based.
                                research for principles of universe and harmonize with those principles.
                            Peculiar - Buddhism - reincarnation without soul. Christianity - soul without reincarnation.
                                Buddhism
                                    flow of consciousness moving forward - in next life also - stream of consciousness.
                                    Buddha rejected vedas - so many animals killed - forget vedas - reduced vedas to material grats with justification of vedas.
                                    he was practical and not into metaphysics - are you god or angel or supreme; who are you? I am awake.
                                    soul is same or different from body - I decided not to answer - avoided metaphysical questions he won't understand. His focus was sattvik life and metaphysics was avoided.
                                    but many disciples bring in concepts that weren't there originally.
                                    Buddism as rebel religion - stand against caste and vedic authority so to distinguish as independent - different ideas they came up with - We don't believe in soul - very unsustainable idea.
                                    @Flame of candle keeps changing but appears to stay same - SB uses this analogy in 11th canto for material things - illusion of continuity but persistence of vision.
                                        observer is continuous although external is changing.
                                        candle is source of flame - material manifestations of consciousness change - like emotions. Observer remains the same.
                                Christianity says semi-eternal soul.
                                    Jesus says born blind cuz his misdeeds or his parents - he says neither - demonstrates the glory of god - didn't answer but what he doesn't say is also important.

                                        2-3 century romans collapsed due to internal conflicts but persecutions of christians b4 that.
                                        4th century - bring back basic morality established christinaity as official religion - remarkable changes came.
                                        they started doing what was done to them - 1000s of year - roman catholic church - heretic beliefs? persecuted.
                                        Eg - Bruno talked immortality of soul so was burnt alive.
                                        eternity concept was removed - reincarnation for past and future also.
                                        If give them many chance then people won't stay moral - give them 1 life or eternal hell so they act proper outta fear of god.
                                        Significant evidence for this. sections and references Downplayed, poised or athemos (declared deviant).
                                    Many problems
                                        inequities of life - why 1 born blind and not other - God seems arbitrary - very difficult to explain.
                                            @Cricket match with starting score of 200 while chase. Why - Score board was chance or partial.
                                            our workings in life follow cause and effect connection - do this and that happens - what we do and what we get are at delta.
                                            doctrine of helplessness - things by chance; 
                                            God makes things go wrong - accept will of God - complex - discriminatory God - can't understand will of god but broad understand what is question of developing love for God.
                                            Former alternative seems better to people.
                                            3rd alternative - 2nd innings of the cricket and previous score is continuing like karma of past life.

                                                This has positive impact on life. Only flesh life reduces life to meaninglessness.
                                        Why people born in places that never heard of Jesus so eternal hell? That's so not fair.
                                        Thou shalt not kill - animals - but doesn't say eternal.
                                        abortion is crime - they never heard of jesus so hell for them? - no, heaven cuz they did nothing wrong.
                                            what's goal of life - to go back to jesus - so abort every child for sure shot way 
                                            no how can you do - no, if goal of life and destination of abortion are same, then that's what is being proposed.
                                        1 life chance not relatable to parents giving > 1 chance to children.

                        22 - transmigration of soul or reincarnation - not same - focus on journey across and other is coming into flesh.
                            metamorphosis also another word - analogy conveys dress - permanence aspect is focussed.
                            dress given as per TPC and purpose - like polar and equator regions. So does body.
                            reincarnation - soul leaves body; soul accepts temporary body and travels to new body under supersoul's guidance; soul enters new body.
                                soul leaves thru one of the holes. Yogis use skull for highest liberation.
                                dressed for and dressed by our desires - fulfill desires like woman attraction for future.
                                @buying a new dress - our budget and our desire we get a new one.
                            body and soul is temporary relp and not given lots of information - this is missing in other traditions.
                                bury the body - judgement day after life - the same body we will have in heaven. Coffin kept but still it gets decayed.
                                    Also the problems like if diseased then diseased body; old body and if too young, then will he get body that he could have become in youth.
                                    the problem is mixing of body and soul ideas.
                                Religious understandings can be misunderstood.
                                    dangerous that suicide bombers to brainwashed into believing that 73 virgins in heavens.
                                    kill others in hopeful pleasures of after life.
                                    The problem here is not afterlife but material conception of life - fundamental difference - many future life believers but didn't become.
                                    I will get future enjoyment so let me sacrifice now. But still about enjoyment. Still about my sensuality.
                                    That way any belief system can be distorted like stalins and hitler - atheists they were.
                                    Life is sacred and must be valued. In atheism if life is chance event and goal of life is to enjoy and morality obstructs enjoyment, what will people do?
                                This material conceptions is shattered in the very beginning.
                        23 - Things which harm the body don't harm the soul.
                            After Hiroshima Nagasaki - several times more power and island disappeared from world map.
                            Brahmastra, etc - technology difference? - yes in wrong hands - like in hands of terrorists can do lots of harm.
                                Kshatriya - Kshat + Trayate. Else disturbance to soceity.
                                Atom Bomb - lots of energy to be tapped but here for destructive purposes - radiation - think as fire weapons but other ways also.
                                Tornedo can cause destruction but we can't cause them.
                                Karmic causality - movement of wind by devatas so with an instrument of their blessings they could control.
                                Jiva can manipulate prakriti for good or bad purposes - with tech, we understand with redunctionistic forces - particles, forces and laws => control.
                                Another view - hierarchical view of power - power of jivas with greater control over prakriti and we satisfy them thru rituals, tapasya and religious powers then control over prakriti.
                        24 - characteristics that satisfy assertions given b4.
                            sarva-gatah - all pervading? We dress and take another dress - being ew - then where's transmigration - from one to another body.
                                Soul is capable of going everywhere and living everywhere. Life in other planets and situations.
                                Life as we know it doesn't exist on other planets - oxygen, temperature - all these based on premise that life can exist only in such situations.
                                Body of fire then can live on sun. Searched not below surface of moon - extremophiles on earth for eg.
                                things are not as simple as we are led to believe some live on Nitrous oxide only.
                                Small crack and full of ants. Why waste of space - Why God would create that space to waste.
                            acala - soul immovable - then where's transmigration again. MOG and MOP and MOI - go upwards, downwards.
                                soul can't be moved by anything material - only by its own will.
                                Yamadutas yamapasha can't catch soul - subtle body is taken and soul being attached goes with it.
                                @guy enjoying cricket on TV and TV is moved, what happens to the person? he moves with it.
                            male reference - these days it's separated but when male references are inclusive like man is maker of his destiny - this includes women also.
                                of course, there's svarupa for jiva in spiritual world - that form has gender but is spiritual and transcendental.
                        25 - 
                            Inconceivable - then what's the need to conceive it also.
                                can't conceive with independent endeavors - scriptural guidance and logical inference we can think about soul.
                                deeper understanding then tradition - not by speculation.
                            6 changes of body - don't apply to body.
                            no lamentation cuz higher destination then why worry.
                        26 - 
                            biochemicals claims but no life produces from chemicals. Only slightly modified forms success till now.
                                Not artificial life creation - take DNA and replicate DNA or slightly change it - let the thing grow and life emerges.
                                structure thru which life comes has been modified but how life comes about is unknown.
                                @soundtrack and made some changes and played on different device but soundtrack came from a singer originally.
                                    physical medium is the soundtrack - this is taken from a book - music of life.
                                    consciousness is not just in biochemical arrangement. soundtrack is just a medium.
                                no scientific or philosophical basis - grand claims by spin doctors or media managers for publicity.
                        27 - whoever is born has to die and vv.
                            just a bunch of chemicals then why lament - then form has changed so why lament.
                            By giving up duty you can't stop the unavoidable so don't stop.
                        28 - unmanifest to manifest and again unmanifest then why worry.
                            all emotions and eth becomes meaningless.
                            Love of mother is just chemicals in brain - then love is held without meaning.
                    29-37 - How Krishna counters Arjuna's no enjoyment Argument
                        29 - ashcarya word repeated. see, talk, hear as amazing and nothing amazing for them.
                            enlightened vision so tiny but animating a giant body - human, whale, sequotia tree, germs, etc.
                                aggressive and timid but so much variety - inclination so different.
                                try to be happy in places but soul is amazing by nature.
                                level of realization to see soul - terrorist perversion level.
                                so amazing at spiritual or even material level.
                                understand that I am eternal - knowledge itself is so amazing.
                                body is hungry, I feel hungry and tired so do I - no knowledge about soul.
                                You are not this body then whose body am I - bodily conception is so deep.
                            figure of speech - transfer epitit. adjective put to another place for poetic purposes.
                                Eg - traveller goes on tired road - actually the traveller wsa.
                                Some amazing people see the soul; some amazing people understand the soul.
                                    sushupti, jagriti vs turya.
                                    so rare who share KC - and few enquire about soul. Rare 1 of 1000s.
                                    sad or regretful sense - amazing those who don't come. REL Yudhisthir what's greatest amazement.
                                    this is amazingly or tragically stupid.
                                    @villains shooting hero from all sides and I will be lucky one to not get hit.
                                Another adjective can also be applied to verb. Act of perception.
                                    some people amazingly see the soul - goes deep. Seeing so deeply.
                                    amazingly don't understand.
                                Why they don't - too attached to material things. Attachments blind them.
                                    attachments are binding and blinding.
                                    Bilvamangal DT - attachment that dragged him blindingly to the society of women.
                                    Drunken driver - can't resist drive and kills sb st.
                        30 - conclusion of atma-jnana. Indestructible.
                            All are eternal. Not that animals, plants excluded. Or websites on what's your next birth - as if for selected few.
                            Don't let compassion be restricted to only bodily platform.

                </SankhyaJnana>
                <KarmaKanda>
                31-38 - Karma Kanda (1st application of atma-jnana):Fight - by doing your prescribed duties, you will enjoy (counters Arjuna's enjoyment argument)
                    Dharma => artha, Kama.
                    31 - discussion to next level - if I am not body but soul - then how I act in life - ok, it's transitory so avoid living in world
                        work systematically - move forward and think - so KK is first. Act in Karma Kanda but in Dharmik framework.
                        If you don't fight you won't be able to enjoy rather than opposite as Arjuna proposed.
                        no need for shaking - not just external but internal weakness of heart. Indecision state.
                        No greater glory for Kshatriya - shreya - higher good than righteous war.
                        svadharma is material duty - VA. Yoga and sadhana is nitya dharma.
                            Both of these should be done harmoniously.
                        Brahmana yajna then elevated. Kshatriya fights then elevated.
                            animal sacrifice - tug of war - principle of ahimsa and rituals involved in some of injunctions. Those animals get elevated.
                            always discouraged by all acaryas like madhvacarya - clay replica of animal will also do made of grains but meat eaters will not like to do that so accomodated.
                            Durga is Vaishnavi so doesn't want blood - people like it and she accepts the role in material management.
                            Don't reject but contextualize them. Difficult and controversial statements and contradictions - understand them in context.
                            Kshatriya - doesn't mean provoke war to get elevated.
                            It's not a license for indiscriminate violence but last option like MB.
                            Such statements are there to inspire people to stick to dharma.
                    32 - attain it when dharma and punya and gradual detachment then heaven. Dharmic war are doors for heaven that's why.
                        why Krishna glorifies heaven - when even nirvana like hell.
                            Krishna is taking knowledge step by step
                            not changing the definition of enjoyment for Arjuna - taking material definition and showing directions.
                        kshatriya means protect praja - all in kingdom - cows, animals, eth.
                    33 - if you don't do, you lose dharma and also reputation.
                        @Doctor - crime of negligence if you know what you should do.
                    34 - infamy comes from that
                        infamy stays for long time cuz of gossip - Krishna is reporting global behavior not condoling it.
                            film stars - gossips and scandals - what he did with her, etc.
                            not reputation for our sake but for Krishna's sake - sharing gets impeded with such space in other's mind.
                            it's a lower nature to gossip - what to do about it.
                        don't act in ways that bring infamy.
                            words can cause wounds very deep. Emotional words - worse than death.
                    35 - But I am doing for elders and for virtue not outta fear.
                        that's not what people will think - they would think that you chickened.
                        they will consider you ordinary or insignificant. People see externals not motivations.
                    36 - 
                        people see actions and ascribe when would I do like this - on battlefield why would people stop cuz fear.
                        perceptions, actions, motivations - motivations are not known to ppl; only actions and based on that ppl make perceptions.
                            st gotta explain why we are acting in particular unusual ways.
                            attributional error - attribute a cause to - why eating a lot - he is greedy or glutton.
                                sleeping a long time? he is lazy! We give ourselves benefit of doubt but others we don't.
                                same action - I do then hungry other then greedy.
                                Eg - sweet is over - what is this person doing asking e1 - he was so sensitive that he had to be given sweet.
                                Action then My Motivation is I want sweet but was concerned about others.
                                investigate and try to understand - try to avoid it.
                                Eg - Sanyasi - dark spot shines like small flaw in sanyasi and e1 sees that. 
                                    So avoid attributional error and assume benefit of doubt for others.
                    37 - If you die you attain svarga. therefore rise and fight.
                        The situation Arjuna saw as lose is shown by Krishna as win-win so fight.
                    38-46 - Contrasting KY with KK.
                        Now fear of sinful reaction will be addressed onwards.
                        38 - sudden change but u-turn in thinking - motivation change from KK to KY - don't think from gain loss or profits.
                        ...continue in next section
                </KarmaKanda>
                <NishkamaKarmaYoga>
                39-53 - Nishkama Karma Yoga (2nd application of atma-jnana) Fight with detachment, then no sinful reactions (counters Arjuna's enjoyment argument)
                    1 level higher - with spiritual knowledge, goal is not going to svarga but beyond material existence.
                    39 - transitional verse explanation - Now Buddhi Yoga terms I will explain.
                        reference of god but not in 1st person Krishna said as God. And hence next verse doesn't say I will free him from fear.
                        Sankhya, buddhi and yuktya
                            sankhya - counting elements of existence. Culminating in soul.
                            combining the 2 thru buddhi yoga.
                            2 kapila - theistic and atheistic - atheistic one not in alignment with vedic conclusions so not credited so countered.
                            buddhi is internalized wisdom 
                                intelligence with which connect with deeper reality of life.
                                subtle inner dynamics of BG - words are not frozen but context based also.
                                    here in context it means deliberation of what's told till now. So, atma-jnana understanding to do yoga
                                it's quality of work - motivation behind work.
                    40 - Benefits of Buddhi yoga - even a little bit of progress, all fear freedom.
                        stays with us forever - in 6th chapter in detail.
                    41 - qualifications of such person.
                        1 pointed intelligence. Vyavasayatmika buddhi else n-branched.
                        consciousness dissipated - desires crowd mind, dielemmas cloud our intelligence.
                        @fitting house in suitcase seems impossible cuz it is impossible. 
                            So wanna do eth in 24 hrs - it's impossible so not that you won't travel but prioritize.
                        SP on one pointedness - everest or Nobel - anything in life - fanatically focussed - fanatic is e1 is bogus but me but that focus is powerful.
                            1 consuming focus - even 1 aspect of cricket like spinner I become, etc to rise to top.
                            Similarly studies - become engr, doctor, CA, eth - no be focussed.
                            Similarly, many things to be done in world by ISKCON - sth to be done in urgency and purpose - SM gives this.
                            VCT - make SM's instruction as life and soul.
                            Service - internally comfortable and externally competent to do the service - accordingly decided.
                            VA - Assuming based on birth is difficult at present time but with guidance and talents, abilities we can choose.
                        @Vyavasay - business like intelligence - always money like intelligence.
                            priority shapes perspectives - like visit to a house - what all they bought.
                            So see according to spiritual potential.
                    42-43 - Heaven etc don't think about those - flowery words though I also spoke b4.
                        they think that's what vedas teach.
                        janma, karma in heavens so huge sacrifices as price. But attached to bhog aishwarya.
                        they want indulgence and opulence (bhog and aishvarya).
                        Upanishads mark beginning of spiritual life.
                    44 - SG and opulence then consciousness is abducted.
                        Arjuna said abducted - Krishna material consciousness is anyways sign of abduction already.
                        continuation of thought is be one-pointed and who are not and why are they not.
                        important in our spiritual life - how much to lose b4 losing blindness - dhritarashtra - his blindness was not just physical but spiritual
                            so much good advice but attachment blinded him. He lost eth b4 he came to consciousness.
                            Later vidura cut thru his attachments. Cut them off thru knowledge else gotta pay the price by continuation of cycle of BODD.
                        @abduction is strong word - demanding ransom from child - consciousness abducted by lust and greed and doesn't go to Krishna - what do they demand?
                            indulgence is the random - so much they are demanding let me indulge - let me be over way - in dharmic way is ok but relief temporarily but not release.
                            relief doesn't give release. Do this - n - next time it becomes more difficult. 
                            Like abducted, don't let it happen again else keep paying higher ransom cuz rewarded for it.
                            consciousness is rooted in material world thru mind so used interchangably.
                        As arjuna asking but all this is given in vedas yes but gotta go beyond MMN.
                    45 - go beyond MMN and dualities. Be stated in Spiritual goodness.
                        possessor of the soul - aatmavaan - spiritually aware - wealthy but intoxicated then doesn't know it.
                        we are atma but aware of that then aatmavaan.
                    46 - purpose of well served by flowing rivers.
                        How can I go against vedas - you ain't going against but beyond - sections for different purposes like wells.
                        Vedas has ultimate purpose also - to know him and return to him.
                    47-53 - 2 definitions of yoga and its general understanding
                    47 - right to do karma (ppl quote 1/4th part - not fruit, not producer of fruit; not do karma only)
                        half hen logic - let me cut of front part - then no proper results.
                            only sections that fit in our world then miss out on what it has to offer.
                            elevation in understanding us, world and God and relationship - this is quarter hen logic.
                        flow has been - seek the eternal, detached from material, how to live to attain eternal.
                        Frameshift here - last minute study or revision to get result - few have right to work - ppl think they have right to result.
                            how can work produce spiritual results - depending on work - SCA nature of soul and things that make us forget our nature like grats.
                            students learn the subject and mind grows - faculty of thought - reasoning and grasping capacity.
                            purpose of action is not just result but transformation internally - growth of wisdom.
                            Brahmana has objective in mind - Bhakti shastri and I don't understand is ok. Cooking and ok if forget to add sugar in sweet. Is that correct understanding.
                                then arjuna could say - I don't care who wins. This is misunderstanding.
                                seeking results not wrong - that's not the focus.
                            3 levels - get result or top book distributor; purify ourselves; wanna please Krishna.
                                SKY, NKY and BY.
                                constantly thinking about result makes us weak at heart.
                            I am not hetu or cause of result - I hit six in last ball or prepared to give class
                                factors beyond control like they have their superstitions like hankerchief half out - all lids are closed - no correlation or on arm or earing on 1 ear.
                                They are recognizing beyond their control which has to go their way - their performance matter but fate, destiny, chance whatever name they matter.
                                Not that they will thru such action but its recognition.
                                preaching is a service but that's not original identity of servant of Krishna. Else distraction from spirituality.  
                            Action will purify so shunning from work that I am not beneficiary won't do that.
                                engaging body and mind will purify us so avoid inaction.
                    48 - become situated in yoga, equanimity.
                        platform for practice of yoga. Think of spiritual reality - need a foundation.
                        nothing in world to be too excited about - pleasure or pain both are distraction - nothing matters cuz temporary.
                        work calmly => stay focussed on spiritual reality.
                    49 - what I told you earlier are work fruits is kripana not far sighted.
                        they suffer in cycle of BODD. Surrender with intel and shelter in wisdom.
                        Think and dream big - still think small - win the rat race; and even if you win, you remain a rat.
                        choose infinite longings OR longing for the infinite.
                        no material fruits are gonna satisfy us.
                    50 - engage in yoga but yuddha in 48. Brahmana yoga in different way.
                        this is art of all work. karma expertise is yoga.
                        spiritual when I play guitar - samadhi in attaining goal by football player.
                        is it material expertise and expertise thereof that's yoga?
                        yoga is connection with Krishna, supreme of AT - work becomes spiritually consciousness - not easy but we can.
                    51 - destination of liberation as superior to heaven.
                        spiritual reality with work without attachment then liberation - can't be spiritual world cuz not yet started talking about himself.
                        boat of Lord's lotus feet crossed over like calf's hoofprint.
                    52 - forest of illusion gone beyond - intelligence stuck inside - what's right; free from misery of worldly traffic but also scriptures - promises of pleasures.
                        nothing will remain to be known. Rig veda - most materialist book by 1 author - sg is being talked about.
                        material pleasures in other lokas - transcended.
                        Kulshekhar - study of scripture is like crying in forest if rituals without pleasing Krishna.
                        Madhavendra Puri - Prayers 3 times, bathing - respects and glory, demigods, forefathers - sorry - respect from distance - Krishna defeats all my sins - this is sufficient.
                    53 - acala buddhi - mind is easy to shake cuz intelligence gets shaken.
                </NishkamaKarmaYoga>
                <SthitaPrajna>
                54-72 - Characteristics of sthita Prajna
                    54-59 - Seek the happiness that is beyond pleasure and pain.
                    54 - bodily misunderstanding and covered by mahamaya so asks questions what are symptoms of such a person.
                        several verses on transcendence and not immediate work - inauspicious work of killing relatives so in that context asks questions will such a person fight.
                        language, speak, sit, walk about such person - sounds like question on Mr World.
                        bhashya means commentary. Teeka is commentary on commentary. That which describes - so characteristics.
                        prabhashet - mannerism; sits - keeps senses under control; walking - not gait but in world filled with temptations how he operates.
                        so Krishna answers as follows
                            55 - Ka bhasha (characteristics)
                            56-57 - kim prabhasheta (speech)
                            58-63 - kim asita (how retrains senses)
                            64-71 - kim vrajeta (how engages senses)
                    55 - 1st question answered here - different words for the person - so adjectives also telling his qualities.
                        controlled desires from mind - satisfied with mind inwards.
                        gives up all desires then also of happiness - so mind desires originating are given up.
                            desires coming from senses and rejected; mind looking outwards or inwards.
                            mind is route of consciousness; soul is root of consciousness - can go outwards or direct inwards thru introspectives.
                            seeks pleasure externally vs internally - externals in temple may seem but they take us inwards.
                            initial stages we need external stimuli and take shelter in advanced stages also but lead us inwards.
                        internal and external simplistic - internal also has agitation and desires so simplistic wrt to body - mental is not spiritual so internal is wrt to mental - look at spiritual level.
                    56 - 2nd question answered from here till 57 - not wanting more what gives pleasure and less of what gives pain.
                        REL preacher - giving blessings for good treatment and bane for bad.
                        Speech not mentioned here? - not external - easy to duplicitous - talk nicely but internally wanna beat.
                            @employee keeping employers face on punching bag.
                            mentality of such a person - not unduly excited by events.
                        Veet raag bhay krodha - muni can agitate the mind to different inference.
                            bird flew away and fruit fell - cause and effect can be difficult to explain.
                            so many multiple factors involves in real life - but sthitadheer muni has arrived at conclusion.
                            kinkar - kim karoti - what to do.
                            problem in life - we don't deserve it - but even good we don't deserve - lucky breaks or unlucky sometimes - so past karma.
                                brahmaji - my karma coming but you have minimized.
                            SP probs that he faced in life - but he kept going without agitated by those situations.
                                daring and acting in spite of all that.
                                fearlessness doesn't come from absence of fear but awareness of presence that dwarfs fear. can't shy away from it.
                                anger internally frustration - resentment and hatred which comes in ugly ways.
                                SP kept on going - PD angry action but not controlled by anger.
                    57 - st good, bad, auspicious, inauspicious - doesn't praise or resent.
                        artificial that it's good or bad - anaesthesia so desensitize from material; no sensitize to spiritual - my service will anyways continue.
                        some material upheaval in material world - success also can do that - guards down and maya can attack.
                        13th day of MB - Abhimanyu - 8 maharathas to close jayadrath. Sudarshan cakra to cover sun and cloud of arrows avoided.
                        kauravas became distracted by pleasure so let their guard down so pleasure can make us lose our focus.
                    58 - 3rd question from here till 63 - tortoise withdraws limbs - so hard shell that even elephant can't break it.
                        cricket baller bowls the weak point of batsman; boxing - hit where it hurts - weakness so hurt there again to bring him down.
                        senses are weakness so guard them. General principle is avoid the touch with senses objects.
                        not talked about himself so can't say that now.
                        like radar looking for danger but with perverted intel, we are on lookout for danger - it seems like welcome message.
                        weariness and waryness - de-energized by desires pinches of gap of fantasy and finances.
                            marketing - advertisements fuel the fantasies. weary by those thru conflict with finances.
                            so be wary.
                        sometimes test my spiritual advancement by exposing to sense object - even if nothing happens, something happens - impressions get created on mind for future.
                            @is tiger dead or awake - let me check by pinching. tiger won't just pinch after waking.
                            lust is slept - there can be disaster.
                            Haridas T didn't go hunting for prosti - she came on her own but continued with DS.
                            so much exposure unavoidable but minimize.
                    59 - SO like food so nirahar. We mistake irresistable to be essential.
                        food vs Alcohol may seem irresistable but not for survival - feeling of necessity but subjective feeling but objective fact is you don't.
                        I need it can't live without it - higher taste - param drishtva - higher vision or perception.
                        buddhi grahyam atindriyam - beyond the senses - perceived thru senses as gateways like eyes for darshan and tongue for prasad.
                        it is spiritual experience - culminates in spiritual experience. Krishna is just hinting here not telling what it is.
                        giving material pleasures is denial. unnatural celibacy - cuz don't have higher happiness - denial get probs and also indulgence.
                        Depressed with overindulgence - material world probs.
                    60-63 - Control Concentration Conquest - 3 stages of self mastery
                        60 - even if trying but mind dragged by senses by force.
                            talking about yogis
                                materialists goal of life is enjoy senses so let it move.
                                Vikarmis defy religious principles for SG but karmis - enjoy SG as per religious principles. No extra marital or pre marital affairs.
                                yogis know that they have to control SG - self realization is goal - vision, discrimination and endavoring but senses drag away the mind.
                            mind the center of all the senses who bind with Sense object
                                @senses drag the mind - desires created by senses - mind is flamed to them like moth to fire.
                                sobering verse that how powerful senses are.
                                Eg - Vishvamitra - anklebells of menaka - sound is nothing but triggers the mind with fantasy of pleasures.
                                    from female perspective 
                                        also - if attracted to male, then like hunter will get shot 
                                        but more so from male perspective cuz male form is considered more suitable for self realization.
                                    Principle is generic description of SO for senses.
                            But thread from previous verse of higher taste - yamunacharya - spit at thought since I think of service to Krishna.
                                jolting for materialists - so lofty pleasure that disgusted and pity at it.
                                anything that distracts from Krishna - disgust cuz source of danger, distress and dismay that distracted from Krishna so jolted.
                                relishing the taste of Krishna but thought comes anyways. Purity in those times relatively.
                                impure thought may come but easily overcome. No for PD, Yes for materialists, sadhaka is Yes/no - wait till no1 around.
                                We have to make journey from Welcome to Nothing Doing - long journey but necessary.
                                to get thought isn't wrong - but not act on them. Kill thoughts b4 they manifest action.
                                @hungry got sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables - no need for anything else.
                                Eg - Ambarish M - how to apply is SP focus.
                        61 - controlling all the senses, put mind on Krishna then victory.
                            matparah - first drop of Krishna. I am object of senses. Till now only session on how to control senses.
                            Control -> Concentration -> Conquest.
                                Temple - Don't look at dresses of ppl. But easy to do.
                                Concentrate on Krishna in temple.
                                Conquest.
                                @Elephant - if behaves then you get food and conquest to control it.
                            yukta - fix mind on Krishna.
                            Durvasa Muni - VA based > Ambarish M. But not matparah - not focussed on Krishna.
                                Ambarish M - engaged all his senses in Krishna's services.
                                seeing temples is auspicious - like touch feet of devs and body reverentially.
                                LCM saw the disc of temple then dandavats.
                                feet to go to places of pilgrimage. head for respects.
                                He became able to control all his desires. And devp rati for Lord.
                                In essence, He engaged all jnanendriyas and karmendriyas not excretory cuz they are impure and not meant to be used.
                                    caught but with administration but not that can't systematically teach scriptures - not have to do classes but share with neighbors, book distribution, etc.
                                    not that he did these all the time but kingly administrative responsibilities but continued with these.
                                    when crisis came, then all of this investment helped him - kept calm. Throughout life he did so able to do it at that time.
                                    if not prepared consciousness then other shelters we seek.
                                    Fixing the mind (Concentrate) needs engagement of senses.
                        62-63 - when contemplate on SO -> attachment / attraction -> Lust / Obsession -> Anger / Irritation (I must enjoy who can stop me) -> illusion (forget, aware of what to do or not - scripture) ->
                            Smriti (shastra or memory lost or oblivion) -> intelligence lost or stupefaction cuz memory based -> falldown or Destruction.
                            Lust unfulfilled then anger - love anger. Not those kinda actions.
                            Infatuated or obsessed then any obstacle leads to anger - forgetfulness.
                            At the process to fall and process to stop it - is it irreversible - no, it can be reversed.
                            @horse riding - go in particular direction - I want it and runs and throw me somewhere but momentum then greater exertion reqd to stop.
                                We can still get back on horse after horse goes to vegetables and topples the rider.
                                trouble to let it go and then control. More difficult as we let it pass.
                                Keep masks on eyes for focussed vision and so.
                            @snowball effect - could be kicked earlier but can snub under it later.
                            imagination is triggered. word choice - Krishna is not saying seeing sense object but contemplating - imaginatoin runs wild.
                            just seeing table - he has bigger table.
                            attachment is already there - awakened by imagination - spiritualize the imagination and not suppress it.
                            It's ok to be good cooks, teachers, etc - be good at what we do - some element of ego may be there 
                                clever or learned I am so shall we stop doing - accept it for encouragement.
                                cultured attitude then continue without pride.
                                Spiritualize our imagination - seeing a building - avenue for imagination - seeinga  temple there. Seeing a person - if he could be engaged in KC.
                            At any stage we can check ourselves.
                            Steals away our taste in KC. Cuts from spiritual consciousness and can't perceive and relish KC.
                    63-70 - Rising from material enjoyment to spiritual fulfillment
                    4th question answer starts from here.
                    63 - dhyayato to prashyati sequence seemed inevitable but it's not cuz we can control reins of the horse at any stage.
                    Shiva agitated by Parvati but not Haridas T - we may feel that Shiva is a devata - Shiva told as dhira in other places.
                        comparison not of people but of process. Glory of HN - Shiva as yogi so this is context.
                        Both exalted personalities and worshippable - material position and power not enough to overcome pull of templatation - protective Lord's grace is reqd.
                    Anger to pranashyati - senses gotta engage in DS.
                        Phalgu vairagya - things connected to hari if renounced then phalgu.
                        can't start walking with closed eyes so using in Krishna's service is the solution.
                    64 - senses have tendency to SO - follow the vidhi - if do then mercy of higher happiness.
                        how to get higher taste thru practice
                        @small child like play - balance of what likes and what's long term good.
                        scriptures ban only harmful but doesn't stop - purified and keep free from trouble - no more impurities. HN purify further.
                        SP - regulative principles of freedom. regulation isn't necessarily deprivation of freedom - 
                        @mother's embrace of child is not restriction but can be for protection.
                        @fencing of house is restriction or protection - depends on what's important - outside is distraction and business seed is inside.
                        goal is material enjoyment then deprivation but krishna prema then regulative principles are for freedom. Freedeom from distractions that drive us away from Krishna.
                        @Doctor restricts patient - for health - and greater freedom with cure.
                        So much joy in Krishna's connection.
                    65 - prasadam means mercy - follow regs then fixing mind on Krishna becomes easier cuz we are purer.
                        all misery goes away for such a person. intel rock solid.
                        joy despite miseries - miseries are there but they don't matter cuz so much available for us.
                        @meal is dried chapatti vs many food items in feast with 1 item not so good then it stops to matter.
                        misery and material level and so is consciousness then nothing better to experience - only 1 food to eat - it's miserable it is.
                            vs spiritual level consciousness - so much richness so doesn't matter so much.
                        intelligence gets fixed with that taste. Not before?
                            intel strong with scripture - fixedness of buddhi greater with taste. sensible, logical b4 but experiential is more powerful.
                            doctor approach with little faith but experience then strong faith.
                            in beginning can't trust intelligence - scripture based is important.
                            understanding thru hearing is good - experience will reinforce so hear now.
                            many philosophers and thinkers and scholars scientists - but no sense control, greed, affairs - why? 
                                Material intel and spiritual intel - process information quite well, significant insights poetic metaphors or literary values, inventions and discoveries which significantly changes technology.
                                but no higher taste itself - comes from GSS - scriptures our fences.
                    66 - !mind and intel focussed => !basic peace => !Happiness
                        wandering mind - no steadiness of focus - going in dozen directions and dangerous places can ruin us.
                        peace doesn't mean without anxities - doesn't mean so remote side kutir for peace - this is more internal than external peace.
                        what's my goal - fixed then peace - orderly situations also but mainly from inside.
                        Disturbance is due to want of ultimate goals - don't get goal then disappointment and get it then temporary relation with it. Mind deludes us.
                            ultimate goal is relationship with Krishna - may want things in world also but Krishna is ultimate goal.
                        dignified and peaceful some people may seem - sattvik disposition of culture and can be facade also - appearance and substance are not always same.
                            western countries - very clean and orderly - great virtue but people often have contaminated desires.
                            externally clean but internally unclean sometimes - so can't judge and may be agitated.
                            people may have desires that trouble themselves or others - peaceful facade might to influence others to act in favorable ways.
                            values that drive a person or goals - then we can say if it's a facade (not durable) or it's a substance.
                    67 - senses are wandering. focus object can drive away sense like boat dragged by storm.
                        desires can sweep us - how to protect - e1 is vulnerable.
                        storm can come then prepare and defense against it.
                        avoid stormy areas - general and our specific stormy areas. I won't fall prey.
                        senses - look for pleasurable object - it stares and gets devoured - mind drags intel.
                        2.59 similar - Sense object, senses and mind - here it's dragging of intel. There it was dragging of mind.
                        Krishna is talking here about positive engagement - so focussed on Krishna - world of sense object then danger. Don't focus on SO with mind.
                        intel already fortified but don't let mind focus on it.
                    68 - You have conquered but control senses now.
                        test of character or strength is not physical strength - sand castles broken by storm.
                    69 - metaphorical verse - night of e1 is day for yogi and vv.
                        period of inactivity or lack of stimulation. Activities of interest are different then focuses or foci are different.
                        SG is chewing the chewed for yogi so not interested.
                        Day for spiritualist - advancement in KC, devp relp with Krishna and newer happiness in relp with Krishna - incomprehensible - what you do chanting same thing for 2 hrs.
                        can't devp spiritually if hold on to material defn of success - big in life, enjoy in life and grow in KC - talents in KC is good but not caught up like them.
                            goal is not fame but prema.
                            Ford car owner - Ambarish Pr - great grandson of Henry ford - where is he now? not paranormal vision of next species.
                                big empire and is gone - doesn't stay with us - cultivate wealth that we can hold on to.
                                material intel or spiritual intel - internet and tech and designing course - requires intel.
                                focus only on temporary to make better and better - need balance.
                        why this metaphorical verse - control senses then what's enjoyment available - different definition of enjoyment - only removing or controlling material can seem enjoyment so gotta navigate to that defn.
                    70 - incessant flow of desires - river into ocean but ocean level stays the same. Not kaam kaami - not desirer of desires.
                        Desires going outwards vs going inwards - desires come in us - allurements - we don't accept those desires.
                        @knock on door - not interested vs flow with it.
                        we gotta be like ocean - krishna is prema sagar - oceanic happiness and any proposal comes we can easily say no but small puddle of satisfaction then driven.
                        else agitated and deluded. Desires come but not allured.
                        Peace not by indulgence but transcendence. Transcended the desire.
                        lost inclination for desires even though desires are present - from outside but no reciprocal attraction towards them.
                    2.71 to 3.03 - Understanding Prabhupada's strategy in presenting the Gita
                        person in KC has no desires to be fulfilled - doesn't even want liberation from so called bondage. bhukti mukti kaami sakale ashant.
                        No material bondage for devotees - it's just a apparation - not real.
                    71 - without arrogance, possessiveness and false ego - attains happiness.
                        spiritual desires may also take away our peace but truly make us supreme peace - connected with Krishna.
                        Peace of mind vs heart - no anxiety, fear vs based on love and relp is eternal and unbreakable and deepen that which we can further.
                        BG talks about peace of heart. Desires are core not peripheral - KC.
                        detachment from negative is talked here but positive later.
                        Desire in KC is desirelessness - cuz coming from nature - not foreign.
                    72 - stays in that state of peaceful, not deluded and attain liberation if at last moment.
                        first call for consciousness at death really matters. Details in 8th chapter.
                        brahmi is 3rd gender - male, female and neutral.
                        jiva goswami - devotionalizes rules of grammar - spiritual names for gender also - narayan ling and laxmi ling.
                            brahmi is feminine - hint to Radharani - medium and mediatrics - means to attain Krishna.
                            situated in brahmi state then no deluded.
                            9.13 also indirect reference to Radharani - daivim prakritim ashritah.
                            SP BG references only once in invocation that's only in shloka.
                            it's exalted topic - SP does give us hints of esoteric truths in BG but primary focus is systematic understanding of fundamental spiritual concepts.
                        understand and accept the fact.
                        SP strategy in BG is well thought out - BG as it is
                            understanding of conclusions is important - bhakti - all concepts but whatever aspect is presented is in connection with conclusion so that should stay.

                Misc
                        Argument for kula kshaya - gets countered in 3rd chapter.
                        Argument for indecision made in beginning gets countered in the end of BG when expresses decision I will fight.
                        This was a long chapter in shlokas. Longest is 18th with 78 verses - 2nd is 2nd chapter.
                        >40 are the longer chapters. cuz 700/18 = 38.88

                About
                    Flow of chapter is not linear but spiral - moving forward but not linearly.
                        Should I fight or not fight is perplex - for you KY is better than JY but in hierarchy.
                        Not qualified for KY then do KK and try for KY. If qualified for JY, then do KY to set eg.
                        Then will I get liberation - yes you do. What is then causes entanglement? Lust.
                    Last chapter ended with peace in last chapter.
                <KYBetterThanJY>
                1-10 - KY is better than JY.
                    1 - intel > fruitive then why war?
                    2 - intel is bewildered. decisively tell what's beneficial.
                        Arjuna sees 2 options
                            Inactivity (Renouncing) - buddhi
                            Activity (Fighting) - Vikarma
                        Krishna doesn't refer to fight at all - only 2.38 but again none afterwards.
                            previous instructions not cancelled but not emphasized again.
                            Other concepts which seem to be contradictory to fight - shanti means peace in conclusion 70 and 71.
                            Krishna talked about peace of heart. 
                            Krishna uses words correlated with not fighting and buddhi - term used with JY context and Jnana strongly correlated with Vairagya in Vedic days.
                            ?Arjuna is not seeing conglomeration of yogic systems
                        Krishna has spoken 4 levels:
                            JY - Renounced inactivity - no fighting.
                            NKY - Renounced activity - fighting for liberation.
                            KK - Fruitive activity - Fighting for heaven.
                            Vikarma - Sinful Activity - Giving up fighting.
                            Krishna has recommended NKY - consciousness and motivation underlying the activity is emphasized from 39 to 72.
                                ?Krishna didn't tell Arjuna what to do but actions, concepts and results.
                                2.49 Krishna condemns KK compared to NKY.
                                    Arjuna thinks fighting is condemned to JY. 
                                    Buddhi is superior to inauspicious work were the exact words so wrong correlations.
                    3 - There are 2 kinds of faiths - KY and JY - 2.39 from sankhya to buddhi yoga.
                        ones consciousness and adhikar - adequate realization.
                        Most graphic way of SP translating eth as DS - Karma yoga as DS.
                            Eg - SP asked by Mayavadi - Krishna not there but you put him - mayavadis remove Krishna where he is there. Maam 6 times - surrender to unborn within Krishna.
                            Conclusive understanding and contextual requirement
                                BG has a flow but concludes in forget eth you heard and just surrender unto me. Emphatic understanding. Mad yaji b4 this also.
                                    Arjuna followed instruction of Krishna in conclusion.
                                contextual requirement - ppl don't read spiritual so much - not so much interest. Some donation let me read - any page you open you should get the essential message.
                                    SP fulfills Krishna's mission - whatever conclusions thru intricate flow of thoughts which kali ppl lack.
                                    SP ensures crystal clear understanding all throughout.
                                    by all ur work worship me krishna says here and and there also.
                                    Some scholars say SP is bhakti fanatic so ew he says bhakti-3.
                                    2.72 sth interesting - BVT says glimpse of BY in 2.61 - yuktasit matparah so he knows it's a glimpse but wants to not miss the conclusion.
                                    not simplistic translation of eth as bhakti but focussed conclusion he presents.
                                    SP asked next commentary he said BG - but you have given - other commentaries can also be presented from other acharyas perspective.
                                    For our perfection BG is sufficient but for exploring depths we can relish newer meanings ed.
                            practical and bhakti understanding together SP gives.
                            SP keeps rooting us in basics - yajnik brahmanas in 10th cantos - caught up in technicalities - neglected food he asked for.
                            LCM pastimes - south indian brahmana - their cheers not affected but tears - he became charioteer of devs such love - such magnitude - embraced that you know essence.
                    3-9 - 3 reasons why KY is preferable to JY
                    3 - Philosophy BG and religion chanting but not strictly but generally.
                        fanaticism without philosophy and only philosophy without practice then no transformation - maybe god exists and earthquake ppl died then lost to alcohol at least taste exists definitely.
                        Science = Theory + Experiment; Spirituality = Philosophy + Religion.
                            Observation and explanation proposed is theory (like Newton observed apple falling and thought of a reason) - experiment to ensure tha theory is correct.
                            Immortality - where is the nature coming from.
                            Religion is higher taste for higher spiritual realities explained thru philosophy - then higher taste and give up lower ones.
                            Experimental is science and experiential is spirituality like SP transformed people.
                            Science is universal - repeatability - don't know for sure but as much as we experience.
                            Spirituality is a higher dimensional science.
                            religion ritually without conviction - ball catching by boy vs engr - ball comes fast so stronger wall.
                            peaceful and feel good in temples but alternatives and it doesn't last.
                            REL - I am not feeling religion cuz tamo guna is high like sine wave.
                    4 - without karma, not freedom from reactions.
                        JY differentiator is not external form adoption; but inner purification.
                        Just by sanyas inner transformation doesn't happen.
                        In BY we have external forms, kali's chela hypocritical devotion - just disturbance to social order.
                        SUP - utpataiva kalpate.
                        By accepting danda, nara become narayan - but this doesn't happen as per this shloka.
                    5 - Forced action as per MMN.
                        Action is natural - freedom from MMN then don't need to act? Body doesn't act - soul drives energy to material things.
                        soul is active in embodied state but increases when it's removed like sack on the head removed. MMN direct the action.
                    6 - hypocrisy is reward without price. Politician profession for rewards but no sacrifices is hypocrisy.
                        sanyas is sacrifice of worldly sex life, etc.
                        hypocrisy of guru is reward of being a guru but can't guide.
                        we also get bad thoughts then hypocrisy? Picture galaries we have there is high flashback ?stream and continuous and kindle it
                            what we do with those bad thoughts is the question. Don't try to refresh from external. Internal recall is bad but don't water it.
                        Sequence - External and Internal change, External but sincere attempt to internal, external and no internal; external but old internals continuum or stream.
                        a show of meditation has no value whatsoever if internally into SG.
                        renunciation is not sadhana but an envt that helps sadhana the best.
                            it's a tool for sadhana. Eg - LCM - I am servant of Krishna not worldly roles.
                    7 - controlling senses under KY is far superior.
                        engage karmendriyas. Act on jnanendriyas cause bondage not just perceptions.
                        how can I stay in touch and still be detached - out of sight => mind is good but st mind so hooked that we can't. Some detachment is necessary for KY, yes.
                        so regulated engagement is the point. No Eating, no! we have regulated eating thru prasadam.
                        sincere sweeper > pretentious yogi for making a living. Sudra > Brahmana in VA sense.
                            externals are useful to the extent they aid in the internals.
                        Some outta laziness - escapeway of worldly life - hard work for money; get a job. Negative perception for e1.
                        Live in a way that honors the dress - if not living properly in orange robes then don't associate with them.
                        Dhams also places of devotion and deviation - perpetuation of pseudo renunciates.
                        Pilgrims come for seva and also those for easy donations.
                        engage your talents in BY 
                            Eg - land troubles my chanting - SP said mine also - your anxiety for Krishna increases relp for Krishna.
                            Take managable anxiety, of course.
                    8 - 1 more reason for VA - better than not working. Can't even maintain body without it.
                        Pilgrimage thru the body of soul's journey.
                        Krishna has given 3 reasons - unnatural doesn't help purification, social disturbance, maintenance of body.
                        Every Varna have their svadharma.
                        Ok, but my original question was bondage - Krishna says no that won't happen.
                    9 - Work for Vishnu (yajna or sacrifice) then no bondage.
                        yoga takes many forms like meditation or ahuti in fire but principle is sacrifice.
                        such waste of resources to put them in fire.
                        agni is lowest in terms of accessibility not power and vishnu at top - thru agni to e1 - how? some complex system.
                        @credit card system - losing money in exchange of paper (money worth in credit card) - you gotta understand the system.
                        sacrifice means what could be done for myself is done for others.
                        VA purpose is to satisfy Vishnu in its essence.

                10-16 - If you are not qualified even for KY then practice KK.
                    10-13 - Is the concept of demigods controlling natural phenomena like rains scientifically tenable
                    10 - Prajapati sent forth jiva and gave them yajna for reciprocations
                        cosmic cooperation - Lord arranges thru nature; not sent to wilderness.
                        child given milk thru mother's milk. Humans discharge duties thru regulating ESMD that animals can't.
                        Sankirtan Yajna given by LCM - SUPP in SB.
                    11 - prosperity by cosmic cooperation. Supreme auspiciousness.
                        Scientists are like priests of society - what's acceptable and not.
                        science is a tool like map not in conflict with religion - map is neutral 
                        conflict has been between materialism and spirituality.
                        Unfortunately this tool of science is hijacked and monopolised by atheists.
                            Materialism - matter is reality. Leads to atheism but has room for god also.
                            Spirituality - spirit is the essence or reality.
                        SP saying sth against science is primarily against materialists. Some materialists are fanatically aggressively against spirituality.
                            Religion is virus that corrupts the minds of people of society.
                            campaign against God - religion of atheism - such people are few who convert ppl to their religion.
                            science focuses on materialism but can promote spiritualism also. NDE, etc - not unscientific.
                        Is demigods acceptable - science is a tool that studies matter so can neither prove or disprove god's existence.
                            intricate design so we can infer presence of intelligent designer.
                            Water cycle - but we can't make 1 cloud in laboratory - rain in sw else.
                                Artificial rains, imaginary gains, pains - cloud seeing - preexisting clouds are condensed artificially.
                                Precisely where the clouds will rain down - artificial rain was found unacceptable in USA.
                                we have very limited control. It is miracle of technology how cloud is made and it rains. mobile Water tank - without leakage aircraft proof.
                                rare and complex raw materials to make such system but so simple in the world.
                                ?what is the probability of it happening.
                            Mechanism understanding isn't enough - it happens we just are aware of it to some degree.
                            Automatic - Child sees toy moving - 7 moving. Door opens automatically when we come close - sensor - program is written that we are not aware of.
                            Nature seems to act automatically. Complex mechanism is overseen by SPOG which are controlled by demigods.
                            Science study and scriptural study are not contradictory but complementary
                            Movies show some simplistic representations - Indra throws vajra and lightning and rains. Seems mythology!
                                so fantastic this is. Simply for representation - scripture don't say movies showcasing is praman.
                            Adjust nature in 2 ways - supplication and manipulation - controlling phenomena in nature - pray to them and they supply.
                                manipulation - don't look at persons who control mechanism but let me rig the mechanisms.
                                @Dacoits want water supply - go to govt and pay for water - what are you doing there - fill forms and pipeline comes to them.
                                What is system - we will find a hole in there and get a supply for ourselves. so neglect the controllers.
                                Cloud seedings - cloud property rights like with rivers and other properties.
                                understanding and harmonizing with them is supplicative.
                            Imagine if sun had to charge us for energy is supplies to us as per govt rates.
                        Don't have simplistic notion of playing songs and kartals produce rains - purify hearts kirtans.
                            necessities are supplied for.
                            Consciousness controls nature - living in harmony gives material needs and gives spiritual purification.
                            Heaven is up - this is very simplistic - karmic Y-axis svargaloka is above else US and India ups are diametrically opposite.
                            Higher karmic qualifications to get there.
                            Harmonize ourselves with cosmic government or system (?like with social govt or social platform).
                            yajna is cosmic tax and needs get supplied when we do that.
                        So devs chant HK where there are draughts - rains may or may not come - mass karma, etc.
                            action produces reaction - so we are not here to counter Karma system.
                            our purpose is not rains for yajna but support the system that is in alignment.
                        Sequence - when we offer food, existence pure, memory purified, material detachment, liberation
                    12 - thieves if we don't cooperate with cosmic system.
                        @govt - water is stolen.
                        Hiranya - weak if we don't supply them yajna and defeat thme when weak.
                            Not true. Cuz demigods are far more superiod - like saying US dependent on Somalia.
                            Indra angry cuz of dishonor not food when yajna is stopped.
                            It is ack of authority. Garland and arati - not necessity but a way to respect them.
                            Not that they are nutritionally dependent but wrong on our part cuz of non-cooperation with the system.
                        5 yajnas - normal day today activities jivas get killed. Inevitable violence so such yajnas - sankirtan for kali.
                    13 - food offered freed from sins else eating sins.
                        All religions ack higher beings - our efforts are important but not all important (?framework and our exits)
                        grains farmers, dev cook and devs honor - as much as possible with intention of offering to Krishna.
                        Vegetarianism is important - minimizes violence but doesn't purify us. Still eating sin.
                            To Bob Cohen SP said nth great about that - in west it is. To 7 else, SP said great for vedic system.
                    14-19 - Yajnas differentiate humans from animals.
                        Mechanisms and demigods ain't contradictory but complementary.
                    14 - Rain -> Grain -> Yajna. 
                    15. Karma recommended in vedas.
                        Mechanist vs Personalist view 
                            @Billiards table - top view of board - never see players but sticks hitting balls and eth explicable in laws of collisions.
                            Force, collisions, laws of mechanics is correct but not complete - not just - expertise and desires of players makes it complete.
                            Beyond Mechanist explanation exists personalist explanation.
                        The Cycle of Sacrifice
                            Krishna (Akshara) : Source and Goal.
                            Anna -> Bhutani (Material bodies) -> Vedas -> Karma -> Yajna -> Parjanya (Rain) -> Anna.
                                Yajna
                                    Taking care of babies even animals so humans have something more - taking care of bodies is natural and necessary but not spiritual.
                                    This affection helps jivas live in world - arranged for thru human emotions - not to be minimized but can't be called spiritual, even animals do.
                                    Horizonal vs vertical relationship - yajna is the means to do that.
                                    DS is not a favor to demigods of Krishna - it's our duty.
                                    Yajna makes universal accessible to us. What we could use for ourselves we do for him.
                                Lord is source of eth but not visible - ??trans to even demigods (cabinet ministers)
                                @Water given to us and we pay taxes - we stop taxes and then water supply stops so it's all connected.
                                @Donkey passes thru traffic signal but we can't and get fine - cuz bigger donkey gotta follow rules.
                    16 - If not followed cycle of sacrifice then just SG and sinful life than wasted life.
                        Sin
                            Defn of sin of ppl is relative - crime is legally wrong and sin is morally or spiritually wrong.
                            Govt not as per scripture then they may not be same.
                            Eg - abortion is legalized in many nations - killing of child and that's hidden to world. It's a grievous sin.
                                clamp like object trying to catch it and child tries escaping.
                                life threat is exceptional but others not so much.
                        Vedas don't reject enjoyments - DAKM so Kama is within scope and Krishna says I am kama.
                            People neglect duties to God but only on SG. Indra and demigods have SG but follow laws of AT or guidance of Lord.
                            Yajna planned s.t DAKM and SG without entanglement.
                            SPOG is enjoyer of all yajnas - thru demigods also him only gets worshipped but improperly.

                <KY2EgIfJYLevel>
                17-24 - If you are qualified for JY, still practice KY to set example
                    17 - Rati inwards and delights within, no duty - transcended scope of duty.
                        we live in reciprocal world - horizontally and vertically.
                        Internal satisfaction - illuminated internally then no external obligation. World atma rati is used 3 times. JY are at this level.
                    18 - he has no purpose to do the duty and no reason to not do it also.
                        doesn't take shelter of other jivas. Not introduced BY but JY only.
                        Krishna talking horizontally only - not brahmana who is member of society.
                            doesn't take anything from anybody and doesn't have to give.
                            Kings st ready to give sages such confidence that they have no interest.
                            JY Sanyasi - Sanyasis are inside VA but almost outside the worldly scope.
                    19 - So do prescribed duty with detachment - in reference to JY excelled don't have to.
                        I am trans so don't need duty. If you are trans, then why not do it.
                        Prematurely joining then problem later to settle back. 
                        Can't decide trajectory of life based on feelings - what if they go away and probs later then where to go?
                        Frustration with worldly life is not sufficient qualification for renounced life or but positive spiritual life.
                        If makes no difference then do to set a good example.
                        First reference to parama apnoti - supreme goal can be achieved.
                    20 - Janak etc attained perfection only thru prescribed duty. As Arjuna asking but most perfectionists renounce - not really saying Krishna.
                        bondage not activity but internal activity.
                    21-26 - Are all the activities of Krishna exemplary
                    21 - Those in leadership role present good eg cuz ppl follow that.
                        Can't effect for our good way (even spiritual) - society can be estimated by their heroes.
                        Freedom fighters and politicians were role model - not spiritual minded in devotional sense.
                        Gandhi given Mahatma title - simplicity and morals. 
                        Film Stars, Sport stars or business magnets these days. Morals have declined and distorted also.
                            holistic entertainment in past but now it's one dimensional character with sex and violence to get woman.
                            independence of USA - morals and diligently working for society those days. MOG that care for people around them.
                            Sin considered fashionable. Scanty clothes and ppl start wearing.
                            vulgarity, exposure, Obscene language and imagery - termed as bold scenes instead of shamelessness - eb wants to be bold.
                            So this gets glamorized and leads to disaster - eternal enemy of soul.
                            to dress modestly is not cowardly.
                        Parents teacher and kings are natural leaders in society.
                            exemplary not from changing norms but universal standard from scriptures - like women liberation - let them wear what they want.
                        G Harrison promoted drugs in earlier days ppl thought would help in spirituality. Hippies became worse and Harrison thought responsible for bad promotion.
                            SP told to chant HK - Power of eg > Eg of power. Conversion of religions is eg of power.
                        SP love for Krishna inspired so much eb else. 
                            Leaders should eg and you don't. That's not purpose of this shloka.
                            We should be models and not critics - it is easy to be critics.
                        That will be bad eg and for all times to come ppl would quote Arjuna that he left battlefield.
                    22 - 1 more eg Krishna gives. There's no prescribed duties for me in 3 worlds cuz nth to gain or obtain yet I do prescribed duties.
                        matparah indicated b4 but here another hint.
                        when there are energies things happen like business power - press buttons and things happen.
                        SPOG - eth looks and naturally happens. Itch and scratch and reflex action happens for us.
                        So for Krishna eth he desires, happens automatically.
                    23 - If I don't do VA with attention then they would follow my eg.
                        Krishna acts in household life in Dwaraka.
                            welcoming visitors, charity, grievances, weddings, Brahmanas, etc
                            Narad M can fly capacity and another palace sees same thing - not that Krishna racing with him.
                            Krishna pervades place. Times were different in those palaces sw morning meditation or evening chores - Krishna controls not just space but also time.
                        But then why Krishna dances in Vrindavan with gopis - other men's wives.
                            that's abode of love. Didn't take any leadership position there.
                            active role in protecting citizens then nothing.
                            Vrindavan no leadership role and trans abode so no need for setting eg. Only eg of pure love - whatever intensifies love, Krishna does that.
                            Arena of dharma vs prema - Vrindavan is prema and others dharma.
                                Gs in Vrindavan also eg of Dharma - absorption in DS but of different kind.
                    24 - all worlds would be put to ruination if that and unwanted progeny.
                        society will crumble. Kshatriyas are protectful so Arjuna's concern and Krishna already concerned about that.
                        ungodly ppl and exploit women and unrighteousness will prevail and disastrous generations.
                        Butter stealing and rasa lila - great ppl are not to be imitated but admired.
                        SB Parikshit M asks same question 
                            and responded Suka G - no "Not God" should do such activities just like Lord Shiva's visha drinking can't be imitated.
                            Lord Shiva is topmost dev and didn't drink cuz didn't want to die but cuz didn't want poison to go close to Lord in heart.
                            Lord shiva's some followers drink bhang cuz they can't drink poison. It's tamasik - it leads to degrdation as told.
                        Great ppl manifestations do 2 phases - set good eg and others, that demonstrate position.
                            Eg - Lord Rama - maryada purushottam - but st establish position like Lord Krishna. We can't show universe in mouth. Meant to understand his supremacy.
                            violation of laws by great ppl or supreme shows supremacy to the laws.
                            If subordinate to laws then laws of supreme. Karma Mimamsa that laws of supreme ain't complete understanding
                            He doesn't need laws to regulate his lower self cuz he doesn't have lower self. We have lower self and need laws.
                            Krishna purely acts outta love, care and well being of e1.
                        rasa lila then first do govardhan lila.
                </KY2EgIfJYLevel>
                <KYvsKK>
                25-29 - KY-KK difference
                    25 - But I still get bound Arjuna asks - Even learned should act like that for setting eg.
                        like attached and ignored (KK) so should KY - consciosness difference but path is enlightenment.
                        KK folks need eg to emulate which KY would give.
                        Grihastas in HK meant serving in temple and detachment from society - eg of DS in society comes from practitioners.
                        not superior inferior - Brahmacaris and grihastas are 2 bregades in the same army of LCM.
                        Once HK movement probs of grihastas and sanyasis - SP yei Krsihna tattva vetta sei guru haya.
                        Brahmacaris meant to show vertical dimensions and Grihastas to show horizontal and vertical with balance. Grihamedhis see only horizontal.
                        So in progression eb plays a role. No renounced order then seems DS seems part time activity not full time.
                        Similarly no grihastas means DS not relatable that it could be done as well as material stuffs.
                    26 - Ignorant attached don't disrupt their minds.
                        SP engaged e1 - dovetailed all the talents like painters, etc.
                        can't come directly to Krishna then come slowly. I am renouncing outta sense of higher responsibility - ppl won't understand it.
                    27-32 - What does the "modes are the doers" mean?
                    27 - 3 modes doers and jiva thinks he is.
                        SP would quote this frequently.
                        If this is true then what's the point of BG?
                            Scriptures are contextual and it is to be understood - soul is 1 of the doers not only doer.
                            Soul is initiator of action. 
                            @Wood cutter - axe cuts it not hands and axe alone can't - both were important.
                            Soul has desire to speak and vocal cord, etc enable our speaking.
                            Passion to be driven - muscle and stamina for everest climbing - body or soul - body the tool governed by nature but soul has desires - gamut of choices determined by material nature.
                            MCQ with all wrong options how to choose - choose the best - MOG, MOP, MOI are all in forgetfulness of Krishna but gotta choose from them.
                            Prakriti pushes us to act in certain ways - we are impelled to act in certain ways.
                            Kshatriya's mind want to fight and vaishya can't stop thinking money - but all by dharmic means and engagements.
                            ishwar bhaav - quality talked by Krishna not in negative sense but positive - kshatriyas never run from battle etc - heroic and appreciated.
                                just a fact of nature. Dovetail in Krishna's service.
                            So understand that you are impelled to act in certain ways - run to forest is impelled by nature - dovetail your nature in service.
                    28 - knower of AT - action is being performed by the MMN.
                        I study shastra and be proud that I know so much. More than other people - then identifying with psychophysical nature and will cause me bondage.
                        Don't surrender to MMN and don't resist MMN based actions completely.
                        @I am trapped in a machine - computer our options become our default options. These defaults can be changed. But conscious effort to change that.
                        Acting as per defaults of the machine then slowly elevate.
                    29 - completely deluded by MMN - don't disturb them.
                        then you disrupt the gradual advancement of ppl.
                        KK is cycle of DAKM with M in the end after first 3 are done.
                        Social orders is maintained and given SG - even devs are given SG - nice music, food and association, Kirtan.
                            are these material pleasures or not spiritual - same tunes year after year and discriminate; same with prasadam - not bad - variety in spiritual world also.
                            the mood of bhakti is not to prove transcended faculty of taste so won't taste variety - that's not the mood of bhakti.
                            we want to spiritualize eth that we would do otherwise.
                            Our MMN play a role - dharmic people - big circle - para and apara - DAKM - Krishna is not the goal and means.
                        Don't rush people to higher level of renunciation - push to renunciation - can't do that and don't disturb them ppl says - hypocritical they may become if premature.
                        earlier days mistake of advacement in KC determined by ashram - but how much ashray is taken. Proud renunciate is not so good. Grihasta thinking my charity maintains them again problem.
                        Krishna ain't talking BY at all - He is saying don't push to JY in force. Set eg of acting in KY.
                        they may get attached, let them get attached else social order gets disturbed.
                        Devs are more merciful so they do - contradicting Krishna's will - no fulfilling - ultimately progress.
                            @Child can't be forced to home from hospital - Bahunam Janmamante - fast course of treatment is better - may involve more sacrifice - severe diet, exercise
                            maybe not e1 can do it and let them practice slow track - but offer fast track - nothing wrong.

                <HowKYElevates>
                30-35 - How KY elevates
                    30 - Surrender works to me with knowledge 
                        military discipline - just do it - no questions.
                            soldiers gotta follow - very serious question of life and death.
                            Spirituality is also very serious matter - not question of life and death but Eternal life vs repeated birth and death.
                        Devotional vs transcendental - we do devotional activities ed but transcending we are trying.
                            Practice in MOI can also practice devotional service but won't stay there anymore.
                        SP's purport is classic here.
                        Padyavali - desert needs water, flower needs sunshine - we need you O Lord.
                        Feverish - vigata jvara - mania - like wearing T-shirt of their stars.
                            MMN doesn't come with proclamation and they are coming - they come in attractive forms like mania of attractice shoes, etc.
                            This fever of material infatuation. Physically lulled and mentally dulled by grats.
                            Conscious of eating then body signals but other things while eating then don't realize when it's done.
                            Commercials tell us buy this and that - so as to shop - addiction of shopaholics.
                            Social trends worth observing. Ads influence as if we can't live without them.
                            Fight is prescribed duty and overcome by frenzy of world - stay away from that.
                            I come and go with nothing why waste time in acquiring.
                            Socrates - you into shopping - I observe unnecessities ppl shop.
                    31 - Those who execute duties and follow this teaching - free from bondage of fruitive actions.
                        even if unable to execute orders still liberated - not resentful and works sincerely.
                        can't practice principle is ok but don't resent the principle - anya abhilashita shunyam for eg is heard.
                        gradually they will come to the principle - don't lose hope if can't chant properly.
                        similarly wth following 4 regs - don't resent the principles and try following to best of capability.
                    32 - To those are faithless unlike previous verse - deluded knowledge and ruined endeavors.
                        isolation and self centered enjoyment then can't be happy.
                        Atheist philosophers - most in last century by end of life went mad and even commit suicides.
                            1 quote - no god, no soul, life is all that we have and it is full of suffering - how terrible world view gloomy.
                            Only question is to commit suicide tomorrow or today.
                    33-36 - 2 mis-quoted verse fragments from the Gita
                        earlier KY was just detachment from work and then offer work to SPOG.
                    33 - e1 acts by their nature. What will suprression do?
                        contradictory verse to what we do - repression of anarthas.
                        what's talked is not anarthas but propensities in VA - some urges to be rejected and some are dovetailed.
                        Prakriti vs Vaasana
                            Material nature - innate of our psychophysical nature and harmonizable with dharma.
                            Material Desire - superficial to our psychophysical nature and not harmonizable with dharma.
                            For brahmana to think intellectually is natural and not sinful; similarly contact of soul with body may have kshatriya mentality.
                            Shudra lower cuz no sense control - brahmana life of cleanliness and purity - by qualities but not birth
                            shudra can also evolve thru PDS - even guru he can become. Internal purification and even external role taking - both are possible says LCM.
                        Some so called spiritualists private lack of self control and don't reveal.
                        Some institutions make this verse as essence of BG - nigrah kim karishyati - so indulge in desires. Misleading e1.
                            go to context - sinful tendency control Krishna has been talking. By what one is impelled to sin asks Arjuna and Krishna says lust is eternal enemy.
                            Act according to nature is what Krishna says.
                            comfortable internally and competent externally should be service.
                        Surrender doesn't mean that doing what I don't like to do - KC is not about making ourselves miserable.
                            it's a mistake in sentiment - Krishna wants us to be happy - should not id with material nature completely.
                            VA continued and do sadhana and advance gradually.
                        We can't determine our varna by birth - born in business family but does sth else - individual self discovery is reqd - what's my psychophysical nature.
                            currently ppl just do work whatever is available - lack of job satisfction is an observation.
                            but don't postpone KC to understand our material nature.
                    34 - raag and dvesh are enemies.
                        Can't suppress nature previous verse but now vaasana is talked here.
                        Male and female attraction should be regulated - expressed in regulation - can't repress the expression so regulate.
                        Baladev V - Dvesh from sadhus who say against raag.
                        In conditioned state, we have chanting and hearing as prescribed duties but ESMD are our pastimes - looks forward to them.
                        But in KC, naturally reluctant to such propensities.
                        Marriage gives protection - purpose of marriage isn't SG but better service - if forgotten then intel burn and license for deviation
                            there are accidents even on royal road - desires blaze then safeguards won't stop us.
                            Necessity for not soul but conditioned soul - not physical but psychophysical necessity.
                            no1 dies without sex. not e1 renounced and not e1 needs to.
                            happiness in spiritual level - in initial stages not possible to have stream of happiness in steady and fulfilling way.
                                basic need is happiness - get it in spiritual life then not dependent on material life.
                                So, dharmic marriage is suggested for most people.
                        Suffering is cuz of our attachment many think - no, our suffering is cuz of our detachment.
                            detachment from Krishna. Bhakti is not devp detachment but rectify our detachment from Krishna thru attachment.
                            not too much focussed on material attachments but on Krishna attachment.
                            guilty in spiritual life - nth is happening - that guilt could be a temptation - anything that takes us away from Krishna.
                                a wall created that self centered and not Krishna centered.
                                guilt - like immune system - fever is sign for medicine need - feeling of sickness should not make us think that medicine is useless 
                                    anything unfavorable or discourages us in bhakti - put it aside.
                                BVT - amara jivan sada paperat didn't end with so let me indulge in material life.
                                @focus not on removing darkness but turning on light.
                        3.33 middle way - regulated expression in KY
                            If we only do things that we like to do
                                we will get a strong sense of doership
                                we will never learn to discipline our mind and so won't develop taste for the core devotional activities.
                            so also do services that we are not as per our nature.
                    35 - one's prescribed duties is better imperfect than other's prescribed duty.
                        LIC - yogakshema vahamyaham.
                        Some hindu orgs - to get ppl who are converted. Agitated by christian conversions.
                            homecoming thru para dharma bhayavah - dharma doesn't talk about religions 
                            Krishna's time religions didn't exist and even hindu vocab didn't exist - that came some 100 years back.
                            Ppl moved outta vedic fold coming back is good in a sense.
                            Abrahamic religions like christianity and islam are exclusivistic religion - their way is only way.
                            is it based on scriptures - not entirely - I am the way by christ is for that time.
                            @Doctor - forget whatever doctor told you what follow what I tell you to do - comparison can also be done if reqd.
                            Other religions with this attitude of exclusivism think of all other religions as false.
                            We understand Christ and Krishna are same - but some christians christ is true and Krishna is false god - so reject false god.
                            Biblical conquest in past - destory places of worship - destroyed false gods.
                                they don't just give it up but negative feeling or hatred towards that. This is unfortunate and undesirable.
                            Who's better demigod worshipper or christian - SP - demigod worshipper is better cuz lesser conceptual and cultural barriers to come to KC.
                                deities are worshipped vs desecrated.
                                christians a few accept also but by far few.
                                can't take this as blanket statement - that neo demigod worshipper vs very sincere advanced christian saint.
                                ultimate criteria is aspiring for love of god and advancing or not.
                            antithetical becoming for vedic culture then yes it's contextually true but BG statement is not spoken with that intent.
                        There are exceptions like Parashuram and Vishvamitra but very few.
                        Nishkama doesn't make karma into yoga - connection does.

                <OvercomeLustKYObstacle>
                36-43 - Overcome Lust, the main obstacle on the path of KY.
                    36 - why does one dwell and moves to sin. Even if outside of desire.
                        flow of thought is yes we should do our duties but there's aversion from it cuz of sin - where does it come from.
                        can we engage in sin without our desire - temptations come and we say yes to those desires.
                        overall desire - intellect is not contaminated - temporary desire becomes suddenly desirable.
                        BG this section is very desirable from even common ppl.
                            People may not know or care soul - but how we act and get sabotaged by desires - passion of lust for eg and even intoxicating addictions.
                    37-40 - How the enemy of lust covers us
                    37 - MOP it comes from and it solidifies into wrath.
                        We are parts and parcels of bliss. ananda in sat cit ananda pointed.
                        disconnected enjoyment - we seek where it's not there and causes bondage.
                        brahma jijnasa vs indriya tripti jijnasa - hopes of sth better in SG. Happiness not available in any.
                        not as enjoyable as expected - only bhakti channel can make us happy - not TV channel itself, it's the connection with Krishna - proper sources then can watch them.
                        it's not idle enquiry? serious that nth of world gives happiness - eth is anti climax.
                        realization doesn't stay cuz of worldly promises advertised so much.
                        SP - hippies thought of as frustrated; but it's good to identify that.
                            US became prosperous after WW2 - casualties very less and weapons selling means money.
                            so all material dreams - all fulfilled by that generation - but didn't fulfill.
                            So started getting into drugs and couldn't get out - some were really sincere.
                        Origin of lust is also in supreme - attraction in male female comes from there - misdirected here.
                            it is misdirection of our search for happiness.
                            Lust goes outta control and can blind a person - homo, bi, paedophilia, incest, ?3some etc.
                            Rapes etc all originate in lust - ppl don't see the link - what they smilingly watch in media and what they horrifyingly watch in the news.
                            sexually explicitly promoting of male female sexuality - ppl look forward to those kinda depictions in media but horrified but the same force.
                            Movies show consensual sex but that's good and this is bad - but blinding by lust is being ignored - it can take ugly forms there.
                            Cultural and morality helps from going bad but ppl have too high a self image. !Eg - Ajamila.
                            Ajamila would be shocked if 7 would tell him that this would happen 1 month b4.
                        @enemy - which is not physical - how does it fight.
                    38 - Fire covered by smoke, mirror by dust, womb covers embryo so is jiva covered by lust.
                        @Fire Smoke - Human - thin and penetrable.
                        @Dust mirror - animals - thick and tough to penetrate. Effort to remove the dirt.
                        @Womb child - super thick and penetrable only after long effort. Can't come out - after lots of effort in time.
                        Lust is a thing or feeling - Krishna talking as thing - lusty impressions in mind and lusty desires triggered in mind (sanskar and vritti)
                        internet porn - so thing in mind provokes us (subtle and real), feeling gets activated.
                        Male female attraction then agitation. Impressions !=> don't force us to act. Obscenes can't be avoided and wearing provocative - external can be avoided and internal can also be avoided.
                        Maya - avarnatmika and prakshepatmika - covers (reality) and pushes (drags to illusion)
                            @Movies - turning lights off to forget reality and movie showing is pushing to illusion.
                    39 - eternal enemy. Burns like fire.
                        Kills once but eternal enemy doesn't go away with life.
                        goes lifetime after lifetime 
                        Enemy worst in identity, strategy and longevity - all these ways.
                            lifetimes after lifetimes.
                            identity - don't come to know about it - those who didn't fulfill my lust are the problems.
                            Strategy - spy into enemy ranks then dangerous - subotages our efforts.
                                Lust uses our force to defeat us. STD diseases.
                                @Virus in computer - it uses our space, electricty and OS tech resources, etc to defeat us.
                            Eg - Ajamila cultured person gone.
                        Romantic movies also heart burn fire - saavan jo aag lagaye; my heart is on fire.
                            indulgence aggravates the fire - not satiates it as they wrongly think.
                            lust can't be fulfilled. Marriage will also aggravate it - how is it gonna purify us.
                            It's not indulgence in grihastashram that gives purification but observation of dharma there.
                            grihamedhi is license for gratification. Higher happiness.
                            dissatisfied with one partner then goes to others and extramarital, premarital if hankering, etc.
                            fuels with indulgence just blazes it more.
                            @maithuna agara - shackles to jivas. binds soul to the body - need apparatus to fulfill thru body.
                            advancement of material life in terms of SG is only increasing of duration of material existence.
                            earlier gotta go sw for grats but now porns - perverse ideas made into movies and all those impressions go inside.
                            Porn addiction is serious addiction with probs when over indulgence.
                            My Engg - interest in Science - Mechanisms and principles into how things work.
                            If I help ppl with their idiot box then I am an idiot. ESMD promotion - entertainment and defense industry.
                            there may be some feeling of happiness (exaggeration in ads) but that so called is ultimate enemy of jiva.
                                @Mouse trap - cheese and it gets trapped - some pleasure is eating that cheese but gone is the freedom. Not worth it.
                                @Fish - dragged to happiness.
                                Drinking enjoyment but an enemy.
                                Some think Moral values are relative - the complications and consequences are not relative but real - AIDS with unprotected sex is not relative.
                                Obnoxios - it's bad cuz noxious (poisonous) - not a value judgment based on outdated morals of past (cuz they believed)
                                    abominable and obnoxious - not moral judgment - it is poisonous.
                                    Vish and Vishaya - consumption vs just contemplation so vishay is more dangerous.
                    40 - In senses, mind, intel and deludes the soul.
                        lust in not in female form or dress - provoked, baby doesn't get agitated touching private parts of mother.
                        lust is provoked thru form but present in our own senses, mind, and intel.
                        blaming the victim - male violated the female then prob with male - prosti still no license.
                        But also, The way we dress sends messages to others - that's psychological - provocative clothes is sending message - I want to be seen as sex object.
                            this question women can ask themselves if that's the message they wanna send to others.
                        Walking in dark alley - carrying 1K notes coming outta pockets - gets robbed - police chastises the victim why have money coming outta pocket.
                            Hey it's my money and my right to keep it that way. Yes, it's not quesetion of legal rights.
                            From legal perspective yes the thieves were wrong and they should be punished for forcibly taking money.
                            it's not criminally culpable or not - common sense - is it what I want?
                                If money is revealing, ppl will want to look for opportunity to rob.
                            This is common sense. Making this common sense issue into complicated moral right issue just muddies the discussion.
                            Women reveal provocative parts then it results in sending messages
                            No I want to keep showing my money out of my pocket but no1 should steal me then it's not gonna work.
                            Many may not want to send that message - maybe just see me as attractive with mouth open but not touch me.
                                the message are bound to be sent in any case.
                        responsibility lies in both sides.
                    40-43 Intelligence saves us from becoming willing captives of lust
                    40 - St intelligence used to fulfill the wishes of mind.
                        methodical madness - plans to brutally attack the victims.
                        private SG - no1 should find out - why lust find me out?
                        we enjoy intelligently - material enjoyment that is.
                        So don't trust your intelligence too much in initial stages - corroded intelligence in contact with SO.
                        normal life we gotta use intelligence how to travel - activities which are dangerous - like prolonged contact with SO - woman association for teaching.
                        Eg - saving baby dear was benevolent for bharat M but got attached to it was the problem.
                            sathana < deer. Intelligence led him in wrong direction.
                        SP - strategy is very important in warfare - lust takes place in senses, mind and intellect.
                            lust is in eyes - means - not a physical location. Faculty of sight - inferred that it is going in wrong direction.
                            SUP by products of body and land is worshippable - go khara. asses are unintelligent. Cow is considered holy. Krishna loves cows.
                                still cows are in subhuman species. Gentle and loving but put under illusion. Calf taken away - milk pouring outta udders.
                                Animal body and can go under illusion.
                                when buddhi is contaminated then such problems come.
                                We think of lust as wrong activities - from SB perspective all these acts were good (patriot and going to pilgrimage but strict stand)
                    41 - how to conquer it - begin with intel. Regulate senses.
                        Bull becomes wild and stampede. Sports exciting cuz bulls are hostile - not on pussy cat.
                        Bharat rishabh - bull among bharat dynasty. Heroism by overcoming lust. Unlike bollywood - indulgence is heroic - defeating enemies to save woman.
                        heroism to protect someone but also ourselves and others from lust.
                        Polygamy allowed but Arjuna refused Urvashi. So sense control. Not just fight to get desires fulfilled.
                        Movie vs Ramayan - hero, heroine, villain all same - movie both hero and villain both have enjoying mentality and illusion of body grats - morally wrong so material morality.
                            even morally wrong hero st but - ppl say it's ok when consensual.
                            consensus can't be used to describe what's right then jews killed in German in WW2 was right.
                            Creator must have retired after making you sita - similarly tareef karun kya uski jisne tujhe banaya.
                        Slay the destroyer for realization and urge of realization - urge for SR is gone with lust - don't feel like cuz enjoyable.
                            So some difficulties are reqd voluntarily - happy in prison. Impetus for final goal.
                            Kuvera Resorts - Pandavas left the Kuvera's comforts so that their purpose is not lost.
                            Protected culture then can't go out - KC is so powerful that late beginner can also come to perfection.
                            Garbhadan sanskar and from kaumaram we should ideally start.
                    42 - SO < Senses < Mind < Intel < Soul < Super Soul.
                        fridge food doesn't come to us so SO are dead.
                        Senses also no life but active due to soul's presence.
                        Mind dreams about SG so lives far more. Dream mind still active.
                            central point where all inputs come to.
                            reins control horses.
                        Intel - feel like doing but won't do cuz of ramification - curb those feelings.
                            charioteer controls the horses.
                            this normal hierarchy but powerful horses can drag horse elsewhere.
                        Soul is energy for the appartus - gets things moving.
                            goal should be clear.
                        Problem is senses to SO is very strong force - gravity. That's natural cuz of defaults.
                            something should stop it - regulation is first thing - man woman attraction then within limits of marriage.
                            can't think of spiritual truths cuz finishes the urge for SR.
                            upward connection is also important.
                    43 - thus with intel, know to be trans. steady the mind by deliberate intel. Conquer lust.
                        soul goes beyond pull of lust - spiritual happiness then can't be conquered by lust.
                        Lust is flower beginning but pierces later - Cuupid's arrow symbolized - heart pierced by arrow.
                        Conclusion of chapter is connection with super soul.
                        @Not hooked to sth higher then bound to get dragged to lower.
                        Krishna has suggested thus 2 solutions - regulate and transcend. Restraint (no SR with it) and Redirect (thru intel)
                        Not give up but engage in KY.

            </Ch3>
            <Ch4>
                Gita press calls it Jnana Karma sannyasa yoga - karma sanyas yoga is 5th chapter. SP calls is transcendental knowledge.
                Theme is centered on knowledge. Nth pure like it.
                connection to previous chapter - dharma is what protects jiva from kaam.
                1-10 - Krishna teaches and establishes dharma.
                1-6 - How Krishna teaches and restored spiritual knowledge.
                    1 - I gave knowledge to sun god.
                        where sun god comes into discussion suddenly? The knowledge that I have given isn't spun from head but existed since the time of sun god.
                            responsibility of not just citizens but also the kings - the responsibles.
                            sun god is very important deity in the universe.
                        socially effective spirituality <= adopted by brahmanas and kshatriyas in union
                            Buddhism took off with Ashoka. Christianity was prosecuted until kings adopted.
                            Pratap rudra influenced society.
                            Lenin and Stallin made communism get its hold for 70 years.
                            Kings affect society. SP would like leaders - this is not discrimination but precision.
                            News - SP invites hippies - influenced those who were degraded from material standards, to speak nothing of vedic standards.
                                Allen Ginsberg forward book earlier but not later - famous but scandalous statements. Hare Krishna is movement open to hippies but not labelled as such - so shrewd presentation.
                            @Lifeguards are trained to save wounded first those with more chance of getting saved.
                                This is prioritization not discrimination.
                            HK is for wealthy or educated - not true! pada yatra ppl go from village to village. Educated should also be included - they affect other sections of society.
                                Temples stay open for everybody - no guard sits at gate checking for their certificates b4 entry - at least graduate!
                                And if sb wants to know how to practice spiritual life - devs are there to help them.
                    2 - Why the need to repeat it - knowledge comes thru parampara system.
                        raj rishayo viduh - seem to be different kinda ppl - controller of external world vs internal world.
                            These 2 things integrated well into a person is royal sage or saintly king (rishi raj)
                            not power hungry kings but serve and share their character with others.
                        It has gone down with time not specific people - that's how eth happens.
                            constant effort is required for positive transformation, negative randomness is natural.
                            BG commentaries may be respectable in their own right - their interpretation is way off track - non violence it speaks but very few verses vs yoga, yuddha, etc.
                                non violence is good and recommended for brahmanas but not the prime message.
                                other commentators - we didn't follow BG properly else Pakistan would have been viped - Arjuna fight.
                                They wrote brains from book - if commenting on a book then do it properly - your own book is ok but writing commentary is responsible.
                                @Link of speaker and audience is thru translator - if your own class starts - Krishna is SPOG by speaker vs Brahman is AT by translator.
                                    1 person who understands raises voice - hey don't shout in spiritual gathering shanti shanti. Intolerant, Don't criticise - it's nonsense.
                                    translator has right to give their own class in their audience but not like this.
                                Congress was Krishna and British was kaurava army to be wiped.
                                1 european scholar after studying all commentaries - such profound wisdom that it's incomprehensive.
                                    but if you study it fairly it doesn't have a message. Ambiguous some places but precise overall.
                    3 - that science I tell you today cuz devotee and friend and cuz of that you can understand.
                        uttama - takes one outta darkness.
                        qualification required for eth - ticket collector - MIT topper or sanskrit topper doesn't help with BG.
                        finite can know infinite only when infinite reveals - attracted thru bhakti.
                    4 - you are recently born so how did you speak to sun god.
                        content of question vs mood of question. 125 yrs old both.
                            I spoke this to my grandfather.
                            doubt is there - gotta deal with it. If not A then seek B to answer it for deeper understanding.
                            How am I to understand is the mood.
                    5 - Both of us had past.
                        Scope of question needs to be expanded - reincarnation and previous avatar.
                        on same chariot but there is a world of difference - Krishna never forgets.
                        Memories are in brain with reference and mind for data - forgetting file path and file name also.
                            we tend to forget and memory wipers BODD - cuz traumatic experiences.
                    6 - I appear every millenium.
                        by his own arrangement he comes - prakriti remains under his control
                        @PM or president doesn't come under jail if he makes a visit.
                        we can't see spiritual form - Krishna reveals - virat svarupa he shows some times.
                        shishupal was not alone - cediraj and others were also there in abusing.
                            so many can't understand.
                    7-10 - what does understand Krishna tattvatah mean
                    7 - tension in dharma and adharma side. good dog and bad dog in USA.
                        good and bad - gotta refer scriptures for that.
                        dharma word is multivalent - sarva dharman paritjyajna so how give up what's constitutional.
                            dharma - DAKM - material dharma or svadharma. this is social order.
                            sadhana bhakti is not eternal dharma but transitional dharma.
                            spiritual level of dharma is eternal.
                        Here Krishna is talking about social dharma not others.
                        srijami - gets created? no. Just like kaam word is used for rasa lila - but it relieves of kaam.
                            form is not created but manifests.
                            we have a baggage so connotations are used.
                        himself, son or servant or disguised - Krishna, Jesus, Buddha, LCM.
                        why only 1 way to him - that's very narrow from loving father
                        religious differences - esoteric ideas differ - offering prayer is same so different externals but internals are same - offering prayer and respect and devotion.
                    8 - to deliver pious and annihilate miscreates I come. And restablish religion.
                        adharmic ppl grab power and persecute dharmic people.
                        Eg - rishis and demigods troubled by Ravana.
                        rakshasas are cannibals - ate up sages in Ravana's time.
                        primary purpose of Lord is to satisfy devs.
                        sanatan G was primarily taught about avatars.
                        avatar meaning - avatarati - manifest in material world.
                            types - purusa, guna, lila, saktyaves, manvantara, yuga.
                            purusa - vishnus - purusa and prakriti - consciousness and material nature - with process of creation.
                            guna - trinity - tridev. MOG, MOP, MOI.
                            lila - for pastimes. may or may not teach yuga dharmas.
                                Krishna not yugavatar - told in beginning not end - although gave to uddhava.
                            shaktyavesh - empowered personnel.
                            manvantara - every millenia or interval to establish dharma.
                            yuga - to establish yuga dharma.
                    9 - dharma karma ca me divyam. come back to me if you know it truly.
                        frequency of SP quoting this is quite high.
                            God is not supporter of our pastimes but we supporting his pastimes.
                            so ppl like restoring dharma idea of Krishna.
                        terms of trans
                            terrestrial - earthly
                            celestial - anything above like heaven.
                            transcendental - above material realm.
                        entertainment - nice to see talks about child but Krishna is beyond that.
                            Krishna appeared with royalty and vishnu forms with 4 arms - not genetic mutation but power.
                                @PM's child is playing - position of person doing action makes a big difference. Stealing butter is small thing otherwise.
                            Idea of God of britishers changed from punisher from above there - God stealing butter and small boy - he doesn't have to. Intellectual short circuiting.
                                God doesn't have to - puts from one place to another is not stealing
                                butter pot is also inside him in virat rupa. eth belongs to him - changing places. has literally nothing to do in that sense
                                but the purpose is to attract the devs.
                            @Metaphor of drama - yogamaya is director and scriptwriter sb and Krishna is the hero.
                                scriptwriter is Krishna himself. Krishna is not in control but he is in control.
                                Krishna is method actor - really feeling the emotions in the drama. running to protect himself.
                                Krishna can remember and forget when he wants - like when damodar lila he remembers my devotee narada's words - so he remembers not forgetting eth in drama.
                                with krishna tattva amazing from being just amusing otherwise.
                                oxymoron - yoga maya. chaste prostitute. courageous coward. intelligent fool.
                                    chanting not but seeing others - worldly maya. Spiritual maya - forget Krishna's godhood.
                                    Yashoda M can't love Krishna that intensely if remembers Krishna is supreme maintainer.
                                        back of the mind it is known like stars exist in daytime also but sun daylight hides them.
                                        Proof - gopi geet - We know you have appeared on brahma's wish.
                                        Krishna likes uninhibited love - not affected by his position.
                11-15 - Krishna is the goal and creator of all paths.
                    11-13 - How Krishna reciprocates with different people.
                    11 -
                16-24 - KY as dharma.
                25-33 - Achieving jnana thru sacrifices
                34-42 - Glory of Divya jnana

                        Dh - what they did?
                        S - 
                                Observing Armies
                                        Du spoke Dr - Drupad arranged army in opposition; estimating their strengths. estimating our strengths and arts. comparing leaders. call for supporting leaders.
                                        Bhishma conch lion like. e1 enthu. Pandavas conch - strong uproar shattering opposition.
                                        Arjuna observed and spoke to Krishna - let me see analyse opposition (who's who) - Krishna did that.
                                Lamentation over future prospects
                                        Arjuna sees teachers, relatives, friends, etc => compassion & "cause for misfortune" => quivering limbs/ trembling body, drying mouth, burning skin, hair on end, bow slipping, reeling mind.
                                        evaluation - killing them + weight of "good" - I don't want that good.
                                                good for whom - we kill them. Of course, they can kill me.
                                                even 3 worlds isn't worth reward at price of killing them. Killing aggressors - ain't that big pleasure. ...Even without them don't care to live (later)
                                                        any gain you see?
                                                Sin of killing them - their greed won't let them see likewise but we do.
                                                Irreligion rise - Dynasty destruction => no family traditions => irreligion => polluted women => unwanted progeny => hellish family and society (no community projects and family welfare) & future hellish prospects.
                                                        ancestors fall down.
                                                        all this for our own sake of royalty. Better to kill me unarmed than to have this loss for little selfish gain.
                                        Arjuna puts bow aside and sits down in grief, depressed, tears in eyes.
                                Krishna chastises - lost clarity. Infamy in near future not higher planets in long term. (High level veredict)
                                        heart weakness => degradation => give it up. (current course has less + and more -)
                                Arjuna analyses more
                                        other course is attack worshippable personalities.
                                        with current course I don't mind being a begger, than killing them (- of both courses compared)
                                        they may desire worldly gain but they are superiors but I can't stand that + of other course for the price.
                                        what's vision (ideal desired end state) is not clear - at least can decide to win or lose accordingly.
                                        I am confused (not in straight mind to evaluate), please guide me what's best, I surrender.
                                        veredict - I won't fight even for sake of heaven in return of this cost.
                                Krishna smiling - learned words but lamenting unjust (for living, dead)
                                        analytical thoughtflow
                                                All of us always existed. Like internal reincarnation there's external one also. Worldly dualities pass through => tolerate => !disturbance => liberation.
                                                body nothing remains and soul nothing is lost. Indestructible vs body sure end. Life force is not slayer or slain (only material manifestations).
                                                Soul is eternal (unborn, ever-existing). Think of body change like clothes.
                                                Soul is non-material - water doesn't moisten, fire doesn't burn, weapons can't cut, wind can't wither, unbreakable, insoluble, unchangable, immovable.
                                                Soul invisible, inconceivable, immutable. So, don't grieve for body.
                                                If you believe soul tenure only in life - then death is sure ; so why avoid duty discharge for it. Unmanifest once again like they were b4.
                                                Soul attitudes - looks amazing, speak amazing, sounds amazing, means nothing.
                                                Body dwelling is destroyed so don't grieve. (@burning fire to house)
                                                Duty as kshatriya => fighting on religious principles => !hesitation.
                                                        such opportunity for fortunates => heavens.
                                                        neglect these duties => sin => losing reputation as fighter or infamy => worse than death (for respectable).
                                                                left battlefield <= fear => you are insignificant => unkind words and scorn ur abilities => painful.
                                                With proposed course, (lose => heaven, win => earthly kingdom) => fight with determination.
                                                        fight for sake sake of it (without dualities) => !sin (cuz not for self gain)
                                        Karmic thought flow - (answers the doubt on sin from killing question)
                                                working w/o fruitive results => !bondage.
                                                no loss in trying, little progress => !fear.
                                                resolute intel, 1 aim, unlike others n-branched.
                                                fruitive acts => birth, power, elevation to heaven realm, etc. <= attachments => no resolute determination, controlled mind.
                                                3 MMN in Vedas, transcend them. no dualities (that's yoga), established in self.
                                                @reservoir serves purposes of all wells - purpose behind eth in vedas.
                                                right over duty not results entitlement. Duty !=> results (alone) but also don't stop duty. (@carpenter ain't owner)
                                                intel => !abominable acts. Fruits of works enjoyer => miser (mentality, small minded)
                                                yoga => freedom from sinful reactions even in this life.
                                                        yoga => freedom from results of work => libration from COBD (cycle of birth and death) => no miseries.
                                                        forest delusion gone => intel free and you indifferent to heard b4 and to be.
                                                        KK no disturbance + fixed in self realization => divine consciousness.
                                Arjuna - symptoms of such sthitaprajna. speaks, lang, sits, walks. (in order to implement the karmic part of no sin theorem)
                                Krishna - Mental waves => desires for grats. Purified => satisfaction in self => sthitaprajna.
                                        dualities stimuli -> !disturbance => steady determination.
                                        dualities response -> !praise or despise => situated in perfect knowledge.
                                        SO -> !withdraw senses => firm in perfect consciousness.
                                        !SO but Mental sanskars -> !engagements <= higher taste -> fixed consciousness.
                                        Power of senses - carry the mind - although strong intel discrimination.
                                                but control & consciousness on Krishna => steady intel.
                                        contemplation SO -> attachment -> lust -> anger -> delusion (illusion, !tattvatah vision) -> bewildered memory (forgetting) -> intel lost (discrimination).
                                                but control senses thru regulations & freedom from attachments and aversions => mercy of lord => !3 fold miseries => satisfied consciousness -> well established intel.
                                                !Supreme consciousness => !transcendental intel & !steady mind => !peace => !happiness.
                                                1 roaming sense focus - can carry away mind like strong wind from any side. SO <--> senses restrain - is steady intel.
                                                night for all - day for self controlled and vv.
                                                river of desires enter into ocean of person (but already full and still not affected) => peace & strive for fulfill every desire => !peace.
                                        !desires for grats, !proprietorship, !false ego => real peace.
                                        Brahman => !bewilderment. Brahman absorption at death => nirvana attainment.
                                Arjuna - wait, why fruitive fight if steady intel is better. Why engage at all - decision which is better.
                                Krishna - 2 classes of men (jnani and karmi)
                                        !work !=> !reaction. (sanyas ain't enough).
                                        MMN => work. 
                                                !work but MMN force mind to dwell => pretender.
                                                vs karma yoga without attachment - active senses but controlled mind
                                                Prescribed duties - better than no work. can't even maintain life without it.
                                                        sacrifice for vishnu else bondage. gives happy life and liberation. demigods pleased => necessities -> offering them in return else thief (sin).
                                                        Prescribed duties => yajna => Rains => grains => subsistence.
                                                        Trascendence -> Vedas -> Prescribed Duties => Lord is situated in such sacrifices.
                                                        vs living for senses - life in vain and sinful.
                                                (later 33) - repression can't stop one's nature (acquired from MMN)
                                                        own duty imperfectly is better than other's duty perfectly - dangerous to follow another's path.
                                        even if SR then shouldn't mind work - for self realized there is no prescribed duty.
                                                no purpose to fulfill. He has no reason to not do it. doesn't depend on anyone else.
                                        so best course work without attachment -> supreme.
                                                Eg - Janaka Maharaj.
                                        great man acts, common men follow.
                                                no prescribed work for me yet I act in prescribed duties. else ppl take my eg and put to ruination => unwanted population => !peace.
                                                Like other common men, learned also work but without attachments and leading others on right path.
                                                don't induce others to stop their frutive work but engage them.
                                                        Absolute Truth knowledge => no engagement in senses and grats - cuz that's work in fruitive mentality.
                                                        vs MMN => work => results <= attached. But don't stop them - their lack of knowledge here.
                                        work as offering - full knowledge, no desire for profit, claim to proprietorship, no lethargy => !bondage.
                                                envy -> disregard (cuz lack of knowledge) => ruined endeavor for perfection.
                                                regulate attachment and aversion - not under control that's stumbling block in SR.
                                        MMN referenced again.
                                Arjuna - y impelled to act sinfully as if by force.
                                Krishna - MOP association => lust => wrath
                                        degrees of lust coverings - smoke on fire, mirror by dust, embryo in womb.
                                        eternal enemy of pure consciousness is lust - never satiates and burns like fire.
                                        living places - senses, mind, inel - covers real knowledge and bewilders.
                                        so, nip in the bud thru regulation and slay it.
                                                Matter <- Senses <- Mind <- Intel <- Soul.
                                                So, conquer lust thru spiritual strength and spiritual intelligence.
                                Krishna - (let's talk about work in devotion...)
                                Arjuna - please tell definitely what's better - renunciation or work with devotion.

                    Preface - why one more edition, SP credentials, what is KC.
                            no adulteration, KC is essential.
                    Intro
                            Spirit of BG - only scirpture directly by God, accept as is, how to know krishna is god.
                                    @take medicine as prescribed.
                            who - meant for dev or at least theoretical acceptance of Krishna as god.
                            why - love, btg, revive svarupa 5 rasas, freedom from material anxieties.
                            how - BY, SPOG theoretically, submission, Disciplic succession, accept Lord without contradicting, read carefully.
                            what - deliver mankind form nescience, realize suffering and find solutions.
                                    5 basic subjects.
                                    epistemology - all vedic knowledge is infallible. destination is spiritual sky.
                            Parampara - Gaudiya - Radharani worship - introduced by Madhvacharya kalpa vriksha in Spiritual world. Brahma is original SM, narada preaches to all kinds of people (champion preacher).
                                    Vyasadev - Krishna as compiler of scriptures, all prominent personalities. Madhvacharya - deity worship and mayavad khandan (impersonalism) - bhima and hanuman.
                                    ishwarpuri - LCM (another speciality that lord comes here), 6Gs personalities, Vidyabhushan (commentary on vedanta sutra) - by Lord himself; SP - 12 yrs KC in whole world.
                                    why - value of pearls b4 gifted; khandan ki izzat ka savaal hai; give us motivation to study this knowledge (the later the better) more understandable.

                                                    attitude towards authority (?culture)
                                                    mood and mission - content but intent behind it is important. Reading not just the book but author.
                            confusion, frustration, desperation help spirituality.
                                    existential bitterness - what is the cause behind this.
                                    1 prob that causes other probs - dehatma buddhi. @prisoner thinking himself as PM of country and all other probs come.
                                    medicine to diseased mind - killer of daityendra (lust).

                                            whatever connected to Krishna is very satisfying - although war scene but fulfills all our desires.

                                            Fall in love with these characters and mentally picturize and being in association of them.
                                            Best Movie zooming - home, war scene, 2 people situated on chariot.
                                    signs of victory
                                            madhava, divya shankha, Kapi dhwaja, 
                                            Arjuna so powerful - quiver and arrow from indra never finishes, agni chariot, training from horse handling from gandharvas, krishna as charioteer.
                                            so excited to fight is like celebrations. Demigods also watching this war.
                                            Materialist is coward but shows confidence - so devs should be confident trained.
                                            Gorakhas science of warcry that shatters the opposite army.
                                    Krishna and bhakta vatsala - how the hero is introduced as servant of devs.
                                            Let me see - like markandeya - curiosity kills the cat.
                                            hrishikesh is guided to take life - virodhabhas.
                                            gudakesh - not sleep in japa. Committed to excellence is Arjuna. Conquerer of illusion by keeping Krishna in heart.
                                            Krishna or paramatma brings body to situations that are turbulent for BG to be spoken or be relevant to us.
                                            culture that so many names for different feels but english one word - cousin, that's it.
                                    Arjuna's doubts - CSDEI - Compassion, sinful reactions, Destruction of family traditions, Enjoyment material loss, Indecision.
                                            Arjuna has all good qualities but can't handle some issues without teacher. Eth gonna happen opposite to what I want - eb has their stories.
                                            misdirected self interest - ref to I and mine.
                                            relatives don't let me practice KC - they are relative. Arjuna advised to kill but guts to practice our priorities in life.
                                            janardan is sarcastic - why telling me to kill.
                                            Govinda - we are meant to serve Krishna's sense not other way.
                                            madhava - kshatriya vs bandhava - dharma sankat.
                                                    dharma shastra to forgive. Niti shastra to kill aggressors.
                                                    what kula will duryodhana do who can disrobe draupadi in kings assembly.
                                            Rajputs - kshatranis self emolument - wombs not polluted by these kings so destory that facility.
                                            seems that community project and welfare are important.
                                            gandiva is like determination to fight - dropped when overwhelmed with shoka.
                                            Govinda! I will not chant my japa. Disease badaa hai aur medicine lene ka plan nahi hai (dehatma buddhi and I won't fight)

                                    content specific questions - are directly answered.
                                    Generic questions - theological applications - that incident happened there - speak sth from the chapter.
                                            philosophical speculation but not mental speculation.
                                    3 tendencies - Exploitation, calculation, engagement - gross exploited in KY; subtle exploited is DY; Calculation to avoid misery and vv - JY. KC is avoid all this - engagement in loving service. How Arjuna's reasons were from first 2 tendencies.
                    Ch1 - Applications
                            QA - wars in syria vs MB - purpose of war to establish dharma; codes of conduct (in front not behind); not expanding territory but establish principles of god consciousness.
                            read section and bring out applications - principles above pleasures are duryodhana vs arjuna. Some politics at that time - great materialistic dream - happiness is found in material things - money, sex, tv, video games, 4G will make me happy. It is regularly punctured - psychologically, socially, envt - more depressions, corruption, violence over trivials; tsunami, etc.
                            Duryodhana is prototype of gross materialist - that's what makes me powerful - ppl should die for me. My strategic planning overcoming - forgot God factor like our society forget this.
                            we lose self mastery, moral compass and respect of envt.
                                    !self mastery -> psychological sufferings.
                                    !moral compass -> social sufferings.
                                    !envt respect -> ecological disasters.
                            after correcting these things then puncture will get over - is gita now relevant.
                            it cud be dev life, social life - what we learn or apply.
                            1st topic - war at designated warfare. Predetermined war - not innocents but front end. e1 faces - can't visit their camps.
                                    Duryodhana problem - PITY (with millenials) - Parenting (bad), Impatience (want it now), Technology (overdose), Envt (cozy envt ki ho jaata hai).
                            2nd topic - signs of victory - on side of Krishna then victory. Hanuman so devs who help us indirectly just practice KC with faith.
                            3rd - Krishna can be servant. E1 should aspire for. Seeing but misleading; shabda is important.
                                    Krishna takes us to our weaknesses - our dronas and bhismas; relatives vs principles;
                                    we get fearful of situations cuz of misconceptions - that's what krishna exposes - snake taken as rope and vv.
                                    fear of death but soul never dies. discovery -> contemplate -> internalize the wisdom. From problematic to hopeful one.
                                    Krishna uses experiential learning. Battlefield into classroom - Krishna is that genius - it's most intense - not worried but cool words of wisdom - his consciousness overcome by emotion than reason.
                                    battle of emotion vs reason; pleasure vs principle; duty vs likes.
                                    Krishna doesn't fight for Arjuna - right input to do it well. Like parents don't take child's test.
                            4th - we in material consciousness have enjoyment in same consciousness and reasons fabricated based on that consciousness.
                                    in name of modernity only watering down family traditions.
                                    we postpone - CSDEI - philanthropy or social work so postpone, material sense gratification (my kachori at midnight), sin of ignoring demigods or giving up traditions of birthday bumps or family tradition of drinks on anniversary; Indecision - what if this is non-sense, 7 cooked, whether it will work or if Krishna exists.
                                    Krishna's guidance is yes compassion begin from spiritual and supply others as part of that; eternally blissful; sinful - freed from sin; destruction - dutiful detached devotional in those aspects also; surrender to guru so no indecisiveness.
                            courage to question our questions - irrelevant or destructive enquiry - 5 concepts - PnC in real life - how this conceptual framework is used in different places.
                            bewilderment to clarity; confusion or disparity to decisiveness; depression or weak-heartedness to resolute determination.
                            Gita is not commandments - it is choices and consequences then next you decide.
                    Ch2
                            Be alert active internally responsive.
                            Guru - surrender
                                    perplexities - choose between good and good - weighing them.
                                    Guru gives inspiration, facility, knowledge and engagement.
                                    know right but can't do right - hriday daurbalyam
                                    nth will help me - not decision fight or not - but knowledge to make right choice everytime.
                                    why smile - foolishness, perplexity not too high so avoiding surrender (unt pahaad ke neeche), Krishna amazed at bewilderment by maya.
                                    accepting sm means following instructions.
                            Identity - sankhya yoga - analytical study of matter and spirit
                                    change perspectives. atma tattva - to overcome negativity
                                    mayavad - Krishna never comes under maya. separate individuals.
                                    soul understanding so must tolerate. written on ring - this too shall pass to get peaced.
                                    Krishna uses language of yogic practitioners so upanishadic language - although he is source but relatable as per sections.
                                    solid foundation for spirituality. Tolerance and persevere in spite of material. tattva-vibhrama safety. what to emphasize.
                                    self motivatedness is primary consideration of e1 - reason gives 1 3rd umpire view.
                                    soul is amazing - still bewildered, which category are you?
                            2 dharma - in light of atma tattva. I am soul in body => 2 dharma
                                    svakarma - KK - called VA - stepping stone for spiritual understanding.
                                            I am not body but spiritual soul - but soul encaged in body so complete understanding.
                                            Tone is KK - do duty and enjoy the fruit.
                                            mango tree gives shade, seeds, fruits - so just doing dharma has so many advantages.
                                    nitya dharma - NKY - svadharma in or dovetailed in KC.
                                            do duty whether you get to enjoy or not - cuz the way to spiritual elevation.
                                            transcend 3 MMN - overtly Krishna says KY but BY covertly. Jnan is MOG and Karma is MOP so transcend is just bhakti.
                                            Sacrifice 1 at expense of other - nitya one is better although immature - cuz no loss or diminution.
                                    Yoga - connection is all action engaged for transcendence.
                                            KY - offer fruits. Yajuhosi Yadashnasi.
                                                    yajjuhosi yadashnasi - do what you like but offer.
                                            Buddhi Yoga - actions dovetailed in KC - don't want fruits of work, engage intel. Guru's order predominant.
                                            BY - no independent will. Thy will is my will.
                                            all yellow, white, saffron brahmacari are all residents but yellow are considering, white are monitored and saffron are dedicated.
                            atmarama / sthitaprajna/ samadhi
                            misc - perplexities are hammers to help us grow - reshape our consciousness and lessons.
                                    let e1 read shloka and e1 makes notes - scribe jots eth and gist.
                            anushasan - to be ruled over - difficult to chant on ekadashi with fasting - guru rules sit here and chant.
                            Resolute - Preach and Print - ISKCON and BBT - came from resolution of SP.
                                    how? yasya prasadad bhagavat prasado.
                                    Bhog - sense object, aishwarya - control others; US dream - rich and famous.
                                    vedas for modern times - think TV. Flowery words of vedas - think TV.
                                            every advertisement is for that flowery language - buying into them is fool. Slogan-baazi.
                                            vedas are 99% KK - vancha kalpataru - so it gives you that - but work hard party harder - heavenly situation - material realm we are more narrow but same thing.
                                            enjoy at any cost. Quote vedas that suite your philosophy; work hard to accumulate piety.
                                    multi-branched - this is what happens to you. Progress of KK is like running on treadmeal going nowhere.
                                            such people can't be resolute.
                                    Maya - avarnatmika - covering; prakshepatmika - 3 fold miseries - prakshepa means thrashing.
                                            Eg - alcohol - forgets health; and accidents is prakshepatmika.
                                            avarnatmika - is not even knowing that it is suffering - staying near sewage. Pigs eating eth - so covered - so are we at our place - we are happy. are we? This is avarnatmika. Thinking body as enjoyable.
                                    KK - concluding section talks about jnana and upasana - but most people are lost in jungle.
                                    Vyavasatmika? - how? 4 things
                                            Nirdvandva
                                                    Nirdvandva - not I like, not like but what Krishna likes - not personal.
                                                            overcoming dualities this is the way.
                                                            subordinate your likes and dislikes to the purpose of your life.
                                            Nityasvastha - create association
                                            nir-yogakshema - fearless. Krishna's protection
                                            atmavan - self situated - no1 could lure SP into SG.
                            Arjuna's question on samadhi - originates from Krishna's words - answered in 2 (Nishkam Karma Yoga), 6 (ashtanga), 12 (Bhakti), 4 (samadhi in sacrifice)
                            Well vs many wells - Vedic people yes but specialized practices - specific about what we follow - well serves all purposes of reservoir.
                                    Dhruva got transcendence and also worldly things.
                                    well - bath for men, for women, for drinking, for bath, for buffallos - huge lake serves all purposes.
                                    1 source giving eth you want - like devs - we don't read eth in vedas - don't have to venture into every nook and corner - those individual sections are very alluring.
                                    LCM - conclusion that e1 in kali is fool and not qualified for vedanta so accept conclusion of holy name - SM seeing me fool asked me to chant.
                            Q - Quran and Bible - glimpses of shuddha bhakti but detailing how to do is not there - love god with all your heart and chant the names. rasas and knowledge about lord - detailing is mising so shant and dasya to degree of following - software trial vs full version - sanatan dharma is full version - others are glimpse into it but there is much more available.
                            Sth 
                                    Vaidhi - Kleshagni - freedom from maya surprises.
                                    raganuga - shubhada - saintly qualities.
                                    Bhav bhakti - moksha...
                            Karmanyeva adhikaraste - right over VA but fruits to Krishna - cheating? - carpenter can't claim ownership over sofa.
                                    raw material, talent - eth comes from Krishna - take quota of satisfaction - self preservation.
                                    Vedic no copyright - eth comes from Krishna - Doctor won't charge - no credit give donation.
                                    capitalist countries will faint on hearing this.
                                    Paints, text - no name anywhere - use it - not mine it's krishna's.
                                    no tampering or no exit - fool proof - nth you can do to escape NKY.
                            Setting goal is fruitive mentality - serving Krishna is the goal not personal self. Endeavor is full and not dependent on succeeding or failing.
                            Prescribed works - Routine work (nitya karma), emergency work (naimittik karma), kamya karma (like to do)
                                    16 rounds; janmashtami festivals; like to make garlands.
                                    Prescribed dharma for us is more - bhagavat, pancharatrika, vaidhik (va)
                            NKY how - samatva (equanimity), yogath (situated in yoga), anu smriti (fond remembrance of Krishna) and service.
                                    kripana - we have abundance of spirituality facility but we cover and do other things.
                                    Think a billionaire's child begging favors from shopkeeper - that's kripana. Kripana is shrunk heart, brahmana is broad heart.
                            art to make mercury act as medicine - work leading to liberation is kaushal - yoga karmasu kaushalam.
                                    art requires 3 things - intel, introspection, quality action.
                            NKY thru route of jnana - brahman vs bhakti - vaikuntha.
                            Symptoms - like patient symptoms, doctor, lawyer so does KC person.
                                    ka bhasha - general qualities - 55.
                                    kim prabhashet - dualities reactions - 56, 57 - external and internal provocations.
                                    kim aseeth - how withdraw senses (58-63)
                                    walks - 63 to 71.
                            speech - our contemplations naturally come out. It also created a reality around us.
                                    Eg - Valmiki Muni told by Narad Muni - Apne vichar vyaktavyon se tumne samsar ki rachna ki thi - but you can change that using same mechanism.
                                    Thought words and action.
                                    SG -- we think immense (3 sec pleasure of ice-cream), irresistable not variety - quantum of pleasure is same.
                                    heart's desire and mind's desires are different - heart's true desires are exercised in material world cuz bahirmukha so mental desires but these desires can be fully met in Krishna.
                                    mental diarrhoea - sanskars produced vritti and can't process them. Solution is anshan, healthy tasty bhaat in curd.
                                            sanctioned by guru sadhu shastra can be seen as spiritual desires.
                                            concoction is shaking after adding 2 items together to make chemical reaction.
                                    Be yourself why show happy when you are unhappy and vv - flight view - in KC, all material things seem insignificant.
                                            happy situation is debit from punya bank account and vv - this will regularize your happy distress.
                                            REL Pandavas in distress but thinking about Krishna they were happy always.
                            Sthitadhi muni - speculates as per scriptures. Muni - only on mind.
                                    sukh dukh for prarabdha but devs - orchestration or arrangement for purification for BTG.
                                    upheaval - is part of world so act accordingly after accepting it do sth transcendental.
                                    white noise of 7 praising, 7 despising, etc so he goes on with his business.
                                    Haridas Thakur - Hindu muslims both rejected him but carried on with his business - even provocations from ppl.
                                    indriyas going in all directions like 10 serpents let loose - they will go in all directions so mantra to control them - not to make them listen.
                                    dheera means go to mall for specific items buy it and come back. just fun eg.
                                    Transcendentally situated meaning - naam ruchi, Vaishnava seva, jiva daya.
                                    taste remains though staying away so Bhakti yoga of higher taste is better - dead material things should be seen as dead.
                                    Result - taste (relish), strength (especially provoking situ), pacified (want nth else)

                            fight
                                    + -> defeat then heaven, win then earthly kingdom; cuz kshatriya religious principles.
                                    - -> sin. irreligion in future. killing.
                                            counter - it's not sin if not for self but religious principles.
                                                    counter - why this fruitive proposal if sthitaprajna is higher which I get in "not fight" option.
                                                            counter - MMN force one to act so better prescribed duties for perfection rather than work with fruitive desires.
                                            counter killing - soul never dies.
                            not fight
                                    + -> 
                                    - -> infamy, no heaven for ignoring duties.
                                            counter - better be begger than do sth nasty.

                    motivate
                            evaluate their strengh and how we are better
                            tumultuous conchshells and drums - fun activity of kshatriya
                    take my chariot
                            friend making now? chariot stopped at right place - bhisma and drona
                            compassion and bodily symptoms - guilt over what will be the result
                    Why not
                            Killing own kinsmen - gratitude - better killed unarmed (not preyas)
                                    what good is victory without them
                                    their heart overtaken by greed can kill me ; but I should not kill them (my dharma)
                            sins of killing them (artha shastra but not dharma shastra - not true, not shreyas)
                                    but they are aggressers
                            social impact
                                    No guide => family traditions lost => irreligion will spread => corruption of women and => unwanted progeny

            Title : Preface and Intro - Bhakti Rasa and Uttama Bhakti
                English rendition of Bhakti Rasamrita Sandhu - Nectarian Ocean of Rasa of bhakti.
                @Rasa - aam rasa or ganna rasa but it's emotion basically.
                We cover 19 chapters. Vaidhi and Raganuga Bhakti. Sadhana, Bhava Bhakti and Prema Bhakti - these 3 discussion.
                Forward - Familiar to audience and introduces speaker to others.
                Allen Ginsberg - Forward removed cuz of his taking drugs. So controversial but Harrison kept for Krishna book.
                Prologues - for novels, scene for setting or from middle.
                Preface - Talks about how he wrote BG and his connection with book. Importance for KC movement.
                    here in contrast, he gives what he wants to give Rupa G, introduces bhakti.
                Introduction - Intro of the book itself. Different from Krishna book.
                NOD as summary study. Explanation in english - of intricate concepts that Rupa G wanted to give.
                    summary study means I do what I want. presents in a way that's relevant to audience. Like Krishna book - pastimes buffered with explanations.
                    Doesn't follow scholarly format of BG, Isho, etc - huge amount of effort it is.
                    number of books quoted is phenomenal and many references and many from recall.
                    NOD is technical book so summary study is presented and important for Gaudiya sampradaya.
                    Conjugal rasa is a fact but intimacy is special - sweetness presented thru NOD.
                    Importance of NOD in vaishnavism and vedic culture pyramid is already discussed.
                Why Gaudiya - LCM born in Gauda desh, Jaggery in Bengal - revealed of conjugal rasa in bhakti is done by LCM.
                    Instructions - 
                        Excavate places of Krishna pastimes 
                        and temples. 
                        Write books on PDS establishment.
                            nana shastra vicaranaika nipunau - presented essence of shastras in apt ways.
                        exemplify and teach it to others.
                    externally lost their caste but internally fixed in devotion.
                        protected vaishnava culture and promoted it.
                    Book - Madhurya rasa analysis - ujjwal neelmani.
                Persons may take advantage of this book for advanced devotional service.
                    Enjoy - bhoga and tyaga. @Gulabjamun. Satisfaction then satiation.
                        law of diminishing returns. St bhoga and then tyaga.
                    vs bhakti rasa - whatever accumulated never goes away.
                        emotions we want thru our actions. It will give pleasure and it will last.
                        we focus on engagement and thru this, original soul's emotions get awakened.
                        bhakti and bhakti yoga ain't same - goal and the purpose.
                Propensity to love - we repose the propensity; should ideally be directed to Krishna.   
                    child just thinks of himself and then to others - to family - to society - to nation, etc.
                    expanding circle of love - all humans I will love.
                    problem is it's limited - love family and not others. 
                        Love humanity but not other part of creation like animals - they are slaughtered.
                    @stomach, @root.
                @sun rises and my hand is visible - self realization is automatic result of PDS.

                                    Let lord be glorified - filled with rasa and fills e1 with joy, etc.
                                        Krishna not giver of benediction like BG - this is Krishna of Vrindavan so madhurya rasa.
                                        Relishing madhurya rasa with gopis. I am writing about bhakti rasa and you are reservoir of rasa 
                                        Gopis are attracted to this rasa.

                                        disregard the insignificant rivers of liberation
                                        free from fear caused by net of time - @net of time - another metaphor.

                                            river contains very less water - so liberation is less.

                                Other aspirations become 0 unlike all like mayavadi says.
                                abhilashita - st call to Lord for protection. Please Krishna and not focus on protection.
                                only love and serve Krishna is the goal.
                                Karma and jnana - purity in soul. Covered over by subtle body - material enjoyment and liberation - that's uncovered.
                                    these 2 done for KC - for sake of Krishna - misdirection is given up. Covering is removed not made 0.
                                anukulyena - favorably disposed to Krishna. Enemies of Krishna also gave pleasure to Krishna but their intention not there.
                                anusheelanam - cultivation it is - not just emotion or sentiment 
                                    systematic activities to cultivate bhakti and also emotions.

                    moving from analytical to aesthetical side.
                    philosophical to rasik books. rasik is KK to us but technically - drama invoke emotions.
                Detailed
                    factors that contribute to experience of rasa - natya shastra - only theater.
                    bhakti rasa - constantly experienced throughout life. Not only in theater or so.
                    primary rasa are mode of relation with Krishna - no1 in 7 secondary rasas permanently in spiritual world.
                    eg - Madhumangal - hasya rasa is more but primary is sakhya and hasya is embellishment.
                    primary and secondary characteristics - svarupa and tatastha lakshana
                        bhakti defn - KAI - Krishna activity (shilanam) with Intention (anuulyena)
                            vs devotion for nation, family - love 1 nation then not others but Krishna doesn't limit but pervades.
                            anukulyen - intent to please Krishna - not asuras although they give pleasure.
                            soldier told to go to battlefield - weapons are implied - with Bhakti, Krishna pleasing is implied. So pleasing Krishna and intent are different.
                            Krishna includes his paraphernalia. But difference is understood like feeding soldiers.
                        tatastha lakshana - 1st line of defn - anya abhilashita shunyam and no karma and jnana domination 
                            @purity of water - no adulteration. not dominated by karma and jnana.
                            philosophical speculation is good but reality beyond Krishna - takes us away from Krishna.
                            sukarma is good, not pratikula but too caught up is bad. dushkarma is avoided.
                            astrology with care - different agents of Lord controlled.
                            Eg - SP won't travel on Thursday but will do it if must.
                    give up all updadhi - I am engg, woman, man, brahmin, etc.
                        naham vipro, etc.
                        serve lord of senses by senses.
                    6 characteristics of PDS
                        Sadhana Bhakti
                            Kleshaghni - relief from material distress.
                                permanent relief not time being. anarthas go away and nishtha stage.
                                we experience these effects eventually not immediately cuz we are on path.
                                AC takes heat away - our karma is source.
                                Avidya (ignorance) -> Bijam (Desire) -> Papam (sinful act) -> Suffering.
                                    @fire touching - let me touch that glittering but aah.
                                    avidya kaam karma klesha - some bad karma and desires backlog
                                    @alcoholic has to become free from suffering.
                                        hangover, headache, internally has started spoiling liver but will come eventually - consequences now and later.
                                        @karmic bank account - @water comes and goes away - karma and reactions and buffer (unmanifest).
                                        violent place born, etc. is bad karmic - sanchit karma - kriyaman is what I am doing. Enduring is exhausting bank account.
                                    avidya is foundation - so purified. desires - kaam at different levels and bhakti purifies. 
                                        burnt by fire of devotion - redirect desires from material to spiritual. All anarthas can be directed to Krishna says Narottam DT.
                                        Devahuti - qualified for sacrifices. contaminated and sinful so dont do but bhakti makes them qualified.
                                    unmanifest another reaction is kutam (inclination) for reinforced desires (bijam).
                                    all terminology comes from vedas shloka.
                                    I want to experience smoking and drinking is proclivity - trendy and modern is to mean being sinful.
                                    tendency becomes a specific desire in that association so kutam became bijam.
                                    ajamila - reformed himself from sinful life and 12 years to liberation.
                                    temptations and we already have inclinations which go away with time in bhakti.
                                    child is innocent in one level but proclivity for sinful propensity is there once the opportunity or body is suitable.
                                        I am humble but when in power, it's different - sinful proclivity becomes exposed. bhakti removes the propensity.
                                    bhakti burns suffering in different ways.
                                        avidya gone, desires purified of bijam and kutam.
                                        no emptying the mind of wrong desires but filling with desires of Krishna.
                                        sinful activities gone and reactions.
                                    But reactions suffered by devotees?
                                        Bahu is chastised thru beti. to not alienate her.
                                        Krishna lets devotees suffer for others to learn 
                                        suffering for purification vs suffering for glorification.
                                        determined in DS like SP - obstacles vs eth worked out.
                                        not just law of karma but Krishna's arrangement - karmic reactions s.t it is anukula to bhakti.
                                        suffering removed then devotee may think world is happy; you be happy there; I will be happy here.
                                        Krishan does what's anukula - grow in one's devotion.
                                        LCM says let me take birth outta karma again - let me be absorbed in Krishna.
                                            remembrance relives of next birth. even in this world transcend suffering and misery.
                                    Title: remaining characteristics of DS.
                                    avidya is uprooted, kutam counteracted. bijam nullified. suffering eradicated or transcended.
                                        dadami buddhni yogamtam for avidya. nullified - desires become undesirable - not so much happiness.
                                        suffering won't afflict - like in ac room then no more suffering.
                            Subhada - all auspciousness (sadhana bhakti). Must
                                remove disease + recovery of health. Future positive happiness is guaranteed.
                                Benefit e1 - we improve world 1 thought at a time. Idea changes life and ppl change thru thoughts and desires.
                                    Love non-sectarian for Krishna. Devs fight with opposition - like pandavas with kauravas but still wellwishers. Ram rites for ravan.
                                attract e1 - e1 is ultimately soul and natural relp with Krishna and eventually uncovered.
                                    rise to spiritual reality.
                                produce good qualities - few months devs from selfish actvities to selfless but devp eventually.
                                    soul is covered by lower modes - act positively eventually.
                                bestow superior happiness - neTh without happiness can't survive.
                                    happiness of 3 sources - material, brahman and KC.
                                    KC best cuz eternal and excels and includes others - duration and quantity.
                                    @1000Rs contains 10Rs in it.
                                    Devotee may get material enjoyment also but pleasure which includes that satisfaction also although may or may not explicitly get it.
                                    Impersonalists fall and do social service. Uttama - e1 dev and madhyama - discriminations.
                                        difference - material welfare is material platform - not bad but not spiritual. not real spiritual happiness experienced cuz so much greater.
                                        yoga siddhis - lots of pleasures. apples from kasmir - praptih - principles - universe has higher dimensions.
                                            @ant to travel from wall to floor with 2-D then 2 planes involved but if 3rd dimension then a line can be used.
                                            mind is here then to there - mind is thing so can travel.
                                            experiments - telepathy - other person comes to know - nay-sayers but possibilities are there.
                                            gain control over matter even thru technology also we try to do that.
                                            eg - anima so we have drill machines. Mechanism of techs may be different - miraculous or mythological.
                                            Phone talk to another in US - miraculous but needs to be demystified.
                                            not too excited about tech nor yogic siddhis both are material planes.
                                            pushpak didn't leave a trail of smoke - subtle energies.
                                            tech manipulates matter vs yoga siddhi without gadgetry - at subtle level, can control.
                                            siddhis are childish - I can do what others can't do - ashes from nw some say hoax but can't free from cycle of BODD.
                                            tapasya then siddhis for lifetime then exhaustive. Patanjali says distractions - yoga bhrashta.
                                            even in yoga samadhi is perfection - who is ishwara and what in samadhi not stated by patanjali but in other yogic scriptures especially BG.
                                        prahlad so happy that dont' need anything else.
                                        Kolaveca sridhar - ask me anything - argue and haggle over prices - happiness of spirituality surpasses material experiences.
                                Eg - LCM attracted even animals. Jada bharat won't step on ants.
                                Scientists may not have have high personal standards like regs - intellectual processing and singing etc from past karma.
                                    tendencies may come from past karma but also current choices.
                        Bhava Bhakti
                            Moksha laghutakrit (bhava bhakti) - liberation to insignificance.
                                dev doesn't want DAKM but gets all of them.
                                LCM - 4th SA. Implied happiness that don't want anything.
                                are we really selfless cuz we want to be happy - PDS not for happiness but love of Krishna.
                                    love impels bhakti - happiness is result of pure love not motive of pure love - what comes first.
                                    bhakti results in happiness and not done for.
                                    not deciding which service will make me happy 
                                    Eg - like chandan by madhavendra puri - trouble from physical point of view.
                            Sudurlabha - rarely obtained.
                                unattainable by 1's own efforts
                                    not just our emotion but gift of Krishna - hladini shakti is bhakti.
                                    bhakti is radharani - when we serve and please Krishna then it is bestowed.
                                    extraordinary activities - but sustained and transformational attraction thru devs - bathe in dust of devs.
                                Krishna is reluctant to give it.
                                    Krishna can give liberation but not bhakti easily - gives control
                                    Krishna comes under their control - purer the love.
                                    not withholding but Krishna wants us to want it.
                                    to see sun, I have to open my eyes - wants us to open our eyes and desire to see him.
                                    doesn't give it cheaply. value it and more than other things. 
                                    @Other toys happy then mother can work in other things but nth else settled with then herself.
                                    Lord practically became dasa for pandavas. Only with intimate devs.
                        Prema Bhakti
                            Sandrananda-visesatma (prema bhakti) - concentrated and puts in transcendental pleasure.
                                @nothing penetrates metal - atoms concentrated so is bhakti.
                                happiness is far greater than previous happiness like shubhada and mokshada.
                                @atoms coming closer - more solid.
                                Sadhana bhakti - pleasure of KC > SG but SG still appealing but jaundice so still.
                                    other bhakti stages the pleasures of SG becomes non-existing.
                                Attracts mind - madan - man matta - man matta man matta - madan mohan.
                                    Krishna's raise of eye brow made bow fell from cupid's hand.
                                    but his flute falls seeing Radharani.
                            Sri Krishnakarshini - only means to attract Krishna.
                                sages leave home to see god but here god comes to meet devs in home.
                                Yudhishthir sees Krishna meditating - trance - That bhishma thinking about me and I am thinking about him.

            <SadhanaBhakti> DS in Practice
                <VaidhiBhakti>
                    <Ch2_3>
                        Title: Sadhana Bhakti and Adhikara
                        Chapter title : First stages of devotion
                        DS in practice, DS in ecstasy, DS in pure love (sadhana, bhav, prema).
                        2 each qualities as mentioned in previous chapter characteristics.
                        If prescribed duties don't evoke KC, then shram eva hi kevalam.
                        Bhakti not evoked by anything material - madhurya kadambini not commentary but explanation of NOD.
                            Devotion comes from some devotee - attraction from execution and vv - the circle triggers from mercy of devs and the chain starts from Krishna.
                            Krishna internally helps and externally thru SM.
                            Basis of Krishna bestowing mercy - not punya, paap both are material positive and negative but not spiritual.
                            paap finished and other punya then bhajate maam dridhavrata - here not beginning but determined practice nishtha.
                            arto artharthi etc surrender to Krishan but begin worship not surrender.
                            independent of other factors - Krishna is not partial or arbitrary - VCT concludes - Krishna follows devotee's wish.
                            so bhakti sanjayate bhakti. Attraction to devotee attracts to Krishna.
                            Krishna as cultural or religious figure but not spiritual seekers - only association of devs makes difference.
                        Sadhana bhakti defn - 
                            potentiality becomes manifest - nitya bhav for Krishna becomes manifest not acquire - like SP on HN talk.
                                @baby steps - not capacity to walk. can't fly. potential can't be made kinetic only walk possible so bhakti is brought out cuz potential.
                                not brainwashing - can't last and such transformation - externally dogma is put in head vs dirt in head is washed SP says.
                            performed with senses - not chant in mind.
                                how can mechanical practice lead to devotion?
                                BVT - from imperfection perfection arises - it's not just mechanical.
                                Soul's consciousness is not on spiritual level so spiritual sense objects trigger them.
                                deity is sense object but spiritual sense object - doesn't take consciuosness to material realm - it's Krishna but current stage can't see.
                                spiritual redirection thru senses. name to chant and place to visit - these spiritual contacts soul's engagement keeps removing material layer of contamination and revival happens.
                                development is not best word - revival is better word for bhakti.
                                mechanical without any longing for Krishna - revival without will for it 
                                singers KC songs is money centered not devotion centered - vigorously and sweetly also but won't revive - not longing for krishna although associating with spiritual sense object.
                                association with longing for it. Some attraction we have but not intense so that little bit makes it exponential eventually.
                            bhav is to be awakened thru this.
                                @sun rises. Shravana citta hride kariye uday.
                        Spiritual - madness - amnesia - in movies, I can't recall my name - Forgetting is 1 thing and forgetting that we have forgotten.
                            avarnatmika and prakshepatmika - @cinema - first lights off and then another false identity is thrown.
                            mad person doesn't know that he is mad. Double installment of disease. 
                            So stimulus of past life helps in such case.
                        Sadhana bhakti 2 types - vaidhi and raganuga.
                            vaidhi - impetus for bhakti is vidhi - spiritual regulation - scriptures, SM, etc.
                                not to be minimised - Some level of devotion else why would 7 surrender.
                                this is not spontaneous - st feels st not.
                                fearlessness from death as purpose is vaidhi.
                            Raganuga - spontaneous attraction - if we don't read SP books, we may think our DS as PDS only.
                                This is also sadhana bhakti only. outta attraction for Krishna.
                        Prescribed duties like parts of Krishna's body - fall if don't fix mind on Krishna.
                            principle like compass and rule is like road - road is best way to go in direction but doesn't take but move along - Krishna guides us.
                            we follow rules not for sake of it but reach goal.
                        Chapter 3: Eligibility of the candidate for accepting DS.
                            Devotees types and faith knowledge
                                Kanishtha - Faith weak and knowledge weak - can't offer args for opposing opinion.
                                    not trivialized - faith in Krishna isn't small thing.
                                    Kanishtha not very low level - aspirant for PD - not full faith though.
                                Madhyama - Strong convinced faith and good knowledge but can't defeat.
                                Uttama - Faith strong, convinced and can convince others.
                                    Knowledge strong and can defeat opposing args.
                                More - faith means - just serve Krishna - all other purposes will be served.
                                    Pre kanishtha also - arto, artharthi etc.
                                        Dhruva - artharthi; Gajendra arto, 4 rishis - jnani; naimisharanya sages curious.
                                        without pious, distressed makes a person agnostic or atheistic.
                                        distressed doesn't go to god by default - may aggravate disbelief
                                            Krishna not cause of suffering - help me face and counter sufferings from karma.
                                            atheist - doesn't believe in god but anti-theist - mission to denigrate god and theists - very fanatical.
                                            sukriti - ajnata also - DS in unknown way. favorable for DS.
                                        Sukriti makes 1 pre-disposed to bhakti so arto gives DS incentive.
                                Happiness - Material spiritual (brahman) and devotional.
                                    @bhukti mukti like black art magic.
                                    @ghost haunt us from within - enemy is inside us. these desires cause us harm - not for our self interest.
                                    exorcism of ghost - hare Krishna then it goes away - paradoxical that can't bhakti cuz haunted and bhakti will take it away.
                                        it begins by vaidhi - follow instructions of devotee.

                    <Ch4_5>
                        Title: Bhakti surpasses liberation and is indpendent of everything material
                        previous class eligibility of DS - now move on.
                        attraction to Krishna isn't sentimental - how much pastimes and mood of vrindavan - may disciples lived there but didn't fulfill the mission.
                            Speaking KK should be pleasing to Krishna - if conjugal pastimes, material desires increased in audience isn't that disserve to Krishna.
                            Dev's ecstasy is giving Krishna ecstasy. SP gave KC that's highest DS.
                            what is apt for people should be talked about and seek specifically later on. arrogance to think of oneself as qualified for KK.
                            Gopi bhav club and SP was annoyed - SP wants devs to move to higher level but progressively not suddenly.
                            SP's footsteps can't be followed but instructions following. Advanced topics will come.
                            Advancement can't be judged by how many unique pastimes they know but how much they want to please Krishna.
                        Chapter: DS surpasses all liberation
                            set of quotation this chapter.

                                Prithu - why no liberation cuz no service to Krishna.
                                Kapila - even if given, devs won't accept cuz no service.
                                all other types of liberation is ok but not sayujya - most ppl want to think of only the latter.
                                    devs don't want others also if there's no service.
                                bhakti > mukti is scandalous to many ppl - Haridas T - liberation is easy but Pure love is big deal - brahmin very angry that trivialized.
                                    Gopal chakravarthy - first character assassination - ad homin attack - attack not arg but character of person - seen unethical many times.
                                    mlecchas > brahmins is kali yuga he said. cursed that if you are wrong then nose should fall.
                                    many brahmins didn't like that and closed their ears and bad reaction to gopal.
                                    caste system deep rooted that time. But this is true.
                                chapter devoted to quotes means very important topic.
                                bharat M didn't accept material opulence even liberation.
                                Vritrasur; Lord Siva to sati - apavarga (liberation) also don't want.
                                pancaratra also quoted here; hanuman - liberation - appalling anything except services.
                            liberated from and liberated to - coming outta jail but put to waste land is boring.
                                world is place of misery is focus of brahmavadis; KC also focuses also on liberated to.
                                liberation is insisted (fervent desire) with engagement in DS - liberation already.
                                SP - how many PD in movement - as many disciples - mango is bound to ripe.
                                DS is supreme liberation.
                            Kaivalyam narakayate - highest for some but without service is hell.
                                must reject bhukti mukti for bhakti.
                        Chapter - purity of DS.
                            ahaituku apratihata - another view is no material cause.
                                not caused by material so won't be interrupted by it also.
                                @plane continues if something happens on earth.
                            birth factor in DS - categorically no!
                                middle ages - after LCM - caste goswamis - DS belongs to us alone.
                                    Nityanand Vansham - monopoly on practice and sharing.
                                BVT - reformer; BSS - revolutionary.
                                    gentle changes; shakes up things
                                    paint, reshape the building vs blow up building and do new things
                                    BVT was born in shakta family not goswami family.
                                    he searched a lot - chrisitianity trinity, etc. Accepted Vipin Bihari G as SM.
                                    Brahmins vs vaishnavas by BSS - stampede of appreciation for BSS.
                                    Navadeep attack on him - not practice first, ok practice but can't teach; BSS fought against all this.
                                    @alchemy - makes it gold. But gotta practice DS.
                                KK - prayaschit - continuing Bhakti is atonement for devs.
                                    leadership removed if temporary serious problem - protect themselves and others - I can also do and let himself tap bhakti power.
                                    doesn't remove sinful mentality - when bhakti to lord awakens is solution like sun rises and fog dissipates.
                                bhakti is above varnashram - be in any ashram and varna.
                                    bhakti ages - renaissance - many devs from lower castes and revived throughout India.
                                    #This society balances itself - extreme fanatical brahmins caused probs to PDS propagation in a way and later ppl went against brahmins and again PDS obstruction in a way.
                                    Western disciples - some said in newspaper and asked them to write responses to editor section - yes maybe truck driver (equivalent of sudra) it doesn't matter SP asked disciples to write.
                                Next chapter on how to discharge DS
                                    64 items of DS
                                        20 items of primary importance.
                                            1-10 activities to accept pravritti.
                                            11-20 activities to avoid nivritti.
                                        44 additional items of service.
                                            21-59 - items of sadhana
                                            60-64 - five most effective items

                    </Ch4_5>
                    <Ch6_7>
                        Title : The items of bhakti explained.
                        Till now glories and supremacy of bhakti but from now on, how to practice DS
                        Do this and shloka references for evidence.
                        64 with not equal frequence but as much as possible.
                        Guror padashraya - they are progressing. First 5 all guru related.
                            start siksha
                            seva with reverence.
                            sadhu path following.
                            sad dharma pricca - ask questions.
                        SP doesn't go into sanskrit too much - keeps simple and accessible.
                            SP quotes a shloka with more details in translation quouting - "therefore" word is expanded from shloka.
                            SP knows how to present without confusion.
                            NOD translates not just language but also the contexts.
                        our parampara is shiksha parampara - no fire sacrifices done by goswamis.
                            essence of shiksha is formalized with proper ceremony. LCM of course gave them new names.
                            registered student and then learn.
                            SM guides into DS but has many teachers in university.
                            My guru is best guru is like prof in university - sadhu point is important here.
                                ultimately DS evolution not based on affiliation to guru but graduation from university.
                                guru represents sampradaya and gotta learn from others also.
                                SM not able to continue - difficulties - doesn't mean ISKCON is bogus - no need. I thought my guru is PD.
                                    BVT has talked about it - and taught how to deal with it.
                                    SM connects us to parampara but not only connection - every dev across generation has SP as shiksha guru.
                                    GBC as primary governing body - as sadhus. SP as shiksha or shastra and sm as guru so GSS principle tripod.
                                    Gaudiya may be advanced - serving LCM in mood different from SP.
                            Guru and devs should mutually test each other.
                                following SP and books. Not that I am superior but investing life isn't small thing.
                                SM tests disciple - 1 year 2 year and recommendation from counselor.
                                SM represents Krishna. Start serving Guru.
                            seva - personal service not there - hear and understand mood of SM.
                                like SP disciples have focussed on specific activities.
                                specific instructions possible but general instructions also.
                                not guest but host in KC movement.
                                Local temple authority vs SM - parallel lines of authority - both helping us come closer to Krishna.
                                    they should cooperate. Study previous acarya books also.
                                    sadhus in agreement with SM should be accepted.
                                    we accept buddha but not specific instructions cuz defied scriptures - sadhus in parampara and not defiant to SM.
                                Arjuna asked Krishna also did Duryodhan - 1 asked like newspaper report but deeper question and course of action for life itself.
                        give up eth for Krishna's satisfaction.
                        Hari tadiya accepted like festivals and all.
                            fill with material things then no space for Krishna. Return back to him.
                        Holy places - sacred places where sth happened. Dhams even more potent and PD bhajans there.
                        Live in material so must act in here.
                            avoid atyahar here.
                        fasting - not avoid food but redirect consciousness to spirituality than troubling ourselves.
                            ekadashis - KK perspectives mahatmya. Increase DS is focus.
                        Respect to banyan trees etc - cows, etc.
                        give up non devs
                        not accepting many disciples and make many temples.
                            kings used to make temples - dharmic duty they would think.
                            inspired to do it not just obliged.
                            temples takes effort - fund raising, mgmt, money and material ppl associations.
                            contact with material energy one can withstand. Glorify Krishna is focus.
                            sadhakas or siddhas - that not make disciples - sharing is expected from e1.
                            not frozen but share.
                            Disciple gives big donation doesn't mean qualified for disciples.
                            SP in emergency for preaching - thru letters and sanyasi initiations to very young ppl.
                            This is more evaluated today. Not many scriptures.
                            means and goals - too much then confused - it can stand against opposing doctrines - acaryas have but we may not be able to.
                            can read other books but under guidance like science books if preaching in that way; child care and so on.
                        DS not as license for immoral - Yudhistir told lie but not really.
                            special occasions - material emotions happen but not overwhelmed by it like Arjuna after Abhimanyu.
                            pass thru life stations - train moved forward - some stations are pleasant, some clean, some dirty.
                        don't disrespect devatas and not hurt jivas.
                            krishna like king but ministers should be respected.
                            kevala bhakti is not fanatical - don't have to go outta way to fast and all but can bow down to them.
                            MOP and MOI as per how they are born and upbringing - SP was warm and caring for hippies and transformations.
                            Not moral standards to deride them.
                            Kirtan - slapping ppl others in ecstasy - non-violently in kirtan.
                            Krishna is my lord but also Krishna has connection with e1.
                    </Ch6_7>
                    <Ch8_9>
                        Title: Offenses and Deity worship
                        Aparadh - Radha - sth that takes us away from Radha - DS.
                            don't experience any taste in Sp life - can't go on and go to material life.
                            more dangerous than paap - sinful reactions and MOP and MOI but anti-devotional means no more DS.
                            Divine is seen as mundane. Not feared and paranoid but guidelines - I will do these if disrespectful.
                            Treat Krishna and manifestations respectfully - not shout or quarrel in front of deities.
                            respect to deities - quarrel among children and elders come then no more quarrel.
                                bottomline principle is stay respectful and remember Krishna and never forget Krishna.
                            Eg - SP picture was upside down - this is offensive not personally cares - but attitude of disciples impacts DS.
                                Krishna pic not upside down.
                            Offensives mutually contradictory - SM praised in front and in front of deities then no1.
                                what to do in temples? Krishna is bhav grahi - glorify SM as repr of Krishna but also let me not take focus away from Krishna.
                                mangal arati is SM's praise but all in relp to Krishna - so radharani - DS of SM is Radharani.
                            Not go temple when in grief like death
                                fully available to serve Krishna - distracted by grief then not properly.
                                SP not insistent about it - principle is pancaratra and bhagavat - rules and regs for former but not latter.
                                Srivas T's son then sankirtan. SB instructions.
                                principles for more conscious of Krishna.
                                offenses while deity worship - forgiveness and Krishna forgives. Not portable.
                                Deities taken to park for kirtan. Once installed they are not moved - smaller deities or special like rath yatra.
                                HN is more merciful so portable - doesn't mean we be merciless to deity worship.
                            HN - can clear more sins than most sinful can commit but wrong attitude so let me.
                                once see then liberation and so forth. Expression of Krishna's merciful heart - approach with our heart.
                                our repentent heart attracts that heart but calculated heart attract calculated head that you have so many sins.
                                scriptural promises - are not demands but promises seens as inspirations for intensifying DS.
                                not slip into spiritual world is not goal - won't be happy if not devp love for Krishna cuz that's what it is.
                            LCM - without offenses then lots of progress.
                        Ch9 - further considerations of Devotional principles
                            blasphemy - if bad words, args or give up life. go away.
                                Sati offended so gives up life. Shishupal - many left or plugged ears.
                                Don't label - any criticism not as blasphemy. Clarify but if from heart.
                                Gossips on internet so different backgrounds and different ppl - seniors made progress; prob with individual or distorted truth about him.
                                clarify or counter not in violent ways.
                                Cursing and counter cursing happens there.
                                respond in a way that doesn't make situation worse - devs of Siva - not to create or aggravate conflict.
                                respectful for Krishna and so - clarify and counter; envious then leave the place.
                            tilak and tulsi beads; accepting flower garlands - scented articles - sainted articles - bad pronunciation so misunderstood so edited.
                                SP wanted his books to be edited. 1 mistake kills the book.
                                grammatical checks and pitriloka vs treeloka - laughing stock for those who know.
                                add word to grammar - change the word. sentiment is good.
                                PD is perfect - mistakes - quotes verses wrong - mameti pandava - material vision - wrong conception of perfection - desires to serve Krishna.
                                even with mistakes it is perfect cuz of Krishna centeredness.
                                don't get aught up in such things.
                            arcana has so many parts stated b4 but deity puja specifically talked.
                            Sankirtan - BD as sankirtan also so broad usage.
                                atheitic misconception talks and kirtan asked tamal M - this is kirtan.
                                glories of pastimes; in group chanting glories or names.
                            Japa - individual meditation - others can help us but individual.
                            Submission - personal prayers.
                                languages that we come from - sanskrit and bengali but also personal language.
                                types - sampratmika, dainya bodh, lalasa.
                                    let my mind to you like boy and girl attraction - no education; spontaneity there 
                                        but material level and can lead to perversity if not regulated so dharma of marriage and all.
                                        gopis attraction to Krishna given word kaman - analogy it is.
                                    dainya - no1 sinful like me. ashamed to even speak.
                                        amar jivan - not self pity - inferiority complex is false ego frustrated. humility is false ego rejected.
                                        I want to be famous but don't get it is self pity. Not self centered but Krishna centeredness - gratitude that given me this although not qualified.
                                        I am most fallen - SP - you are most nothing - false ego - my fallen state is greater than Krishna's potential - it's wrong.
                                    lalsa - my svarupa you gimme.
                            Notable prayers - scriptural prayers.
                                Prayer also limb of bhakti.
                                prayers need not be ask but glories.
                                means of devp relp with Krishna - like talk to person devp relp.
                                exchanges leads to love like with jivas. preeti lakshanam.
                                let him live cuz work not finished but add ...if you so desire.
                                memorize prayers help a lot - think of Krishna great help.
                                burden the head in beginning but unburden the heart later.
                            restrict entry to temple - touching deity.
                                enter temple to lower caste - qualified ppl enter.
                                bhakta enter. Original - offensive then offenses that it's stone nth else.
                                given life to Krishna should not be stopped.

                        Title: Hearing Remembering and other items of bhakti
                        Chapter : Techniques of hearing and remembering - these titles are from SP - NOD titles are on direction and waves.
                        Shravanam - 1st by prahlad M. Hear from advanced devs.
                            Kirtan and hearing that is also shravanam. hearing glories, etc.
                            Types - Nam, guna shravan, charitra shravan.
                                @snake bite - consciousness comes thru mantras. Snake of illusion bitten.
                                every illusory sense object is fang of snake so many fangs - enjoying mentality grows and spiritual unconscious we become.
                                we go to doctor but that was different culture - connection of sound on body is researched by scientist - mind pacified thru music.
                                very subtle and not ordinary - can't comprehend but understand essence.
                                similarly thru shravan it cures.
                        Chanting - it's watering the creeper of bhakti - mercy after effort - like chatak expect lord's mercy.
                            Brahmaji - miseries my bad deeds, Krishna has minimised and his remembrance for deeper shelter. Body, speech and heart obeissance. Liberation right 
                                live in bhakti and it's yours just like child inherits eth his billionaire father has.
                            Bird calling out more and more - it gets more.
                            opportunity for DS and devs is mercy - desires but not demands mercy.
                            Krishna I am serious about my relp with you - that urge helps a lot.
                        Remembrance - om apavitra pavitro va. Purifies inside and outside.
                            conscious attempt on object of meditation.
                        Meditation - deeper stage. No conscious attempt anymore.
                        Dhyan - roop dhyan. deities form dhyan from feet to head.
                            raganuga like in material realm - but this doesn't agitate - lust indulgence then frustrating.
                            spiritual hankering is beautiful it gives higher taste from material.
                            Narad M - I regret you won't be able to see me again - 1 darshan for hankering - worldly hankerings will go away.
                            DS is not empty material desire but crowd material desires outta heart thru spiritual desires.
                            lila dhyan, krida dhyan on lord - absorbed in pastimes of lord - dhruva M pastime that LCM wanted to hear.
                            can't do these all day so seva dhyan - deity, cooking, etc.
                            SP genius - seva dhyan - flat bed truck to be used as JBS rath yatra.
                                SP saw building and temple there - SP translated bhakti as DS.
                            Brahmin Pratisthanpur - khir hand burnt.
                                don't do only manas puja. Vasudev gave lots of charity in mind - expressed as action when possible later.
                            Good dhyan considered and bad ignored in kali.
                        Chapter: Aspects of Transcendental service.
                            Servitorship - 
                                karmarpanam
                                    offering fruits of VA (karma)
                                        intended for stepping stone for DS.
                                        not necessarily PDS but karma - ramananda samvad with LCM.
                                        purpose of VA - no satisfaction other than satisfaction of Krishna other than LCM.
                                        Bahya speak more - offering to Krishna cuz have some devotional disposition but eventually it grows.
                                        working for Krishna, offering fruits. Anukula to bhakti and spiritualizes but alone not DS.
                                        work is worship - then donnkey is greatest worshipper.
                                        MP then day becomes act of DS.
                                    offering 9 main DS activities (bhakti)
                                kainkaryam
                                    offering oneself to Krishna.
                                    kinkaroti iti kinkaram - what should I do.
                                    I am servant but how much we feel - if 7 doesn't address us as prabhu - aye, don't know who I am.
                            Sakhyam - intimate, vishvas and confidence that protector, benefactor, well wisher.
                                Eg - draupadi calling out to Krishna - not madhurya her relp but great intensity and faith of protection.
                                Progression of faith along 9 stages of bhakti - love is deeper faith but deepening faith ever.
                                Preaching is becoming Lord's well wisher - no1 more dear to me.
                                maitri - dandavat not to sleep - not outta friendship.
                                    dust of feet on head but gopas - wrestle and tired.
                                    After defeating in malla yuddha - gopas and Krishna fighting and Krishna was defeated - carried gopas shocking kamsa.
                                    carrying on shoulder - scandalous to let touch feet.
                            Atmanivedan
                                atma - refers to self - can be body, mind, soul.
                                vaman dev - universe in 2 steps - 3rd step body offered but also existence.
                                Yamunacaryas - whichever body outta MMN - I surrender to you.
                                generally eth is offered - body, mind and soul but can be separate also.
                                Nija priya upaharanam - offering a favorite article.
                                what's favorite - favorite for Krishna or me? Krishna loves some food items.
                                    sth we value so much - heart to heart connection - link becomes stronger.
                                all endeavors for Krishna - factory results.
                                sharanagati is whole-hearted but previous can be done without attitude also - just obligation.
                                Tulsi shalagram vivah - medicine value but devotion.
                                    can chew also cuz manifestation of Krishna's erergy.
                                    Krishna prasad is manifestation of Krishna - how can I eat without chew.
                                    honoring - different manifestations have different ways to approach.

                        Title: 5 potent forms of DS.
                        Not last 5 items of DS.
                        Chapter: further aspects of Transcendental Service
                        Important - bhav can be evoked thru different activities studied till now.
                        hearing the revealed scriptures
                            SP books are scriptures cuz the message. Shlokas - reccitations.
                                Puranas and itihasas - focus on meaning not every word. Smriti - remembered and explained.
                                smriti - same knowledge has different dressings as per TPC.
                                SP books - scriptures is evolving body of knowledge.
                            toward of end of SB - not other taste needed.
                        Residing in mathura - specific here.
                            many places of pilgirmage but hierarchy.
                            Krishna born and activities - includes vrindavan.
                        multilevel worship - higher than Krishna worship is his tadiya. Dog of billionaire - owner also happy.
                            paradoxical - those my devs are not my devs - truly value.
                            hearing about Krishna from devs is also service.
                        Serving the lord as per position - holy days more accessible then celebrate them.
                            home deities are expansion of temple deities - not replacements.
                            expansion means expansion of our service.
                            Increase DS thru deities at home or center is good but not use one form of service to minimise other form of service.
                        DS in Kartik - Radharani's month.
                            whole month is festival - damodarashtakam.
                            4th month of chaturmasa - time for austerity whole of chaturmasa.
                                but for oneself not others.
                            bhishma vrata on last days - great if you can.
                            PDS result - Chanting result is more chanting.
                                not praise - good if they do. But more for Krishna - taste in service - desires for material and liberation kicked outta heart.
                        Observing festivals wrt activities - janmashtami.
                            Krishna's descent is thrilling momment - expression of love for all jivas.
                        Serving Deity - takes far beyond mukti.
                        Recitation of SB - connect with Bhagavan.
                            LCM and Gadadhar Pandit - long hours and copy and text washed away from books.
                            estasy for PD but we will also slowly but surely start getting a taste.
                        association with advanced devs
                        Chanting HN and mathura - repetition but subtle differences - similarities are also to drive home that so important.
                            like soul in BG 2 - hanyate shire - remove ambiguity and drive home the fact.
                            harer naam -3 kevalam.
                        Most potent forms of DS (the last 5 just covered) - ABCD (Dham and deity)
                            A
                                Sajatiya - jati not caste but more - caste is human types - administrative, intellectual, etc.
                                    caste not by birth but psychological disposition - more of human types.
                                like minded Devs - BD important, no temple is important - SP focussed on different services at different times.
                                Most important service than this - BD, Vrindavan, Gurukul - vaikuntha children, etc.
                                    so can take quotes for your service - battery of pet quotes to support what you want.
                                We are all individuals so attracted for different aspects of DS.
                                    others can have different defn of success - no imposition on each other.
                                    what are you inspired by - don't make other insecure.
                            D - Holy places - textual description, sensory perception, devotional realization => extremely  potent experience.
                                here is govardhan hill etc - seeing also purified - not just.
                                BSS - Enough that lord has seen me - other times he would go close - eyes in DS not grats.
                                read earlier and from devs. They may have sweet experience and tell us about it - more potent experience.
                                remember details and thank Krishna for descending.
                                Even without sensory perceptions some devs like SP can remember Krishna.
                                Radha Damodar room of SP was too small - speak about Krishna, etc - he saw facility for Krishna service.
                                Any mountain and SP would remember govardhan and river - then ganges, etc.
                                if any forest is vrindanvan then LCM didn't have to go to Vrindavan - his ecstasy became high there.
                                It's not a substitute all the time. So recollection helps. Intense unforgettable experiences possible.
                            D - Deity worship - enigmatic prayer.
                                If attracted to material world then don't go see Krishna on keshi ghat - indirect glorification. Please go and see there. Very poetic.
                                Such a sweetness of expression - deity sensory experience of God thru deity and serving it thru different ways.
                                MP - deity centered - kirtan, HN, Association, service, sajatiya there.
                                Temples are vaikuntha - Forest in goodness, cities in MOP and brothels, wine houses in MOI.
                                Where my devs glorify I reside there. Going to temple is like going to holy places - New Vrindavan, etc.
                                These are home deities:temple deities::temple deities or new Vrindavan:Dham Vrindavan.
                                Sending devs to pilgrimage is expensive - SP - will I stop prasadam cuz it's expensive.
                                Once in a while for yatras also. like temple visit from home center.
                            Very potent forms of DS - devotional feelings arise - tap the potency.
                                from abstract feelings - just longing? good but also the process for changing the heart thru devotional stimuli.
                                amnesia will be recovered and consciousness revived.

                        Title: From Vaidhi to Raganuga Bhakti
                        Bhakti doesn't depend on VA.
                        Chapter - Devotional Qualifications
                        Jnana and Vairagya not included - not integral but helpful - not always helpful.
                            Vishvaroop takes sanyas - don't let LCM study then will take sanyas
                            Knowledge leads to vairagya but can also lead to raga - Surf on internet then contaminate mind - can bypass cuz knowledge.
                            Meant to use Intelligence to control enjoying mentality but use intelligence to further our enjoyment.
                            Jnani approach is analytical approach - no active attraction. Need aesthetic appreciation.
                            Krishna wants us to love him - so just analytical enough.
                            No no no to emotions also makes us say no to spiritual emotions also.
                            Our problem is not attachment to maya but detachment from Krishna - we seek alternatives for a reason.
                                Attached to Krishna, Maya - 00, 01, 10, 11 - Materialists, Devs, Sahajiyas, Impersonalists !respectively.
                            Unfavorable Jnana - In intention, constitution and destination - oneness with god, drying of heart so no emotions and liberation to merge. Bhakti is different.
                                Anu vs vibhu. Mayadheesh vs Mayadheen.
                            Jnana can be anukul if emphasizes difference, talks glories and takes us him and pratikula if impersonalists way.
                            Similarly for vairagya - can be favorable or not - @Markat Vairagya - 
                                Monkey renunciation - no clothes - desires become different 
                                unclothed then more agitated so prescribed e1 
                                nature has produced me so. Nature itself changes me in puberty so adapt.
                                false renunciation this but phalgu vairagya is not accept money from anyone - could not sleep with money there.
                                Money seen as lakshmi is ideal not as maya.
                            So use as required - yukta vairagya.
                                you gimme from 1 hand I put another hand ahead but for Krishna's service not oneself.
                                1 suitcase and empty in matter of minutes to all departments.
                                Better never go to internet? - but can be phalgu internet - other religions, impersonalists they will make their presence felt so danger is there.
                                there is a danger - so vairagya has to be there. else for oneself.
                                Sunday feast and devs ate eth b4 guests would. Tech gadgetry if misused - then precautions if misused or filters so that not easy misuse it.
                        Nonviolence - Dev is naturally non-violent so don't have to be.
                            vegetarianism is natural for dev. So don't have to join those movements.
                            4 regs from very beginning. Good qualities from naturally.
                            Mrigari half kill for torture then eat but later won't step on them for obeissance but higher purpose - yes but why step.
                            Good qualities devp from DS and DS don't need good qualities but help.
                            From Bhakti - Jnana and vairagya automatically come.
                            1 limb of bhakti or many limbs of bhakti - procs. Specialists for all of them.
                                should we engage 1 or all - yena kena prakarena manah krishna niveshayet.
                        Bilvamangal T - liberation is maidservant of devotion.
                        Chapter: Spontaneous DS
                        Direct associates of Krishna. Raga atmika - essential purpose is to satisfy Krishna. Raga anuga - follow the path of raga.
                        raga anuga - impetus for service from inspiration not vidhi.
                            ragatmika are residents of sp world and raganuga are followers of them.
                            1 associate most inspiring so bond established with Krishna in center.
                            Eg - Yashoda M and dev in material world may serve like her. Form based on past karma.
                            It is advanced stage and can't do - strange noises from room - human being chirruping like bird and back and forth and making sounds.
                                advanced guru in spiritual world so practising so that well seasoned peacock - SP said nonsense.
                            svarupa siddi can happen after death also.
                            modelled on some advanced devotee - raga means color and imbibe that color is the idea.
                            2 types of raga atmika - sambandha and kaam rupa.
                                Fear - Kamsa saw wives and remembered Krishna balaram is coming - so Krishna conscious no material desires. But absorbed - not favorably of course.
                                Envy - Shishupal.
                                Lust - Gopis.
                                bhakti - devs.
                                reduced to 2 - Kamsa not in spiritual world fearing and also envy.
                                Vrishni sambandha - raga atmika - eternal in spiritual world.
                                Pandavas with Krishna not raga atmika entirely - sometimes awe and reverence.
                                So only sambandha and kaam - both are relationships based.
                                Yadus and vrishnis very exalted but Gaudiya exalt gopis of Vrindavan.
                                Lust vs love - for Krishna's pleasure vs ourselves. How dress and decorate but for Krishna - appear selfish but actually selfless.
                                Gopis not telling we are not ready wait like decoration going on but rush with cosmetics put in wrong places but only Krishna's pleasures.
                                decorate opulently for Krishna but can forget also.
                                Shukadev no material attraction - so why attracted to sth sexual.

                    <Ch16>
                        Title: Raganuga Bhakti
                        practice of perfect devotion vs practice of perfect devotion - in footsteps of.
                        lust:love::copper:gold
                            @may look similar thru coating - heat of challenges then the truth gets exposed.
                        Chapter: Spontaneous devotion further described.
                        9 stages of bhakti - vaidhi bhakti - anartha nivritti done, nishtha then raganuga can start.
                        anartha nivritti
                            Jumping into river and breaking head looking for mango in reflection - see artha where there is no artha is anartha.
                            we stop serving anarthas and anarthas will go away - yes to Krishna and hence no to maya then anarthas go away.
                            @sales person again and again - once and for all no then gone.
                            @pet dog - can bite so push the dog away. Rabid dog - once in a while patting then it can't away - no fondling any more.
                            we have adopted lust so many times - it's enemy - so no but few times of saying no then yes - oh, master still loves me.
                            Raga without this is sahajyaik. Raga should be revered.
                                simply thinking of themselves like that they they think have become that - such danger they fell into.
                        many pastimes - we get attracted hearing them - love in material world - force of love needs no need from logic.
                            moves forward - shadow but original is in Krishna.
                            doesn't need scripture != not following scripture.
                            Ram lila so many attracted so svarupa is in ayodhya - this is cultural nostalgia, not spiritual attraction but cultural.
                            after purification of material conditioning - even shant rasa comes after all stages of bhakti.
                            particular dev's pastimes, relp and interactions with Krishna.
                            construct temples in vrindavan instead of bhajans? - that's how purification happens - artificial remembrance without it.
                        Gaur lila and Krishna lila - some personalities appear there.
                            Associate of lord - meditate on sadhak and siddha rupa - Rupa G is also manjari so can meditate on both.
                            Rupa Manjari conjugal age below - very young and observe when they unite - great ecstasy 
                                greater observing than participating - can see both ecstasy. No rush cuz exalted subjects.
                            Rupa G - sadhana standards very high. can emulate.
                                SP - Mood of sanyasi from 6 goswami ashtakam.
                            imitate gopis - artificial to wear clothes of gopis although men.
                                covering on body won't change the soul.
                                Even gaur lila emulation. Raganuga continues with regs like neophyte not succumbing to anarthas.
                                wearing dress and ornaments isn't regulative principles that's flaw of sahajyaism - #vinashaiva kalpate. 
                                ?It's a lapse from worldly standpoint - it's unfortunate.
                        Focussed bhakti limbs - ?it's like specialization
                            hear about associate.
                            serve externally and internally in mood of that associate.
                            continue regs along.
                            eventually bhav will come.
                        Kamarupa vs Kamanuga is specialized eg.
                            svakiya and parakiya - your own vs 7 else's.
                            wedlock - immoral to have relp without it in material world but trans-moral.
                            giving up good and bad for Krishna's sake - for sake of Krishna giving up even your chastity is a great sacrifice.
                            @elephant's rope - internal realization and external expression - elephant sees a female and tree rope falls.
                            Gopis we have left all relatives is not easy - intensity of their love.
                            wife and husbands all belong to Krishna so nothing immoral there.
                                ?question is why husbands also didn't run to Krishna.
                            Types - sambhoga icchamayi vs tat tat bhava icchatmika.
                                Mood of the heroine vs mood of the heroine's maid.
                                being in the mood or serving that mood.
                        Sambandhanuga - friendship and parenthood.
                            take up the role or assisting them in their service.
                        Is attraction in different body possible?
                            yes, dandakaranya sages they got desires to serve Rama as consort - next life he said.
                            They became some of gopis in Krishna lila.
                        To become parents of Krishna is replacement attitude - not ideal. This is like mayavad - becoming not Krishna but associate.
                        different names b4 - pushti marga and maryada marga - same as raga and vaidhi.
                        are we in raganuga - if we keep practice vidhis primarily by mercy eth will happen trace doesn't matter.
                            we cherish at levels we are at.

            <Ch17_18>
                Title: Bhava Bhakti
                Chapter : Ecstatic Love
                @ray of sun - prema is like sun and bhav is ray of sun.
                softness of heart comes - bhav.
                Shuddha Sattva - trans to MMN not MOG.
                Krishna has internal energies - prominent being samvit knowledge for love and hladini pleasure thru love.
                Pure knowledge is about Krishna - samvit is cognition and hladini is affection potency.
                    @sitar - knowledge and desire to play when pleasure involved - affection.
                    sandhini provides facility - internet to get the course.
                    Krishna mercy not amorphous but personal - all 3 help us serve better and better.
                        material facilities can be used in Krishna's service also.
                    spontaneous attraction to material things - so is attraction to Krishna.
                ray of sun also gives warmth but full fledged sun is deep warmth. Very very exalted state but from prem perspective it's small.
                    SP - It is state of uttam adhikari.
                    LCM - jumped in river - softness of heart.
                sadhana is executive and bhav to effective - execution to move forward and effective meaning that it is an effect.
                Uttama bhakti - 
                    cestarupa - external and internal aspects to it.
                        sadhana endeavors for bhava 
                        sadhya effect of bhava
                    bhavarupa
                characteristics - MOPG, softness of heart.
                not in contact with Krishna but aspiration is very deep - cherished desire.
                outward appearance of ecstatic symptoms they stay wihin mind and continuation of ecstasy called samadhi.
                    @fire - rod become characteristics of fire. external changes and internal changes.
                    internal changes may stay.
                Bhava attained by practice and mercy - practice of vaidhi and raganuga
                    Narad Muni thru vaidhi. Krishna appeared and then disappeared - devastated - you will be able to see me next life.
                    he can fly and always in KC.
                    4 months - echoed in his heart and those words map for his life and his life's goals.
                        bhaktivendta's desires became his own.
                    Chandrakanti - danced for entire night - vaidhi - we dance as part of program.
                        dancing for Krishna's pleasure - devp of bhav bhakti.
                        to not waste any time - avyartha kalatvam.
                receive mercy thru vacika, darsana dana and harda - words, glances and good wishes.
                    Krishna's words of blessings like I bless you to Narada - this is not small thing. Performative utterance - that will happen - omnipotent.
                        @Judge says let he be hanged and it will happen.
                    given a vision - stricken with feelings on seeing Krishna - bhaav after seeing.
                    shukadev G - DS for long time. Lord's assurance that Shukadev won't get trapped.
                    Love of god in mysterious ways - Narad M assurance about Prahlad and Mrigari transformation cuz blessing of Narad M - blessings or heart wishes carry weight.
                Chapter : character of 1 in divine love
                    softness of heart - crying tears - how to know if 7 has love.
                    outer tears with inner ecstatic love - prestige want so bring tears - ran away cuz pretention won't work in front of Haridas Thakur.
                    private tears of love - external without internal possible and internal without external.
                    symptoms which are not immitable can be checked - abhas and chaya aspects also - shadow emotions later.
                    viz - 
                    utilization of time (avyartha kalatvam) - can't live without glorifying Krishna.
                    Perserverance - even in disturbance. Cursed Parikshit - glories of lord for transcendence.
                        find a way ahead. Ganges finds a way in spite of obstacles.
                        books ran outta funds, so many probs in SP life.
                    Virakti - Detachment - Bharat M - desire to attain uttam shloka.
                        jugupsitam - left like after toilet. graphic eg.
                    Pridelessness - Bhagirath. Lal babu. So much honor but left for Krishna.
                        getting tears is easy but this ain't easy over years.
                    Great hope - Devotee - if Krishna says that no hope for your spiritual advancement still dev should continue - one day I will.
                    samutkantha - desire to see. can't sustain eagerness over years.
                    attachment to HN
                    to descibe lord's qualities
                    attraction for places of pastimes - this longing is different from vaidhi principle of should stay there.
                    Pratibimba and chaya - connection with reality but not reality.
                        motivated for karma and jnana success - bhakti intensely as tool - experience ecstasy in dev association chanting and dancing - not real thing - abhaasa.
                        impure motive then not full emotions.
                        not advanced emotions although may seem.
                        ram das vishvas - wanted to become ram - pratibimba namabhas.
                        chaya - not purified but in association, glimpse of that - potency in association.
                            eyes widen and face glows with brightness - not pure ecstasy but shadow.
                        both not real thing.
                        chaya is better cuz not contaminated.
                        come to real substance thru pure desires.

            <PremaBhakti> DS in Love of God
            <Ch19>
                Title: Prem Bhakti
                prema is developed stage of bhav so not detailed.
                Pure love of Godhead.
                completely softened heart. sense of ownership is abondoned. strong feelings of possessiveness for lord
                Narad Pancaratra - lust reposed in Krishna is love. BVT poem says let my lust redirected to you.
                    complete redirection is love of God.
                    Bhisma - repose affections totally on 1 person - but not exclusivistic?
                        focus is on Krishna and spreads from there.
                        tried as much as possible to set duryodhan on right path.
                Intense feeling of love - complete softening of heart.
                2 moods in relp - tadiya (I am yours) and mayiatva (You are mine).
                    feeling not condusive for devotion. I have something.
                    Not stand in love but fall in love. Relp means subordination.
                    You are mine is higher than I am yours - Yashoda M already implied that 
                        You are mine but he is mine so I have to take care of him.
                    possessiveness is thought of as bad - nirmamo and nirahankara - 2 modes of illusions.
                        I am body and I have mine.
                        but evolved understanding of spiritual life - distortion of material world given up.
                    Radharani angry that Krishna likes candravali - not of greatness. God is all powerful ok but mine.
                        intense possessiveness - JBS pulled to Vrindavan - Krishna belongs to us.
                    I am yours is there but subordinated to You are mine.
                    BVT - what other wealth do I need since I am yours and you are mine.
                achieving prema
                    special mercy
                    bhava - vaidhi and raganuga.
                Spiritual emotions and not much sadhana bhakti then from previous lives.
                    all this we discuss is multi-lifetimes process.
                    PhD thru study is standard process but some exceptions and extraordinary writer then honorary PhD from universities.
                    kripa is possible but not standard route.
                    Krishna's mercy gives progress - not only on kripa or effort.
                    don't demand mercy like business - max return on investment.
                    that mood is non-devotional.
                    Krishna can give that darshan and done but that's not good mood to expect - love means to not hold back but give love.
                    Not all gopis - some gopis got perfection thru Krishna's association says Krishna to uddhava.
                        gopis didn't go to pilgrimage places - it was home which happened to be great but association made difference.
                Types of prema
                    mahatmya jnana - mixed with jnana and awareness - veneration
                        prema becomes a little shithir says LCM.
                    kevala - unmixed pure prema.
                        Eg - Yashoda M's love for Krishna - bless Krishna and sandals on head. contaminated don't even enter temple premises.
                        scandalous thought sandals on Krishna's thought - think sandals on deity head is scandalous thought.
                        awareness of God - forgotten. Stars vanish in brightness of sun.
                        Narayan protects Krishna - enters inside with power when demons come.
                    Damodarashtakam - Lake of ocean of happiness - telling that veneration doesn't win him like yashoda M's love has.
                    With such purity and intensity that yoga maya covers them.
                        Dev remembers God and forget his godhood. Mahamaya - 00. come out - 11.
                        Cultural ppl - God without godhood them also - cultural familiarity - what is greatness and position. Richer and deeper then godhead - concealed.
                        vrajavasis have intense love for Krishna but not common religious people.
                        external expression of happiness doesn't work in spiritual realm.
                        Eg - SP said in photo you look very grave - that was moment of ecstasy. Not just external smile but remembrance.
                        Crying for separation from Krishna - I thought love of God I will become happy and devs in prema - topmost are crying.
                        after so much sadhana and regs all I have to get it crying for rest of eternity.
                        superficial understanding - central aspect isn't externals. Remembrance of Krishna is source of happiness.
                        Remembrance of Krishna not like view of sunrise.
                        Passive object vs living loving person. Mood of emotions will change and agony but intense remembrance so ecstasy.
                        SP angry st - not completed work - furious but not material - offering you temple which is not even ready.
                        SP in anxiety - did land come or not in Mumbai - the land is yours. Spiritual emotions.
                        How advanced - it takes one to know one - plastic smile can fake it so characteristics doesn't say smiling or happy looks.
                            plastic smile in corporate secretaries.
                            see dedication. SP helped us understand.
                        BS course - our service to SP. Books as presented from acaryas - receiving mercy.
                            Isho harmonize and not distracted. Bhagavan.
                            NOI - focus on knowledge is transformational how to practice BY. Bhakti.
                            BG - various path - different yogas - lead to bhakti from KY and JY and middle chapters glorify BY. Conclusive demo on eth.

            <WesternWave> Primary Rasas
                ...
                <VatsalyaRasa> Parenthood
                    ecstatic love steadily instablished into this relp.
                    represents superior personality.
                    bodily - softness, delicate, analogies - lotus, colors.
                            impacts - overflowing love - feeding milk.
                    Our worship saved Krishna. 
                    Thinking meek or dependent - Govardhan lifting credit to Nanda M. We need to maintain Krishna. Chants for his protection.
                    Eg - Original parents, surrogate parents, ?maids, Balrams's parents, Other elderly parents, aunts, Guru.
                    Beatiful; great efforts for child - disarrayed hair decoration, churning butter, perspiration. Poetic - bodily frame decorates the ornaments.
                    Seeing the face in tears of affection.
                    enjoying the growth of child - walking tryst - tears in eyes.
                    age, dress (dressing), movements, words (broken), smiling, decoration - provocative observations of the child.
                    different activities - sucking thumbs, lying flat - not restricting but eagerness. ?St restricting
                    thin waist, broad chest, curly hair; take care of calves (responsibilities), configure him (flute, bugle)
                    worrying - late arrival from pasturing. Bird's view from high point.
                    see him wandering in forest taking care of calves.
                    turbulences - breaking milk pots, churning rod, butter into fire.
                    Observe and allow his little tricks - see him steal butter, don't expose yourself. Observe his fearful gestures and sidelooks, glances.
                    direct expressions - smelling head, kiss, embrace, patting body, face, etc, offering blessings, ordering him, gazing at him, good instructions to not become thief (maze). 
                            Stealing not wrong in spiritual realm. Origin of tendencies.
                    chastising then loving.
                    mental embraces. lifting them then embracing.
                    tears with insecurity - Krishna lifting hill from wrong place. couldn't instruct at that time so stunned in choked anxiety.
                    Tears of joy after scare. Cooling soothing touch > sandalwood.
                    anxiety to hear his flute when late. Searching for the boy - like in Kurukshetra. Gazing on the road.
                    poetic - no need for anxiety cuz whitened ganges and blackened yamuna thru milk and tears and already informing Krishna.
                    fire appears cool with looking your face and ocean of nectar seems poison if your darshan is missing.
                    many other symptoms, such as great anxiety, lamentation, frustration, being stunned, humility, restlessness, madness and illusion
                    Separation from son. Falling seeing pots, motionless eyes.
                    lamentation could not get son married after kaishora age.
                    useless milk if fails to satisfy Krishna. Missing all past activities with Krishna.
                    accusation with sharp words to husband - why not go see Krishna, hardhearted, pity.
                    Praying to see him again.
                    madness in separation - asking animals, plants about Krishna, if he passed by.
                    Illusion in separation - why agitated. Look carefully Krishna is here. Stay peaceful and don't act like madmen.
                    fulfillment of desire - wives of Vasudev seeing Krishna in wrestling arena.
                    There is lots of apt mixing of rasas also - servitude, fraternity, parental.
                </VatsalyaRasa>
                <ConjugalRasa>
                    appears heroic - he has no rival. no1's greater than him. conjugal love excel eth.
                    great attention - even when apparently ignoring. Joking phrases to enjoy more. Even her neglect is pleasurable.
                    Vichalit on contact - heaving chest, eyes tears. faltering speech.
                    Frustration - eth useless without him - no use of fragrance of flowers, body, gold, etc.
                    Retrospection - who is this boy who...bodily beauty (eyelids, face, ears, cosmetics, smile) - impact on me (impatient, desire for conjugal, more than tolerance). Analogies - female elephant. cakori, moon, water, lotus, worldly love.
                    Immediate attention - seeing chandravali but lightning turn on seeing Radha.
                    Krishna's affection for Radha didn't wither by soothing and disturbing effects.
                    divisions
                            vipralambha - vigat prakrista lambha (receive to get) - receiving in a special way being denied.
                                    purva raag - preliminary attraction.
                                            Eg - can't do household duties since he saw me near bank.
                                            Eg - Krishna - can't sleep at night - my marriage cancelled cuz of Rukmi.
                                    maan - seeming anger.
                                            Eg - enjoyment with others - jealous cuz prestige dimmed. seeming disagreement telling a friend in flower bush.
                                    pravaas - separation by distance.
                                            Eg - Krishna to mathura - tears shedding with hand on head. Uddhava says - not getting rest and not accepting proper lunch.
                            sambhog - enjoy in togetherness.
                                    Eg - expert embrace ; celebration dancing like peacocks.

                    dialog between Parikshit and Sukadev
                            Q - duty of soul all times and 1 about to die
                            A - constantly remember and hear about Krishna.
                                    not working hard, money making and family care.
                                    work and reward - then forces are destroyed at time of death.
            </Context>
            <Sarg>
            sarg - creation (2st and 3nd canto dedicated to sarg and visarg)
                    facility for jiva to enjoy in world
                    constitutional to pleasure Krishna
                    why comes down - causeless envy, stupidity - try to prototype god.
                    symphony - all egos are tuned in to please Krishna.
                            as per direction of director - guitar plays separately not as per direction then create a separate facility - so give a separate room 
                            grossly few universes - unlimited - software of false ego so internal universe they can be master.
                    why variety in material world - satisfaction of I have better than somone else.
                    Sukadev had audience sitting yogis and jnanis - so stages of yoga - but supersoul meditations difficult cuz of distraction external so meditate on universal form.
                    original ingredients - 24 elements starting.
                    mind has tendency ot think material - when material thought comes connect to Krishna in some way.
                    lower planets like thighs of form.
                    satya is head of universal form. Indra like arms of universal form.
                    Yama - front teeth of universal form.
                    smile of universal form - maya - get enchanted.
                    glance of UF - samrasa
                    ?shyness is upper lip of UF. Greed is lower lip.
                            Factory tensions - give factories to us and you be peaceful - I will come some other time.
                    sin is UF's back - In pub, I was massaging his back.
                    ocean - abdomen. mountain - bone, river - veins, clouds like hair.
                    eth contemplated as part of Lord - all thoughts are spiritualized.
                    hatred envy desires are overcome.
                    gameplan - why talk about sleeping mahavishnu rather than rasa lila (we are sleeping in maya) only purified are qualified to hear about lilavatara.
                            Too much details on how Sense objects created then detachment comes - like coming then don't like to eat sweets so much.
                            Jnani - attracted to brahman and others to paramatma
                            self and meditation talks attract them.
                            limb burnt by fire - fire is used to cure. haunted by ghost then ghost mantra.
                            jiva sleeping in maya to be woken by topics concerning maya - connect to right sense object.
                                    human sees human attractions mosquito to human attractions are different - how's that?
                                    realize my attraction to SO facilitated by Krishna - how merciful let me serve him.
                            SB says in reln with SL - constantly describes, remembers and hears about maya in relp with Krishna then not bewildered by maya.
                            desire for enjoyment counteracted by these details.
                    vidura separation from Krishna so let me hear about his material energy.
                    sarg and visarga are lilas by purushavataras and brahmaji, others - maya shakti but chitt shakti later.
            </Sarg>
            <Visarg>
            visarg - sub-creation
                    Lord gives brahmaji idea how to create.
                    brahma vishnu and shiva
            </Visarg>
            <Sthiti> protection
            Sthiti - right situation (right situation to obey the lord) - 4th and 5th canto
                    soul has desires - start desires activities to take BTG.
                    right position - lord is always protecting his devotees.
                    e1 goes back to godhead when lord gives mercy. Protection that Lord offers.
                    3rd canto Kapila - Bhakti in MOG, MOP, MOI - Daksha angry to Lord Shiva - 1 person didn't get up not that so many stood up.
                            ishta goshti but end with mushta goshti.
                            daksha was devotee but in MOI cuz of separatist kinda.
                    Dhruva M told - you cry tears and I will only add so approach Vishnu.
                            wanted to be greater than brahmaji.
                            immature - then play but mature - then forgive.
                            Dhruva said good lecture. but I am kshatriya - give this lecture to brahmanas - I just want revenge.
                            Determination guided by Narada. Other desires also get purified - and get fulfilled.
                            1 devotee fed up not getting interviews - how you can lead so said Trinad api sunicena.
                                    bewildered - gave full translation - technical bored so EOD some nice katha
                                    narrated points from katha - 45 minutes.
                                    #he got selected 1 person - so some of you can try this technique.
                            but to ensure that Krishna has power to fulfill so separate planet created for dhruva.
                            what lord can give no1 else can.
                    Prithu M - 100 horse sacrifices then insecurity in Indra so stole horse.
                            about to kill indra - bogus sadhus - all apasampradayas - Indra was founder-acharya.
                            brahma tells prithu not indra - purpose is upholding dharma - by adherence adharma is getting created so why not abstrain from it.
                            Vishnu appears with Indra by his side as if he is hero - envious of others not torment others and forgiveness - doctor doesn't slap patient who vomits.
                            Lord has desire and submission to Lord's will is greatest sacrifices - 100th sacrifice of opinion or false ego - pleased Lord like nth else could.
                            Lord made him opulent and famous - submitted to will of not doing sacrifice became more famous than indra - Lord protected him - never lose by taking shelter in Krishna.
                            solid returns - this is right position - I don't worry I won't crush you only the false ego
                    Priyavrata M - tapasya - with Narada - please change your plans and marry.
                            submission to lord's will made him glorious.
                    Prachinibharichat and pracetas
                            karma kanda with animal sacrifices - tells story of puranjan.
                            very interested in story but after some time - suspicious - too familiar a story
                            is it story about me - of course, I was talking about you only - stop doing it.
                            parokshavad - indirect story - doubt is created but he won't offend me like this.
                            Eg - Duryodhan troubling others very bad and while taking prasadam you realize I also gotta give that up.
                    Bharat M and Rishabh Dev
                            attached to deer. fell down - jada bharat - rahugana.
                            Forest of enjoyment in detail.
                    5th canto also desribes - desire of jiva, all facilities in material world - tour what are options available.
                    5th canto to test devotees - sun is closer than moon - sunday comes before monday - what's connection - then you tell.
                    enjoyment sanctioned by Lord then demigods who say they are fed up - fulfilled but protected their spiritual desires - sthanam once more.
                            fed up of sense gratification - too much - wanna go to bharatvarsha and our desires wanna go USA.
                    3rd canto all plants tell tulsi's tapasya is greater - even bharat tapasya thought better than vaikuntha - some national ferver has come but sanskrit text so most condusive place for bhakti - in 14 plants - so congratulations.
                    among those the best place is mumbai - because so miserable.
                            why local trains you travel - free massage - don't have to tell so much.
                            material world is miserable - small town and work place is close and they were thinking speaker is frustrated.
                            entertainment so need not felt - here you try to be peaceful but opporutnities for misery.
                    Lord showing his best to protect desire of devotee for DS.

                    5th canto last chapter - on hell. 12th mahajan in hell - sadhu sang is guaranteed in material world.
                            horrifying and stories of people who left ISKCON came back after that.
                            dosage as per sin not some class.
                    Ajamila distracted by sight of prosti.
                            name of god so vishnujan came - poshanam - special care of devotees when in difficulty.
                            what management of life - enjoy bhi kiya and last moment narayan - I also have chance -

                                    what about others.

                            my dear sons - some affection to those guys.
                    Daksha - 1K sons preached and himalayas, another batch - told vedic culture follow elder brothers..agree? yes, then follow you know where they went - no - himalayas.
                            highest realization comes from personal experience - you have given brainwashing.
                            curse - never have house and always travelling - mercy - 7 why came here - gotta travel.
                            causeless mercy to give him full mercy.
                            60 daughters - safe is produce daughters then narada will not come.

                            harsha shoka - anything object apart from Krishna is that.

                Ganga Katha
                        Kapil muni - whose worship brought ganga but people don't know - people just know rituals
                        1 famous ram speaker - SP purified other places but I am very worried about my purity so carry ganga jal and put a drop b4 drinking water and maun vrata after this seminars.
                        prayag - ganga, yamuna and saraswati. 3 rivers meet.
                        Kapil Muni stays on this island.
                                he traced the path for Ganga.
                        very special place so people visit here.
                        bahuka's wife poisoned by other wives but child survived so sagar maharaj.
                                kshatriya and also great preacher.
                                all sons thought ashwamedha horse stolen by kapila instead of indra - offense so immediate reaction and heat burnt them.
                        anshumaan avadhoot son would do opposite - revived the sons. Sagar knew he is great.
                                lost and found department and found ash and kapil - unlike uncles he obeissances and prayers.
                                give my sankhya philosophy - here ashram use for ashwamedha yajna and deliver uncles thru ganga descent.
                                sagar got horse and yajna - tapasya not completed so left body, dileep could not; his son was bhagirath maharaj. Tapasya finished and ganga devi requested to descend (it took 3 generation's tapasya to get ganga devi descend) - not a small thing.
                                can do but issues - sinful people contaminate me and what to do; if no1 holds then I will go to lower planets.
                                Solution - when pure devotees will come and take bath; sins accumulated will be purified.
                                In skanda purana, dwaraka b4 Krishna leaving - many devs came - once ganga came and said she would also leave cuz kali coming and sinful people.
                                        yamuna got chance to give you bath but not me - as gauranga I and my associates will bathe in ganges.
                                        in future, 1 great devotee will make PD ew and they will take bath and purify the waters.
                                        Jayapataka M said we should not think that we are those PD - we should go there and chant Gauranga.
                                2nd question - Lord shiva will hold the force. I need 7 to be gangadhar and you have potency.
                                ganges came to earth and makar sankranti day they got delivered so they come.
                                Manifestation lila of vaaman dev - 1 leg pierced shell of universe and viraja river.
                                brahma in kamandulu and heavenly as mandakini river. Bhogavati ganga in lower planets.
                                comes thru haridwar, prayag, banaras, patna, kanai natshala, mayapur, kolkata, ganga sagar.
                Kala Kanya - SB (not a head on lecture)
                        beware of thieves - you kept him in altar if snatches then found chanting in dhoti kurta and world says gone mad.
                        Arjuna - riju means simple.
                        LCM dev line renunciation is pradhan.
                        narad knows that art of guiding
                        if audience sleeps it is also fault of speaker - vocab should be clean and full of love and present as per TPC - that art is important but will come with time.
                        listen and it will come naturally.
                        SG is naturally - it is so designed - devotee also stops but vasana is there - if get opportunity then pani puri fat se kha le par dekh raha hai.
                        shani also made mistake so curse - so don't worry on mistake continue chanting - hey not giving certi for mistakes. but don't take tension.
                        narad asked who is more beautiful lakshmi and shani - e1 knows but gotta go to kailash for pravachan so radhe radhe.
                                tell 1 then other angry so silent. yei bhaje sei chatur.
                                preeti purvakam ko dadati buddhi yogamtam - mare mare bhakti ko nahi.
                                aise kaise 100 kadam jao return ao (fashion show ke founder-acharya yahi hain)
                                decided - when going shani was beautiful and lakshmi as coming was beautiful.
                                kaam khatam patli gali kat liye - khush ho gaye liklo aur bhajan karo
                                seva karo aur nikalo.
                                Narad is very expert - how he became - HN does eth - mattah smriti jnanam apohanam ca.
                                        how much to speak - else forget mahatma gandhi called gahatma madhi.
                        Krishna and radha - who is more beautiful - e1 laughed - I am like moon you like dark night.
                                pratyaksha ko kya praman.
                        kala kanya - time (death) daughter so old age.
                                yavaneshwar - fear. old age talking to our fears - will you marry me.
                                yavan - LCM said who doesn't believe in bhagavat - bhagavan, bhakti and bhakta.
                                why gokarna only got viman not others - others ringing bells - he not only shravan but manan, nidhidhyas.
                                so thought about it - not straight forward.
                                SA 4 devs don't say kahin sun na le gadbad ho jayegi - aap bhi chahiye.
                                dhruva M - brain wash kar diya nahi mere liye le le.
                                old age is bell for death - ghanta bajta hai phir - notices sent.
                                we don't follow - jnana but ajnana doesn't leave - trinad api sunicena but if late prasadam then ugram veeram mahavishnum.
                                ishopanishad said 100 years expected but aahar vihar so many don't make it.
                                kala ke kala hain Krishna - mahakaal bhi bhakta hai bansivale ka.
                                shishupal told - my salary, free mein rasgulla khilaya wo kala meli dulhan ko leke chala gaya aur tum ga rahe the dilwale dulhaniya - ek ko nahi chhodunga.
                                                sara bill mein chuka raha hoon aur party wo le jaaye - shishupal kyun naraz nahi hoga.
                                                sabko peetunga ..maara kyun nahi - aisa hasa ham bhool gaye kuchh to coma mein hain.
                                                dheer gambheer hoke aise baithte hain jaise iske saare khandan ko hamne hi maara hai. ya sab bhagavat bhara hai.
                                        aise pyaar se bolo - wo to paap bhi kar dega seva kya.
                                6 types of laughter - smita, hasya, ...
                                        chanakya - greatest revenge against enemy is your laughter.
                                        most probs solved by laughter.
                        SB is full of jnana, etc - prayojan is prema.

            Raghunath Das Goswami
                    difficult vairagya with riches - but raghunath DG
                    how? associated with haridas thakur.
                    proof of DS is desire for SG reduces like fever reduction is sign of cure.
                    he is prayojan acharya.
                    uncle misappropriated tax funds - muslim chaudhari who wanted revenge cuz post was taken from him.
                    wanted to beat RDG but sweet face so could not - 8 lakh share he ate but give sth for me - whatever you see fit - milkar khao. Intelligent dealings are important.
                            Diplomacy can be used for Krishna's service and not SG.
                    sweet words help - zinda peer ho. he must have never opened shastra kuran. his heart melted.
                            I am like your child.
                    bind him by rope - when such sweet wife and all riches could not how will rope - he has got mercy of LCM.
                            goal of rules is get mad for Krishna - you are bona fide mad man (adhikrit paagal) - only a madman can identify another.
                    I ain't getting mercy of LCM cuz no mercy of Nitai.
                            see that thief and placed feet on his head - even demigods want dust of his lotus feet.
                            Rupa and Sanatan G escorted by Nitai to LCM.
                            Jagai Madhai - Nitai's mercy and then LCM.
                            Nitai was funny mood - anyone dandavat - he used to sit on him - we can't imitate.
                    Punishment of Cida Dahi - good seva - shouldn't get bored.
                            dhan mile na mile - bhakti milni chahiya - valuable.
                            he had all riches so arranged cida dahi - this program is just appetizer for real program afterwards.
                            Nitai and LCM exchanges - many devs could not see them - looks crazy talking in air.
                            Raghav Pandit said you said food at my place - will take at your place in evening. I am cowherd I like such settings.
                            shopkeepers returned their raw material back as prasadam - good biz.
                    activity < consciousness - RDG said - first disqualification expression and then plea or want for mercy expression.
                            I like a dwarf could not touch the moon. Made many attempts but not successful caught by parents.
                            w/o your mercy no1 can attain mercy of LCM - guru tattva is necessary, then Krishna.
                            SP - bhakti nahi ved nahi...your insignificant beggar.
                            no qualification to take name of God - gotta approach proper channel like saying modi modi won't help me meet.
                            deho krishna naam dhane.
                            Nitai laughed he has enjoyments like indra but doesn't like that (that's sign of bhakti advancement)
                                    Eg - Yamunacharya - I think of SG after Krishna - feel like spit distaste.
                            even brahmalok not interesting
                                    dharti ke upar lok - he keep going so he would know ...I mean preaching.
                                    they renounce it like shit - don't feel sad about it.
                                    ar kabe nitaichander karuna haibe; samsara vaasana mora kabe tucch habe.
                            Nitai asked him to take blessings from all vaishnavas - guru tattva is most important but vaishnavas also.
                            Yadunandan his shiksha guru - pujari didn't come gotta wake him up.
                                    he ran thru opposite direction so that no suspicion and thru jungles.
                                    chant gauranga - nirjala was a day before but looks like you are continuing.
                                    he ran 40 Km per day - 12 days he ran. milk chane - prasad once in 4 days we kae 4 times a day only grammar difference.
                                    LCM said Krishna took you out of life of shit (life of bondage)
                                            I don't know Krishna but know GN.
                                            He is like my nana's bro so I st joke him don't mind it...he is devotee but not pure devotee so I said so.
                            All living entities get attached from insect to Indra
                                    Eg - Indra cursed to be pig but attached - jiva starts liking the life in species.
                                    Eg - Kailash Bhakti Karo - 
                            Gaura Rasayan - no that's my copyright my customers will go to you.
                                    will complete cuz prasadam after this and a lotta ways open after prasadam.
                    Started staying at Jagannath Puri
                            at gate he eats shak phal mool.
                            not at gate also - vishay ki bhavna - this dev good fed me and that not good - prosti mentality.
                            started eating like food for life
                            father sent money and but stopped after stopped days.
                            cow won't eat that - no internet know I am vairagi - would clean and salted then eat - LCM snatched and ate - never as tasty as 56 meals - tasting renunciation.
                            gave govardhan shila like Krishna and Gunja mala like Radhika.
                            wanted to suicide so permission from Rupa and Sanatan - you stayed with LCM for 16 years so tell stories - KDK also took notes as CC.
                            Badrinath in dream - give donation to RDG for Radha Kund - good way of fund raising.
                            japa and lion but no disturbance so Krishan shood away - stop taking services
                            sakhi sthali of chandravali - kheer khai - doctor you have bogus diagnostic he doesn't even eat khicadi - I ate in dhyan - I will offer in mind - eat in mind also.
                    wrote poems and manah shiksha - virah lila of Rupa made him cry and became weak vs milan lila then happy.
            Gangamata Goswamini
                    refused to marry cuz of attachment to Krishna. ruled for some time.
                    sleep on yamuna bank and clean govindji temple.
                    became beggar asking for alms in braj.
                    guru instructed to lakshmi priya dasi disciple of shri haridas.
                    chanted 192 round ed - govardhan hill prakshina ed and worship Krishna.
                    at puri, high class deity worhsip and katha attracted e1 from miles.
                            many including kings took initiation from gangadevi.
                            ?desired ganga - ganga took her to altar - thought to be thief - Lord appeared in 2 dreams - king and pujari.
            Baladev Vidyabhushan (1670-1768)
                    near remuna orissa.
                    youth went to udupi and initiated in madhav sampradaya.
                    preached thru india and came back to orissa - Radha Damodar swami - great grand disciple of shyamanand pandit.
                    then studied under VCT.
                    Ramanuja line complained that RG worshippers not genuine cuz no bhashya on Vedanta.
                            pujari feared so took matter to VCT - parampara be genuine.
                            VCT too old to travel - so shiksha disciple BVB asked to go there.
                            BVB said LCM accepted SB as Vedanta bhasya.
                            ok gimme few days and I will present a bhasya.
                            he prayed to RG deities - please help me to save your reputation.
                            RG came in dream - I will guide you from heart.
                            called Govind Bhasya cuz Govind dictated - BVB moved.
                            Ramanuja line people could not find any defect so accepted.
                            Vidyabhushan title given at that time
                            Ramanujis requested to be initiated in his line - you already belong to genuine sampradaya so no need - all sampradayas are good and all lead to same goal of feet of Krishna.
                            VCT informed about this jaipur lila.
                    BVB became guide of Gaudiya vaishnavas.
                    SP - BG dedicated to BVB.
            Vrindavan Das Thakur
                    aparadh bandh so no tears.
                    Knowledge source
                            4 shastra pramanic on LCM - CC by KDK, CB by VDT, CM by LDT, Caitanya Charitra mahaKavya in Sanskrit by murari gupta over 20 days.
                            Caitanya Mangal named as Caitanya Bhagavat; 
                            knowledge source - murari gupta (childhood and school) and svarup damodar at Jagannath Puri to Rupa G (LCM arranged)
                                    Raghunath Das from Rupa G -> KDK that's documented.
                    BG voice of Lord and surrender is essence. SB starts with that point what lord does. CC what Lord thinks.
                    Facts
                            Kavi Karnapura says Vrindavan Das Thakur is same as Vyas dev and kusum pid boyfriend of Krishna. 
                            When LDT published with same name then VDT changes the name.
                    This book will purify the readers. SP - not me, it's Krishna's book.
                            inspire (prerna) no Krishna dictated.
                            SP said established in Bengali, Hindi and English - west, vrindavan and mayapur.
                                    we be puppets kathputli or pipe to become a medium.
                    LCM said sarvatra pracar horibo moro naam - VDT did it.
                    mother name narayani - ed kirtan so srivas praying to narsingha. LCM tahal roaming on ganges - like prince. He stood in front the one you worship is me. 
                            I won't inspire him to come. If he does I will challenge kazis to weep animals but I will make them also cry - see narayani 4 years old lass - ecstatic symptoms - st avoiding to hear himself as Krishna st showing the aishwarya bhav.
                            grace and that KC range was published by VDT.
                            vatsalya bhav - ambika's sister - kilambika was manifest as narayani
                    Vaikuntha nath vipra - father didn't meet a lot and also in kula of srivas's wife.
                    initiation from Nitai. once in denur, ram hari seen by nitai SM - hari taki VDT gave eftsoon - where it came from (similar to govind dutt's pastime with LCM) - you accumulate (sangrah) so be here (grihasta by LCM)
                            But spared pastime of Sanatan Goswami - Ishan 1 Re saved. Today no1 will be left. No faith in Krishna that he will provide (dependence). 
                            1 Mahatma in mountains and got hot halwa there also.
                            Kurma Pr - vrindavan guys so home bookings in dehradun after first day.
                            Giriraj M in Boston - less money from working - 2 hrs for 10-12 Dollars - kirtans SP says and started getting money.
                            Indradyumn M - Thakurji first class service and temple maintenance by him.
                            Shrivas - LCM said keep his account no work you do - God will do - if not, I will fast. 2nd day - will fast. 3rd day - then ganges that he doesn't give. if not, then will jump what else. You will be provided.
                            SP says serving Krishna and Krishna takes care - no money but first class prasadam all in butter; these days we have money but not first class prasadam.
                            Malathi Mataji - no butter for SP so stole butter for bhog and SP saw - SP asked how you managed tasty prasadam - she revealed - Krishna also butter thief.
                            2nd temple in San Fransisco no money and winter coming - no grocery - money coming flying in air - it comes with wind just catch he says.
                            so he stayed back there and manifested CB there - not unhappy with Nitai.
                    ?KDK - on Nitai, carit became too much so latter pastime stopped there - parampara raksha by KDK. KDK completed the remaining lila not covered by VDT.
                            Narad Ji parampara raksha not that Vyas dev didn't know.
                            but bhagavat was taught - sanakadi rishi says mango tree and mango fruits are different.
                            Knowledge doesn't come to value like salt water ocean - but cloud water of vedas in form of SB are valuable.
                            his deity went to his disciples who went smartha.
                    Srivas's son gone so enliven when don't disturb LCM.
                    anyone minimizes position of Nitai - that's great offender.
                    devotees commentary on pastimes makes Lord's activities very relishable. That's the way.
                    every bhajan gets tested at time of death. Deities are dressing themselves thru you. Krishna sends just enough money for projects.
                    not technique in devotion development but follow in parampara.

        <Others> All inspirational SB talks in temple
                Devotee needs to focus on in ISKCON
                        security, appreciation, 
                                dependence on krishna, self worth, 
                                extremes avail in scriptures but it takes tattva darshinah to find golden mean
                                trapeze artist - devotees are Krishna's property and should be taken care of nicely - materially, etc.
                                nothing official about care - it should percolate and permeate on its own - it is infectious.
                        satisfaction - gajendra in foreign situation fighting made him very weak.
                        direction - without spirituality, it is shallow struggle for existence.
                                counselor - LCM had svarupa's raghu - guru is busy so counselor for shiksha and guidance.
                        socialization - relationship with world and each other - belonging and cooperation
                                sometimes we just need a hand and ear to hear you.
                                opulence - natural resource and loving relationship people who are willing to die for .
                                        riches in today's age, even spiritual world.
                                materially well situated is misunderstood as janma, shut, aishwarya, shribhir - whatever it takes for devotee to be protected, inspired, encouraged, active throughout life.
                                        all of them map to the needs mentioned.
                                        ISKCON Chowpatty - no, I am from Gopinath. 
                                        Creation phase you have to be in MOP and then you should come to MOG.
                        not institution but movement - it should move forward.
                                there is 1 sect with only 20 strictest practitioners of christianity in world and if you can't connect then leave - Who can showcase better than Krishna - why yogic systems, why 12 th chapter if not this, then that.
                                SP focussed on ultimate on vyasasan (no question of divorce) but personal dealings - ok, I can do.
                                parampara all about eyes on cloud, feet on ground - dynamic application of TMC.
                        Levels - we don't reject them as fallen souls but accept them at that level and support them.
                                My mission is HK.
                                My life is HK
                                I am HK (on sundays)
                                Well-wishers - I like HK
                                Inquisitive - what is HK
                                Svaroop Damodar Pr - got blessings
                                All institutions have conservatives and liberals - conserve principles and liberals are concerned about details. 
                                        conservative about detail is fanatic and hardliners. Liberals when liberal about principles then compromised, deviated and diluted.
                                        fixed and realized to take that call - not e1 can do that preaching.
                                        belief in astrology - different levels from 0 to 1, there is an international society.
                                why you said that - in what context you said that, when I said, what i said.
                                        kanthi tilak and wrong practice - has a wrong side but imitation of good people does them some good.
                                Shudra, vipra, brahmin - all levels are there.
                                sometimes we follow 1 principle and we break another one - guru smiled and mangoes growing in my land - in addition to mango also guru has to give love of god - hint at it.
                                        accha aadmi tha HK wala
                                        eg - blasted a devotee doing dandavat in front of God - 1 principle to not bow, another to now be angry in front of deities.
                nand going to kans for tax giving so that no suspicion others may get.
                Parokshavad - indirect preaching by narad to puranjan. better say enigmatic preaching.
                        navayogendras to nimi - vedas are full of it - preaching fruitive activities and purpose is to give freedom from it.
                        sugarcoated medicine. father promises candy in exchange of medicine.
                        Krishna says all brahma vishay - but many subcategories like karma, jnana - I like paroksha way very much.
                        LCM - that person has stolen my heart; I want to go to that tree - nothing devotional directly and public platform - 7 may find disturbing - sanyasi apparently singing song which looks like bollywood song. But enigmatic meaning is understood by Rupa G.
                                connected with Krishna - then Yukta vairagya - definition by Rupa G and he explains the meaning of LCM's statement - he used no identified objects like not kadamba tree but ashoka tree.
                        Advaita acharya - e1 has become mad like LCM. He should know that rice is present in every home now and no1 is buying - meaning his external purpose is served here now focus on internal mission. He was the one who sent invitation letter to Krishna so he will decide the program being the host.
                        for Krishna's descent Brahma went to his place - he approached Vishnu milk ocean - viz temple. Although Krishna is everywhere.
                                but in beginning Brahma didn't go - he was in darkness at time of birth.
                        abhishta siddi (obtain anything desired) - vidhi should be anukul. anukul means banks of pool. MOP (Brahma) and MOI (Shiva) anukul (became favorable or approached banks) of MOG (Vishnu) - so samadhi became perfect vishnu is visible now.
                        Why Krishna appeared in vasudev's mind - gopal you become when trained under or go to a gopal - go means senses and paal means protector - so mind he went.
                        more loving than father is grandfather and so on - Krishna born in chandra vansha. It is manasa jatah - so Krishna appeared before to the mind than to Chandra - experience more love before.
                        maya birth - took shelter of vishnu pad - sky. She left and Kansa came to senses.
                        why putana form of beautiful lady with ornaments - gokul means collection of senses - to put the collection in illusion - all of them - then hema and angana - gold and woman.
                        king of universe demonstrated how to fight like a king - attack when enemy is weak - when Krishna killed demon from below (?the cart) - stay silent until opportune moment comes.
                        Krishna is complete but wants to taste the sweetness of devotee's heart (or breast in the case of mother yashoda) - so when denied then damodar lila.
                                harda rasa.
                        Krishna vanished during rasa dance - within the heart - when pride for devotees, he is antarhit for the world what's surprise with devotees.
                        Alankar - help poetry a lot - but hari Suri says for a woman, kumkum ornament is sufficient as fortune - so like my poetry presence of Krishna is enough.
                        Lord's instructions are more important than his actions - maybe difficult to decode.
                                if not understood, then explore all explanations - else wait for some inspiration that makes complete sense but won't speak it - speaking from previous acharya is perfect - transparent translator - that's my approach.
                        mukhya meaning and guana meaning - we also speak gauna meaning - prateekatmaka vyakhya - SP says Krishna is krishak and uproot weeds.
                                Impersonalists reduce the prateekatmaka to 1 dimension to strip historical meaning from it - acharyas won't do that - secondary add lot of flavor.
                                primary meaning is for tattva and kavya brings rasa - hidden meaning. Indicated meaning - dhvanit artha is very important in kavya and SB is kavya.
                                Radha says to crow - going to mathura tell mathuranath - fire in the house, animal wants to escape but lock so can't so please come and open it so that animal can leave - meaning my life is caught in the fire of separation and lock of your promise isn't letting it leave.
                        Gokul is very perturbed today, Krishna when leaving mathura - meaning - collection of all senses very perturbed.
                        when acharyas commentaries go against each other - don't eat in front of lord vs can eat but don't eat paan or beetle nuts.
                                how to avoid such direct contradictions - don't think any one of them is wrong both are acharyas if you can't reconcile with both of them then.
                                Jiva G vs Vishvanath Chakravathi - whom to follow - Baladev Vidyabushan solution is udit anudit homa nyaya (he doesn't explain now you think)
                                it is nyaya sutra of gautam rishi - yajna after sunrise else dogs eat offerings ; before sunrise else another set of dogs will eat your offerings.
                                        solution - you stick to one part you will get results of that part and not get negative result of the other.
                                SP says there is no reason that acharyas cannot differ on 1 point.
                        merit of kavya and merit of mundane - fine line where it is differentiable
                                Rupa G - nirbandha Krishna sambandhe - 7 sees Krishna somewhere where the other doesn't - different maturity level of different devotees.
                                first day devotee told that brahmacari went to US in airplane - he will be bewildered. Any kavya but if you see Krishna then nice.
                                SP said he saw Krishna in lamp post. Prahlad M in pillar - for me, I can see only if you draw on that pillar.
                                LCM sees Krishna sambandha very clearly - chandidas borderline, vidyapati direct, kalidas raghuvansh but meghdoot has no connection.
                                you venture - gotta have taste, adhikar, etc.
                                        some like toned milk, some diluted, some normal, some condensed milk - so accordingly.
                        milk touched by serpent not to be taken?
                                milk is nutritious, tasty and nice - it is the touch by a mayavad and all that makes it poisonous.
                                no excuse - be expert at understanding mayavad, brahmavad, pratibimbavad, parichedvaad. when impersonal interpretation is given then don't accept it.
                                bad eg - Ra is Brahma and M is jiva - the joy of they coming together is present in the name of lord ram. Devotees rejoice in his name so ram.
                casinos - winning is more dangerous - cuz more investment later on.
                        mushti-krida - let other win and one go finish it off
                        bhaja govinda song got composed outta compassion - seeing person trying to remember some grammar in early morning instead of god's name.
                        jara 4 letters - white hair, eyesight, teeth, bending body.
                        Shiva - virupaksha - 3 eyes.
                        jnana and vairagya - kya bhakti inse viheen hai? good for entry - a little is required to go on and 64 limbs of DS don't count them.
                                NOD book is being made means that jnana is important
                                LCM converted grammar to Krishna's connection.
                                bhakti poshak jnani is very important.
                                too much jnana without Krishna - aranya roditam and upavas, etc is med chhedam (fat removal program)
                                bhakti se jnana and vairagya aata hai ya inke saath bhakti karni hai - chant HK and be happy - is 1 instruction or 2.
                                        bhakti anand deti hai ya karen anand ke saath - susukham kartum avyayam.
                                        is it causal or parallel phenomenon - it is both!!
                                in spiritual world or bhulok vrindavan - to not know is opulence. Not that they don't know they know but in condense love the superiorness gets hidden.
                                        fear of them getting hurt is sign of love. They used to play with largest ox, horned animals, fire trying to touch, sharped jawed animals.
                        SP focussed on tattva - in India, people talk a lot about lila but not tattva.
                                high selling somewhere - condensing is not our parampara but expanding it.
                                condensed SB - purpose is coming to vast SB - bird view - vihang drishya.
                                playing with swords, jumping into water. pulling bird's tails, etc. thorns in parks, etc.
                Can Devotees make mistakes
                        Bhim to Yudhisthir - 14th day let's fight and see who comes in middle - they are also strong and also, huge force they have.
                        he stays cool and handles the situation.
                        yudhisthir comes back to camp and expects arjuna to do sth with karna - I wanted to see you are safe. Emotional outburst - you should not taken birth; gandiva only a show; I took you as basis for fight.
                        can devotees make mistakes? Arjuna forgot BG - whoever asks me to take down gandiva will be killed in front of his teacher.
                                bad words to ruler is like death - you are gambler, etc.
                                yudhisthir thought cuz of me eth happening so I go to jungle - so another BG required now.
                        In BG, Krishna says even small mistakes biggest fears you are absolved from. Marketing - even if it falls (not that no1 dies in our hospital), it remains shreshtha.
                                those who honor prasadam after class make more advancement cuz get to see prasadam as it is.
                                bhautik and spiritual should go together - 1 in the way of other doesn't help.
                        Uttanpad more bent (pasand) towards suruchi - nothing wrong with that - natural and obvious like player.
                                but when your pasand starts causing troubles to others then it's a problem - suruchi wanted mileage outta liking.
                                        exploit someone's weakness - dependent on me.
                                yudhisthir liked gambling - nothing wrong but prepared set up for mahabharat.
                                Kaikeyi knew she is loved more - even very happy when Ram is gonna be king - there was a seed inside her against kaushalya - that was being cultured.
                                he said let Ram break his vow but not himself cuz loved kaikeyi - so even exalted devotees make mistake.
                        Duryodhan was master of exploitations - what's weakness and how to make most outta that - Bhishma's weakness of loyalty to crown.
                                Anger induce to bhishma - vowed to never kill pandavas - MOP took over and said with these 5 arrow I will kill them. Anger outburst but Krishna handles.
                                Draupadi protected by Krishna - e1 realized sth special with her - not ordinary lady. So, Dhritarashtra came to senses and asked Draupadi for favors.
                                        but how much attachment it takes that Dhritarashtra again calls for another gambling match.
                                Duryodhan orchestrated the situation to take place again.
                        Dhruva M - 1 yaksha and you kill that one but you are killing all.
                        Hanuman set whole lanka on fire - fear of sita being affected. He got carried away and forgot about it.
                        dead snake on his neck - did I make mistake that he wanted to avoid a guest. realized his mistake.
                                Shringi was trained brahmin. had power; shyamik also had but also had culture and civilization of knowing what to do when.
                                Shringi very down - you should think before doing anything. you need to know whom you curse and consequences. very easy to find faults.
                                Parikshit qualities and abilities that saw Krishna in womb and chastised kali but shringi focussed all attention on 1 small wrong work.
                                sensitive dealing - go and inform him about this - he could have become angry, retaliated, could have asked to cancel.
                        son tells father - you not rich so I suffer but ignores how much his father perseveres for him.
                        Juhu pastime of SP can be seen as a pastime but also as a mistake - so much energy had to be put there later on.
                        Prithu M - 100 sacrifice record breaking then Indra behaved certain way. can such exalted devotee act like that - yes, says SB.
                                it is easy to say 99 run pe out ho jao. chanting on fasting day - 107 rounds or 99 - so unhappy next day.
                                Prithu M forgives him - I understand galti ho sakti hai.
                        1 person to RNSM - I like debates and fight till kill the other person - I don't like it but most often I win.
                                change a person by forgiving him. who first bows becomes challenge - but 1 does other must.
                        those who can manage in ISKCON can manage anywhere - rules am I offending, voluntary it is, emotions and bhakti involved.
                                aparadh ho gaya then do sth about it.
                                IIM walla chakra jaayega.
                                RNSM - success of leader of community is how sensitively or maturely you deal with mistakes.
                                        maturely involves - punishment, community has to be protected, give him something else, etc.
                        choice is between being suruchi or suniti, being shaunik or shringi, prithu or indra.
                                suniti is unspoken hero - doesn't make mistakes. treated like maidservant. Dhruva told no takleef to those who offended. seeing his nature doesn't say tolerate but please Vishnu and deal with it.
                                Dhruva when came back then received first by suruchi.
                                kaikeyi acted even against experience cuz mental impressions took over.
                Police can discipline few unruly people but whole society can't be.

    <PersonalNotes>
            Philosophy - People who associate high cost are generally supposed to be good situated (and they get their high cost out there in society)
                    reasonably high cost ensures a need for improvement - yes, it is desire (MOP) Platform which is a valid reason for pursuit.
                    too high cost - a person thinks of leaving the game or the improvements over time may go unnoticed.
                    people are beware of those who make issue out of small thing - the narrative is determined by bottlenecks.
                    once more, "if you want peace then be prepared for war". Why do you think Brahmins in India become easy targets in bollywood.
                    being chill is an opulence but not compromising	attitude is definitely required.
                    Spontaneity - The idea is not paralysis in analysis. Do what you would (with natural mind nourished by intelligence from different sources) as per spontaneity with mild thought over it.
                            And retrospection on it again in KC for lessons and thereby gradient descent.
            Philosophy - Strong desire for something is at the heart of it.
            Philosophy - why exaggerate some incident
                    cumulation then big retaliation for small stimulus. different degreees of tolerance for somebody's anarthas. misinterpretations. Things are not black or white but gray.
                    you can share your experience as input and that's all - let the other person still follow ye yatha maam prapadyante.
                    but the focus should always be not on what all is wrong or the problem but how it can be solved.
            DS doesn't mean low cost and permitting being stepped - it is just changing the criteria of cost function from yourself to KC.
            Spirituality - If on/off in KC enthu, what it means with power on/off - connection is weak. but we are connected, get more.
            Spirituality
                    VA - Reasons why a devotee should perform his/her occupational duties nicely (pls add your reason to this list):
                            1. To set a good example in society, Grihastas are the face of ISKCON Singh as being responsible towards material duties outsiders will be inspired to take up Krishna consciousness
                            2. While performing our occupational duty, we will face many challenges and being steady in KC during those tough times will increase our faith in Krishna which in turn will help us to do our Bhakti more seriously.
                            3. Varnashram is Krishna's system not ours.
                            4. Krishna says without occupational duty you can't even maintain this body.
                            5. One definition of maya is to see things in disconnect from Krishna. Nothing is separate from Krishna especially his social ideology.
                            6. Krishna consciousness is process of gradual  evolution not artificial compulsion.
                            7. My experience is it keeps us busy in stretch zone and prevents us from spaced out zone and bad habits and fall down and extra sense gratification. Also the problem which initial phase of ISKCON devotees's nature was not seen and neglected. Govind pr says we have to practice bhakti according to our nature.
                            8. Very good 7th point just add to that - find higher expressions of life - jump is not from sense gratification to spiritual but there are stages and ignoring them and not addressing "our" needs will simply takes us to the fallback of lower layers of gratifications because of soul's nature of ananda-mayo'bhyasat. To go from 1 floor to another is not one long jump but a few strategic and systematic steps on the ladder. 
                            9. Interestingly that process becomes more enjoyable that way cuz in alignment with our current nature (svabhav). Apparently even without kc a person will do the same course of action but that's the difference between Arjuna's fight and Duryodhana's fight - same war, similar preparation, similar sincerity, similar enthusiasm but different purposes.
                            9. Escaping your duties comes in mode of ignorance which is not favorable for Krishna consciousness. Let's be in mode of goodness - most favorable platform.
                            In the World and evolve so that not of the world or in other words, does not belong to this world but much superior in standards.
                            10. To practice spirituality without reference to shastrik suggestions is simply disturbance to oneself amd society - utpat eva kalpate. Do austerity of sincerity if not natural. Pick a varna and ashram life that's in accordance to your nature so that it is enjoyable and beneficial for you - preyas and shreyas.
                            11. Our emotions are a great help - don't overlook them, deny them. Use fear, desire, duty, love - all faculties to be in alignment with "what is" (tattva) - not just materially but spiritually. Krishna tells Arjuna if you are transcendental to material realm then you should still not mind doing occupational duties. Krishna himself does his duties else he says will cause disturbance to society cuz eg people follow.
                            12. Life in VA helps us get quick rewards for attitude of service which is soul's constitutional nature. It also exposes anarthas in us for us to do our spiritual homework. Seeing others, it gives us forum to see spiritual principles at work and need for spirituality. Also, good for penetrative preaching, besides direct one.
                            13. Because Srila Prabhupad, founder Acharya of our society perfected his occupational duty at every stage of his life. He was an expert student, an hard working businesses man, parivrajakacharya at such a ripe age and even towards his last days on this planet Earth SP was translating SB. At the highest stage of KC, SP did not need to do this but I feel SP just showed by his example that whatever occupational duty we are in, we must do justice.
                            14. Personally, being selfish I do it so that I can keep my mind engaged as I don't have enough taste in holy name in which I can invest full-time. Even if I get enough money but where will I put mind in positive activity? With this I get money which I use for charity, as dharma says for grihasthas. Also, this money is used for livelihood, which if goes fine gives me satisfaction and peace of mind to practise Bhakti.
                            May by blessings of devotees I get taste in holyname.
                            15. Ramanand Rai suggested Varnashram as a tool for perfection - Chaitanya Mahaprabhu declared it as peripheral but didn't reject it. It may be slow but it's acknowledged. Varnashram is also a facility to enjoy independent of Krishna while maintaining some alignment. Devotees just carry out this alignment in Krishna consciousness. Janak Maharaj got perfection simply by carrying out occupational duties in Krishna consciousness - being neutral in personal pain and pleasure and concerned primarily with Krishna's pleasure.
                            16. Conditional duties and stability create a platform on which Krishna consciousness can be carried out sustainably and aggressively. Peace of mind is very favorable for spirituality than agitated mind. To acknowledge spiritual constitutional dharma and not conditional dharma is premature understanding and is potentially dangerous cuz spirituality ain't a sprint but a marathon. Let's not forget that we are soul with subtle and gross body in a conditioned state of existence. Just remembering that we are soul and forgetting other layers of our current existence is incomplete understanding. We should respect Krishna's creation including processes set up not just design aspects.
                            17. 1 very important point. Krishna consciousness doesn't decide anything for you. It just advocates principles which can hold sacred in your life to the degree of your convictions. Your life is entirely your own to make. We don't surrender our intelligence but surrender with intelligence. Let's not blame Krishna for lost opportunity or so but take full inventory of Krishna's instructions and yathecchasi tatha kuru. More aligned action will be more rewarding but you decide and choose that consciously and accept the consequences as a package. Krishna consciousness is not 0 or 1 but gradient descent of intelligent being from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness. So, if you want to do something, KC isn't there to stop you or decide for you but guide you without restricting your free will; you may restrict your free will for promised higher rewards but KC won't, Krishna however can (out of his unconditional and inconceivable love for jivas).
                            18. Occupational duty is so important that in 1 Prabhupada lecture I heard that one should "rather work for free than to not work. Of course, out of compassion master will give some remuneration." Vasudhaiva kutumbakam is more important than self obsession. Identification of Krishna as the center of attraction is even more important but not everyone can do that.
            Spirituality
                    Expression of rebellion
                            Anything illusory grats of lower layer Krishna has given, he also has right to revoke and even show realities of material nature as inversion of sat-cit-ananda.
                            Here also alignment to tattva is important. When you have seen "high", "low"s hit equivalently hard. That's why cultivation of MOG is so important.
                            the reverse is also true. in pashcattap you show "low" of some layers, so the craving for "high" increases or at least when given a chance, the starved attitude can play bad.
                            idea of pashcattap is not live in "low" but have an ideal ecosystem for prayaschit, jnana cultivation and pursuit of higher tastes.
                            MOP is a great help for starting of anything - but eventually it has to stabilize to MOG - scrum can be of great help here.
                                    Every pursuit is questioned as how it serves your ego.
                                    A separate session for how your targetted egos are engaged in service, helping in service, creating ecosystem for stability s.t service can take place, etc 
                                            prana - engaged directly, artha - money for mental stability, charity , dhiya - helps me connect, relate, go deeper in Jnana yoga, vaca - richer vocabulory and data models process models or underlying maths help convey KC better.
                                            Fear, desire, duty, love - stability of mind; charity, for people to look up to spiritually elevated being exemplary; life of Krishna's ideals; Krishna's nature is non-different from Krishna (see Krishna's spark of splendor in those things, glorify Krishna in a certain ways; some direct services thru your varna like DB for devs)
                                                    how emotions wrt VA are a great help in KC.
                    Ability to control influx of desire for certain emotion - like an ocean water comes but level doesn't rise - MOG so you know where everything fits - not denying them but fitting them in their right place and in right amounts. Eg - drugs can be good medicine but not good habit.
            Spirituality
                    7's anarthas showing up at work (unwillingness to solve their component) - satyameva jayate so face the situation and let facts take over.
                            be so talented (arch level) that you do not really depend on someone else - you can solve it on your own cuz solving customer's problem is far more important than petty shits.
                            impressions are important but not more important than hardcore services (Krishna's ideology)
                                    political correctness at cost of actual correctness and actual correctness at cost of political correctness
                                    why go for 01 and 10 when you should go for 11 - find a way for 11 even if it is a tradeoff and not pure 11 (it can be like 0.8,0.8 which is fine)
                                    actual correctness in general should weight far more than political correctness cuz 1. which lives longer and has long term impact. 2. what's Krishna's ideology - actual reason for work.
                                    and yes even outside of spirituality there's a lot of tolerating other people's anarthas involved. Don't hate it, be sympathetic towards it.
            Spirituality
                    SQGrats - Ambarish Pr - embrace from him after giving some donation to TOVP - he said thank you so much. Probably his MMPrasad also.
                            Altar cleaning seva - oil removal, mopping with acaman, etc.
                    Levels - Goloka Vrindavan, Bhulok Vrindavan or pilgrimage places, Temples (or BC), VOICE (Temple extension, BACE, CHOICE), Lotus VOICE (VOICE extension).
            Spirituality
                    The manifestation of internal (subtle) realm has consequences in material realm - you bow down to your teacher has an impact although you already had it in your heart but bowing down and reciprocation starts material things. Similarly, ucchishta or MMPrasadam - you would take given a chance great attitude but when you get it it's awesome and visible effects.
                    smart people understand anarthas manifest in the subtle body itself before material manifest.
            Spirituality - Mind solution - ignore it (get on with important tasks), cajjole it (persuade for something), subdue it (thru logic, reasons, etc)
            Spirituality
                    high position in an institution gives the institution high stake wrt to that person's thoughts and words and actions.
                    ISKCON - it is the society that we are talking - don't think of how wonderful I am - well in some dimensions you may inspire others and vv ; still some role models may inspire you within the field that you are inspirational for others. 
                            So, it is society and how wonderful idea that is.
                            the distributed network of KC - Krishna sends centralized personalities to inspire us. love expression, how valuable 1 devotee can be. setting a principle.
                                    even during the time of that devotee of central devotee there would be many who may inspire us in certain ways or maybe case studies worth considering.
                    corruption of layers - the conception of wrong comes from higher layer
                            ego - taking undesirable role cuz you want it even if it's wrong
                                    eg - some nasty doctors putting in problems to make money and so on. Overpricing is not that - that's economics.
                            intellect - justifying desired conclusion even if that's wrong (or undesirable on highest layer) ...you know it.
                                    eg - road accident justifications, using BG to put forth your philosophy or your decisions which are anti to its teaching.
                            mind - undesirable enjoyment even if that's against the highest layer.
                            senses - indulgence into pleasures that don't spoil the highest layer.
                            interim corruptions - indugence of senses into something that is unfavorable to ego and so on - but that's not called corruption - you can use some other name.
            Spirituality - SB
                    how do you manage so many service - I just delegate right services to right people.
                    praying to god - preaching in your hand - i fail then lotta antipreaching
                    many people like arto artharthi episodes of Krishna - but listen to Pandav episodes and think if that's same Krishna.
                            vipatti is devotee's sampatti - remember him in every situation.
                            my success - proud; my failure - discouraged; other's success - jealous, other's failure - nindatmaka.
                                    but purpose is Krishna's remembrance in every situation so Kirtaniya sada hari.
                                    bhramit ho jaate hain situations mein - LCM gave personal eg and acharyas for reading on how that's possible.
                                    seniors pleased then their santosh gives you blessings.
                            surrender - seva, desire to please, let go of unfavorable, etc that's sharanagati.
                                    instructions ke aage tucch hona padta hai
                                    inconceivable potency is in action, that creates impact and service becomes impressive.
                                    you are not alone - whole sampradaya there for you but gotta approach - like police or ambulance or fire always waiting but gotta call.
                            kitchen not that bhakti bhaav - nikalna hai but not on face - there 1 person coming - no problem, you there right?
                                    so much you doing - ghis rahe hain chandan ki tarah - LCM mission mein jalkar raakh ho jayenge.
                    vaishnava means eternally hopeful
                            gundica marjanam - many pots broke but not fought - favorable or unfavorable only 1 question how do I serve.
                            surrender but happy - 3 steps - speak to Krishna that I am yours; mind in that direction that I am yours; actions in that direction (so speech, mind and actions in that direction)
                            how can I please you...who is you - it's ocean of devotees - drown in that ocean...surrounded by devotees then maya can't enter.
                                    matbhed in seva - working midst that environment is yoga. become flexible in your desires - preparation for spiritual world it is.
                                    SA 3rd verse becomes very natural doing services - that helps your chanting.
                            India spirituality is like loss in profit vs world tour and then you will be happy - even if chastised devotee, you will embrace at least there is devotee.
                                    aapko apna nahi duniya ka sochna hai - start thinking about bigger problem and small problems become insignificant.

                    proof or sign of living thing is empowered to defy the natural laws of physics.
                            spiritual humanism vs material humanism - let's see who wins.
                            not tolerate (that's problem covered) other religions or respect (that's diplomatic) but recognize their ways to evolve.
                            principle oriented hinduism - not live with each other (live and let live - don't step on others toes is commerce) - live for each other.
                    Uddhava Gita is Arjuna Gita multiplied by 1K times - yadus gonna fight and can do nth about and also that Krishna is leaving.
                            material world pains and pleasures are just opportunities to take shelter of Krishna.
                    Parikshit M leaving in humiliating way - whole life for respecting devotees and cursed by 8 yr old boy and brahmanas (loved by Krishna) - that causes finishing.
                            all siddhis yogis used not for prajalpa but highest purpose of life.
                            pastimes are also questions what you would do in that situation.
                    what's good is so relative and they are right - economics, politics, drugs, education, nice spouse, to conquer, supernatural powers, heavens, etc.
                            all these goals have paths and recommendations in scriptures.
                            different states of minds so different desires and versions of "good" - 4 siblings and asked different things from Brahma - Ravan, Kumbhakarna, Vibhishan and shurpanakha.
                            perfection of jnana yoga is vasudev sarvam iti and perfection of ashtanga - fixed in me.
                    Brahma understood value of Krishna - blade of grass for devotees to step on and not even expecting Krishna and Radha to step on - later on sometime my fortune.
            Spirituality
                    VA system is to enable jivas to enjoy separate from him - but retaining their constitutional position as much as possible.
                            so is it sinful to watch multimedia?
                            there are hints for evolution and possibilities of fall from that platform - that's where after life evolution comes into place.
                            VA system is system of service - mutual for creating a culture of equivalent exchange.
                            As per VA system, you are supposed to pay the price of karma to get to karma phal.
                            with advent of standardizing services out of emotional realm - like ability to trigger emotions through worldly talks or prajalpa or gramya katha.
                                    it is advertisements or case studies of hypothetical real world and are supposed to be second hand experience of real emotion 
                                            so it creates or updates cost functions for enjoyment and displeasure and thus assist your evolution on choosing the right course of action.
                                            You may even be misled by this second hand experience of hypothetical life.
                                    this is not held very glorious
                                            from spiritual standpoint you are supposed to already know what's right and wrong course of actions and pay the price for worldly emotions
                                                    does that mean you are anti-economics - no, although economics is only a worldly thing 
                                                            but being driven by MOP of any layer simply steals your time as matter of fact so gotta keep it under check and balance.
                                            what about case studies - so discussion on tattva is not discouraged but idle triggering of emotions is acts in MOP
                                                    head on talks about scenarios is far more important than thru stories - recall Vyasadev transcribed stories for common public to develop interest.
                                                    of course those stories are also Krishna centered so can't compare them with worldly talks or hypothetical stories.
                                            they are not sinful but not deemed very crucial or high either.
                                    conclusion - keep it under balance and focus more on philosophical side of things.
                                    these services may advertise sinful activities as glorious and are not good for your mental sanskars, they even influence vrittis and strengthen vasanas.
                                            eg - infatuation with opposite gender is quite common theme in worldly media.
                            in traditional system, if you wanna develop skill of being jovial cuz you value it, how would you go ahead
                                    you will pay the price of associating with jovial and funny people and learn nuggets of skills from each one of them and make your own asset.
                                    and let the gradient descent take place.
                                    current day and age that possibility is easier to obtain cuz people have made profession out of it and you can pay the price of being their audience.
                                    this ego or need driven cultivation of worldly skills is far better than targetting the second hand fruits of experiencing emotions.
                                    so the first hand experience is more in alignment with Krishna's plan than second hand experience - although in moderation it can assist evolution.
                                            the pleasure of first hand experience is far more than second hand experience (although excuse - you can have best of world performing for you)
                                            but it takes relatively more price.
                                    The hacking into those emotions like thru chemical substances is strongly discourages and is regarded as sinful. You complete disregard the price of karma.
            Spirituality
                    1 sign of kaliyuga is short memories so don't make statement which create doubt in the minds of people.
                            eg - saying that SP criticized Darwin - which is correct and the rightful guidance to us.
                            but what is intent and what's impact 
                                    intent is incomplete with such statement you may want to qualify with more statements to make a point but those who only listen this have more confusion than before.
                                    so, the solution is reiterate the conclusion and pick a thread quickly finish it off to come back to the same conclusion and move the main thread of conclusions all along.
            Spirituality
                    Sinful is to hacking into the pleasure of that layer
                            Bodily - illicit sex
                            mental - intoxication
                            intellectual - gambling, stealing

                                    festivals - godly and people's like birthday, marriage
                                    procreate
                    10 paap (vs ashubha - inauspicious cuz of disalignment with Krishna)

                                    violence - animals, plants also
                                    hypocrisy - pretension
                                    telling lies
                                    not elderly respects
                                    misconduct - aacharan theek na hona.

                                    selfishness
                                    uncleanliness
                                    destruction or wasting - water, etc.
                    yama, niyam seem to an excellent list to me but does that cover somethings like respecting elders.
                            satya, ahimsa, asteya, brahmacarya, aparigrah; shauch, santosh, tapa, svadhyaya, ishwar pranidhan.
            Spirituality
                    parisar - from all 4 sides; parishram - work from all sides (make it work)
                            no question of proud - no matter what you do, there is road ahead - eg - SP asked waking him up in midnight why you not awake - why not paramhamsa.
                    we so fond of you but you ain't coming - can't say you are hard hearted that's against shastra so maybe our misfortune - at least for yashoda you come.
                            so no time to criticize Krishna.
                            svabhaviki bhakti or baladvita bhakti - feeling of parajaya fear so that's not very favorable.
                            LCM wants to go to Vrindavan - others saying no so he resists - this helps bhakti - teevrata badhati hai.
                    shaking head is not proof of learning but question paper. (iow, tests are proofs of learnings)
                            satyam param dhimahi - discussing among each other during exam - not affected by presence - dadati prati grahnati - helping smaranam of each other.
                    Evaluate quality of love - uncertainty and separation (anishcitata and sang vicched) - future is uncertain and when not connected but still wanna serve that's proof.
                            vraj people were really tested by separation and they do it.
                            celibate life difficult cuz of uncertainty
                            Krishna bhav was if I stay connected to devotees in Vraj then they would be vulnerable cuz of my presence.
                    KC - it is about distributing anand.
                            distributing BG but unhappy - why so - so dhoop ..maybe you will become happy.
                            stay happy is most difficult - Chant HK is simple and lot of sweat over it. That's all HK do.
                    LCM kirtan so happy - people rolling on the ground.
                    hridaya parivartan paying the price to understand devotees of Krishna of Vrindavan, etc - want administration pay price of IAS.
                    LCM tells symptoms of purified - attentive chanting, attentive service, attentive in dealings with devotees - avoid offences.
                            12 offences by ramanujacharya - distinction based on any material aspects enumerated.
                    body is such that association with it for 1 day makes something smell bad - so this machine is not sat-cid-ananda.
            Spirituality - CCP
                    probs with spiritual wisdom - bearable and meaningful
                            we don't hate pain but meaningless pain - the pain of injection is invited rather paid by us.
                            similarly, we want pleasure or humor but meaningful pleasure - comedy day and night, we can't bear
                            scolded for mistakes is accepted but not without feels very bad.
                            pleasure is too cheap a purpose to make life worthwhile. Self esteem grows down - when 7 else doesn't do respect, then get angry.
                            #serious + fun - serious is more important and fun is means - like driving car to destination vs enjoy thru the way vs just visiting restaurants thru the day is the goal.
                    demons are dehumanized - in problematic situations, anyone can do it.
                    experience => sanskar then for rahat you continue doing and cross maryada.
                    weakness vs wickedness - vivek ka nash hona so buddhi subjugated to that - hot head vs cold blooded.
                            Dhritarasha and Duryodhan combo. wicked can seduce weak hearted to below the mountain so be careful.
                            krurata, kapaT-ta, dushta-ta
                    prajalpa association - may increase our dushta-ta also.
                    healthy fear - svastha bhay - sakaratmaka bhay.
                    kaikeyi's weakness converted to wickedness by association - so be careful.
                    shameless is strong word - accept our mistakes and also accept ourselves with the mistake
                            the same level of mistake may keep repeating but not growing so gotta solve that.
                            distance between abstinence and indulgence is different for different people.
                            fail in KC is better than failing outta KC.
                            don't fight the wave for drowning but hold onto the anchor.
                    purpose is pleasure and not getting - don't get happiness? why live (suicide), why others (genocide or homocide)
                            mind undervalues what we have and overvalues what we don't have.
                            to be happy is possible but happier than others is impossible.
                    order and chaos both is required - like order for listening lecture and chaos of new points in lectures.
                            #certainty and uncertainty is both a need.
                            can't understand the world chaos but the transcendental purpose faith must be there.
                            apartments as safe a mother's womb - SB 3rd canto but it's true - order inside there has order amniotic fluid.
                            God is not separate to us - we are related - serve and get back.
                            cause of problem may not be known but purpose of problem is Krishna's grace.
                            chaos in the order bring a better order by Krishna's grace.
                            Prabhupada went from order in India to chaos in foreign to a better order of ISKCON - ei kichu karje taba ei anumane.
                    wahaan karyakram mein bhakta the - bhakta is very elastic word.
                            speaking class is not just delivery but also discovery.
                            disrimination but no judgmental - logon ko neecha dikhana zaruri nahi hai.
                                    parent hai - to kartavya hai. what's anukool hai for my bhakti - no permanent label but practically, labels is necessary - that this person tends to act like that.
                                    mind is conditioned in that way - soul is pure. Only ninda karna is bad for us also. can't elevate other - they elevate themselves and encourage them to do that.
                            enlightenment + encouragement both are reqd - encouragement then I am already good, only enlightenment then seems not pragmatic.
                    maya is not entirely demoniac - shade of grey - architect of demons like vishwakarma for demigods.
                            sita didn't know about Ravan's curse
                            Ravan's strategy to win over her - praise her beauty, brags his wealth, snub his competitors.
                            why ashok vatika - sita wanted to be in jungle kind cuz of husband - mandodari also firm stand - she milded the stance of Ravan.
                            Ravan had 10 heads of advisors and lost all of them one by one. how many people need to die over your lust?
                    Christianity - we are innately sinful and only god's grace can save us from that.
                            Communism thought - poeple are innately good social stucture makes them bad. Society treated them badly - give them better conditions and they will change.
                            people are innately good or bad - it is easier to love humanity than human - thinking specific gives us names - society can change but not this person.
                            there have been people where plastic execution phaansi - purpose is evil. accidental flaws is ok.
                            sadism - where you delights in seeing the suffering of someone.
                            what wrong did I do to you that you behave me like that - we need a world view that acknowledges evil.
                            not e1 save-able by jesus but they are virtuous so there are levels.
                            same bad raising - one rises and one falls - 7 says I will never drink another I drink cuz both had drunkard parents.
                            BG says born in Demoniac birth - refering to not soul but mind - impressions from the past - potential for good but propensity for evil.
                    good without devotional; sightful sensitive even though meat-eater

                            reality and philosophy are complex and putting labels on them is not that easy. reality is not all workers are lazy like capitalists say or so on.
                            humility is to acknowledge the complexity of reality - reducing reality to philosophy may not be best thing to do.

                            offense or prasadam has spectrum of meaning - negative on seeing devotee (thinking their dealings with us than connection with Krishna)
                            unable to tolerate praise of some devotee - SP disciple - devotees can be more wonderful you can imagine and even dreadful.
                            1 lady - how you still smiling - world has so much misery and doesn't need one more miserable person.

            Spirituality
                    4 regs are avoiding excessive and hacks of lower layers for they are bad for your SQ.
                    ?sins or paap is hurting other jivas in some way
                    hacks are also sinful to a certain degree - sin is not 0 or 1 - degree of what's hurting to Krishna.
                    Aparadh is more serious than paap - displeasing to Radha or Devotional service - destroys your tendency to SQ.
                    people do excessive - it of course invites karmic reaction.
                    Meat eating is ego hack -
                            Tendency of "I am superior to you" - people kill people which is excessive version of one on animals.
                            Krishna told Arjuna to insult someone is like killing them - once more proving yourself superior or making someone inferior for the same effect (jealosy vs envy)
                            it is relatively easy to boss over those poor chaps and make them suck.
                            1 insight I got - sometimes people want to experience the superiority in name of religion but that's ok - the problem goes away gradually - na chirat.
                                    another problem is seeking validation for doing the right thing but that's also ok - it will go away
                    it looks like it is theoretically possible to keep yourself miserable
            Spirituality
                    Actual test is entirely your own - what's your fallback when gratification is starved.
                    it is very natural for us to seek gratification - anandmayo abhyasat.
                    the ease of gratification at a layer is dependent on how much investment has been made in the past
                            eg - maths gratification is readily accessible if you have worked it out in the past.
                    that's why investment on spiritual front of life is so important - sweat in peace, bleed less in war.
                            you can experience this in short term and long term 
                            if you had quality chanting for the day - you will not have urge for fallback when things don't go your way.
                            over a long period of time, the fallforward becomes natural and is more readily rewarding 
                            eg little introspection for higher clarity on a situation, chant and quick spiritual gratification
                            this gradual upliftment is preparation for the ultimate exam of death (according to Krishna)
            Spirituality - how everything becomes auspicious
                    we want meaningful pains and meaningful pleasures
                            so everything is auspicious cuz our life's purpose is not blind run for pleasures but seeking purpose behind the realm 
                            and use eth that comes to form the narrative we want (ourselves) and we believe that there is a transcendental narrative also.
            Spirituality
                    Divyadev Pr - I can't tell what I discussed with RSP but I can tell you this - everything is taken care life and also the death. Live for Krishna and also die for Krishna he said.
                            He saw a dream about what's gonna happen to him on bus travel - Krishna told.
                            I didn't know that it was the last time else I would have treated him with more respect.
                            Personal interactions with him - it has been made like an apple pie - you just gotta it the readymade cake. Even it is sized to mouth size
            Spirituality
                    Figure of speech - continuum of expressions - what will X not do? What devs won't do for Krishna? What Y won't say? - nothing!; Also "I like it like that!" for all Krishna's qualities enumerated.
                    Brahmaji attracted to daughter - very subtle anartha we have attraction for our creation.
                    Cloning - dominant recessive, suitable culture, living cell not chemicals; how stuff works is a different layer of abstraction and doesn't matter to us (nor can fully be known)
                            but we surely can relate that there is a self separate from body and mind, etc.

            Spirituality
                    I am at a certain state which grants me a certain degree of satisfaction or happiness - doing it more is just good abhidhyeya for acceleration towards prayojan but won't grant highest promises immediately.
                    So for now, I must depend on lower layers of gratifications and spiritual projections at those layers - pleasure of service at those layers.
                    Question to ask every day is how much did I have pleasure of growth today and how much did I help others grow
                    Question like how much I got to enjoy the pleasure of achievements and helped others achieve (Culture of achievements)
                    Question on culture of fun; culture of sense pleasures; culture of stability or strength.
                    This also attempts to answer if devs can achieve or grow to great heights - My experience says they are good performers and continue to be great performers.
                            Eg - BVT, KKP, Arjuna, etc - the proof is very obvious - spirituality attainment takes more sacrifice, discipline, price, perseverence, etc than other lower layers.
                            But in spite of all these lower stabilities the purpose of all of them remains to not starve the higher layer but assist highest layer with stability.
            Spirituality 
                    Ensemble Learning - Analogy do you consult many people or learnt sources for making decision of going to join engg or not or many people - pappu pass ho gaya.
                            different algo, different training set.
                    Spirituality - Not a great idea that you are being manipulated thru emotions of FDDL - like karvachauth, hell, etc.
                            There is no problem with psychological manipulation as an art - that's a legitimate field of study - problem is when something is done to hurt you and act against you in long run.
                            it may be a little compromise on your "free will" but is not already being influenced by so many random external factors already 
                                    what's wrong is some conscious factor influences it not restricts it but guides it in your favor.
                            Parents do it all the time but every time in your favor and the list goes on with teachers, etc and what not.
                            Even changing html page to delude them into believing in something but that's not ideal - my ideal is face truth as it is not as we like to believe it. 
                                    Of course suggest ideas for better implementations but don't decide it for them thru changing facts because it can have results you didn't foresee.
                    Spirituality - 7 has objection over so many Deep celebration on Diwali in Ayodhya - well, it's good for economy, macroeconomy.
                    Spirituality - Karvachauth fast for wives and husband handles household chores - similarly other fasts for husbands then wife handles household chores - mutually they grow in spirituality and ones efforts helps others cuz they acted like catalyst for the others' penance.
                    Spirituality - yore, alankars for removing obstacles and bring auspiciousness so vaishnava alankars.
                            any fault in someone - don't dharan it (concentrate on it). Any good quality immediate adoption (1 minute manager - respond in 1 minute and for 1 minute)
            Spirituality - Dashahara Lecture
                    Ramayan is abode of the Lord - we can stay there.
                    Ram katha river from mountain of valmiki - purifies the people along to ocean of ram charitra.
                            some bathe yearly, some everyday.
                    Tulasidas - Purification is typically bitter like medicine (jadibuti, aushadhi) but this medicine that purifies our character is sweet.
                    trying to quench soul's needs in material world is thirst can't be quenched in desert by a drop of water.
                    we burn idols of ravan but what about ravan mentality in our heart. Darkness, lust, envy (vali, Kaushalya) - could not bear beauty or power of someone else etc.
                            ravan very smart - did sandhi with vali.
                    e1 doubted vibhishan - ram - I will forgive even ravan, vibhishan is my devotee 
                            first abhishek of vibhishan of lanka - confidence in vanar sena - he already is the king only time is separating.
                            0 budget sena of Vanarsena - no badge, no money, but they were willing to fight for ram.
                    ravan astonished at their suicide mission - our army is narantak, devantak - tumhare paas kya - hamare paas ram hain.
                            vaanar confidence fighting mightiest with sticks, stones - 1K crore army men.
                            frightened at number of zeros - their reciprocation will be proportional to money are being paid but you are not being paid.
                    ram smiling when request from varun dev - cuz if he fulfills when I ask then he becomes the superior - he wants to elicit my anger to give way to establish KC.
                    appeasing for promotions but true report - another ocean after the ocean - ocean of vanar sena
                            ravan asked shuk to get sugriva on his side - siding a human! vanaras beated shuk which asked for ram's favor for dharma - you can't beat messenger like this.
                            ravan was not pot belly guy but very handsome and strong - that's why asked maricha to change.
                            ravan also had abducted ram's mother during her marriage.
                            angad again he is a spy (guptacar) not a messenger why he stayed so long - monkeys again on attack mukke - again asked for help of ram.
                    nal neel civil engineering - only bear monkey's weight and not others; z shaped, limestone for cementing, etc.
                            also some jadibuti inside only your arrows can break the cement nothing else.
                            ram threw stone - your name more powerful than you and you throw and no hope for the stone.
                            ravan not surprised calling it maya power. some monkeys also swam to lanka. 5 days - 14+20+21+22+23 yojans ed.
                            ravan also asked shuk and saran as spy in army - vibhishan identified and again monkeys did their art.
                            angad is vali's son - that's ravan's shiver.
                    nature of anarthas - no counsel from mother, uncle - bad words had any impact.
            Spirituality - All stories are so special - Advaitacharya's prayer was personal. Polity - When a group with common purpose, be it in any layer. See, the purpose is more important than even our individual egos.
                    multiple approaches are possible 
                            counter attack to discourage them but for power hungry, this isn't a friendly approach but may settle the matter then but consistent fights won't help friendship in long run.
                                    let's not fight their game, their rules - but your own game like Peter Baelish said.
                                    Every farmer respects the milking cow and unconditionally favors her. People will favor their interest irrespective of what's right - although right is itself subjective.
                                    here it is not so much about being extrovert or introvert cuz it is about doing the things the best - and constructive discussion can happen over it.
                                    But being social they can do a lot of fuss. That's an advantage but best bet also gets favors from others. Even being good at communications is also an art to cultivate.
                            be expressive or expose the polity - you are discouraging me from contributing. Facial disapproval. Or just this isn't good - but continue cuz higher layer is important.
                                    Eg - Joker movie - ok, I said it because .... but you are making fun of it.
                                    Let it be called boring but this is the ideal stand. This is a stand based on reality and is also politically directing towards regularization of predator's actions.
                                    Or like this is disturbing yaar. Can you tell me what I should do - ask the person in authority.
                            Ignore - sometimes that's the answer.
            Spirituality - on Polity of victimization or taking advantage of 
                    we are not here to ensure that world is free from anarthas, not even that a set of people around us is free from it; we ain't gonna stop lion from attacking an animal.
                            of course, devs give facility of KC evolution but don't decide it for others but facilitate - @horse can be taken to water but can't be forced to drink.
                    many troubles caused due to anarthas in others. From very high layer perspective, all of this will have cessation - nothing will have any significance over a long period.
                    only its abstract or fragrance will remain for some time - only evolution matters thru the situations which truly matters
                    in fact, even we feel busted by material situations because of anarthas - cuz we have hopes and self centered desires with material world - it is all just changes in the states.
                            it is soul that thinks it is worth or reality that identifies with it and hopes grats which is its constitutional position, feels busted cuz of unpredicted outcomes.
                            of course the victim might be hoping for yukta standards of anarthas for sustained growth but it's anartha still.
                                    Won't suggest you choke on yukta standards but should address it positively.
                                    victimization under 7's anarthas is generally a proof of poor EQ or psychological understandings of life.
                                    So, ideal stand is to address the problem head on and try to solve it. 
                                    Even this alignment to EQ to avoid victimization (negative side of FDDL) helps you spiritually thru 
                                            empathy for others
                                            stability for spirituality to grow and evolve in a sustainable way (desirable)
                                            discouraging or regularization of others' anarthas shit from hitting the ceiling.
                            Social studies have psychology at it base and social effects like economics and history are only above it.
                    VA in material world is a great facility to keep anarthas under proper bound and not let it loose. Better still make natural propensities of soul rewarding thru VA - incentivising.
                    Jnanis who want to merge with brahman are done with material works understanding that desires for self centered lust is cause of miseries.
                    Krishna suggests not work but attachment to fruits is cause of bondage - how true that is - the stand that many devs take - if you see Krishna's point of view everything seems perfect.
            Spirituality - Accept that I need grats all the time 
                    that's soul's essential svarupa - sat cit ananda - we are that but forgetting self we tend to crave and look for it which is very natural.
                    this craving is satiated thru science, love and service.
                    VA is also substitute of KC - love and service within the realm but won't give deep satisfaction we crave cuz of objective flaws so ppl need to couple it up with the fruitive work.
            Spirituality
                    Jnanis vs Dhyanis meditation
                            Jnanis meditation is in negation - finding essence behind world like naiti meditations; futility of human body thru corpse burning meditation, etc.
                            Dhyanis are in positive meditation on the transcendental self and superself.
                    Precondition being Freedom from enjoying mentality and doership mentality (sakaam and nishkam respectively)
                            seems like postcondition - soul is eternal enough of nishkam karma yoga already progresses one to jnana yoga - may be in his next life but it does.
                            these conditions are not like 0 and 1 not that you have to be yogi of a kind to practice that discipline but to be able to situate properly in that role it takes some price.
                    I have great appreciation for doing everything and that's great.
                    Yajna is accompanied by its very definition in all yogas - but adherence to scriptural injunctions to carry out karma makes it prescribed.
                    BY is a lot like nepotism - bhai bhatijavad - can meet PM if you know relative who knows 7.
                            Budhi Yoga until Bhakti yoga becomes mature.
                    Arjuna's confusion was settled by Krishna going from nishkam karma yoga what scriptures want me to do to what Krishna wants me to do - KY to BY. That settled it for Arjuna.
            Spirituality - SQ isn't an ego.
                    DS is transcendental to ego cultivation which works in terms of gradient descent.
                    ego is standardization of your attributes and behavior - basically when you become a class in world economics in IQ, etc.
                    SQ is not just about cultivation of yet another ego but more than that.
                    SQ is about changing your realm of existence. 
                            Even within world your being in a company is result of not just 1 ego but multiple 
                            Eg - Job - being a good programmer, but also that place is ok and exciting, your family doesn't have problem with it, etc. Your mental attitude is fine tested by HR - suited to company culture, etc.
                            to change the realm of existence you need a set of ego favorable for that outcome.
                            It is result of Mercy (those who belong there accept you) + Endeavor (Desire (willing to pay the price, value it) + Deserve (have set of egos that favor that)).
                            Is being desirous and deserving sufficient condition - no, just necessary one. If there ain't any vacancy then won't work.
                            In case of SQ what stops mercy - what's best for your given state and what alignment wants anyways - sheer alignment to higher self may not necessarily tread your planned path but whatever is necessary. Can't company ask you to join as intern or serve in another team for 1 month b4 coming joining our team in full blow (that's best for you)!
                    iow, SQ is not attainable by just gradient descent for 1 ego but this on many egos and more, that I have not yet thought about.
            Spirituality - 
                    Free body diagram will make you understand that we bite our own tongue.
                    MOP - high on pleasure but harder the pain when it's denied so MOG being stable for higher pursuit is better approach.
                    Health - when MOG (not exactly) but normalcy with mean towards MOP becomes new normal (cuz it can't be standard normal distribution since we are sat cid ananda and can't settle with limited enjoyment). It is healthy but a little demanding in terms of extrinsic expectations from all the layers - it may act like luke warmth that won't permit best execution of KC? In case of proper spirit of avanti brahmana, it's good. What about others, what about wrong normalcy - so better not wait for hit - be smart but that's natural materialistic choice for growing people - standardize grats.

                    about - this will give a deep sense of fulfillment at that layer and reduced dependence or sensitivity to grats of layers 
                            it's reduced dependence and not reduced engagement. That sets you in MOG instead of MOP which means more instantaneous grats and instantaneous grits.

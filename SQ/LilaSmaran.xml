	<Avatars>
		<Matsya>
			Ref - Vrishabhanu Pr
			Summary - Lord protects vedic knowledge (transmission and from stealing) with apt form thru his devotees.
			Application - Protect vedic knowledge by living it.
			1 day of brahma = 1000 chaturyuga and same for night.
				14 manus in 1 day of Brahma - so can calculate his life also.
				Matsya appeared beginning of svayambhu manvantara and end of chakushusha manvantara again.
					both in crisis time when pralay of the world when the universe is flooded.
					Enthu of Parikshit that no sleep, no eating, etc so eager.
					As per karma and consciousness you get body but why SPOG took such forms like fish.
					Please detail matsya in all the details.
			why he comes
				why he comes - irreligion to on rise and religion in pits.
					why himself, he can send representatives - loving pastimes with his devotees.
						yes has to kill kamsa and all but mainly to interact with Vasudev and Devaki.
						does not send his PA.
					Akbar to Birbal - contemptuous way - Lord comes himself - no answer.
						so made idol of his child and threw in front.
						why you jumped you could ask a representative - that's why Lord comes.
					This pastime to protect vedas.
				Why this form
					He is svarat and free so he appears any time and any where.
					SB - Suka says Krishna telling pastimes being very vast is like seeing moon between branches - shaka chandra nyaya.
						It is bewildering that you unborn take birth.
					He appears among humans but not human, among fish but not fish.
						Devotee recognizes lord in all the shapes - just like dog recognizes master no matter how he is dressed.
			End of day brahma felt sleepy and hayagriva demon stole the vedas.
				why he stole - not answered. Incidentally that's a name of lord's incarnation also.
				Devs and demigods are obedient and asuras are envious or deny existence of Lord.
				Demons are pinpricks to the Lord - doesn't hurt much to Lord but still pain.
				Vedas are how to live life - entirely divine apaurusheya.
				demons are envious of Krishna - want to mislead society to serve their purposes.
					once in a while demons grow in strength - Narad says even I was serving him. But that's rare.
					Ravan made stairs to heaven - enjoy separate from Krishna and knowledge used for that purpose.
				Gross stealing - Vishvamitra once visited Vashishta in hermitage.
					welcomes king and wonderful royal arrangements
					He had kamdhenu cow so arranged for all.
					Even as king I could not do it - but envy came to him. Envy is deadly.
					Vashishta denied the request to give cows - Vishvamitra could not take no for answer so stole it.
					Vashishta Muni uses brahma tejas to defeat on request of kamdhenu.
				Subtle stealing - Similarly this is stealing subtle also.
					computer related crimes - cyber related, information stealing.
					You know processes - 7 can steal the software.
					no patents - he is taking knowledge behind the product - very different kinda stealing.
					govt regs - haldi attempt to be patented.
				You can't hide anything from SPOG.
			He took form of fish.
				kills Hayagriva and returns Vedas to Brahma.
				How much SPOG concerned - preservation of spiritual knowledge - so much contribution of SP.
				Knowledge as good as stolen especially there in west and SP revived so very important.
			Now, 2nd pastime of Matsya - satyavrat King observes fish
				King called satyavrat Muni - some austerity.
				Very austere and once doing worship in a river - offer it back.
				In his palm small fish showed up in his cupped hands - anyone would throw it back in water.
				Then heard a voice from fish - You are protector of e1. Here other aquatics can kill me.
				Jiva Jivasya Jivanam - that's the way of world - bully bullies small bully - big dog wins.
				Here SPOG showing fearful.
				He decides to help the fish - ajnata sukriti - helping Lord without knowing he is SPOG.
				Our ajnata sukriti that we reached SP shelter.
				King thinking that I am the protector - which he is supposed to, in his role.
					Without offering protection, king has no right to taxes.
					SP says vaishnava and brahmins are not supposed to be taxed.
				costliest medicines to child but st doctor not able to help.
			Fish became large - grew so much that could not move in jug.
				kamandalu not enough.
				put in a well - still grew not happy in this residence.
				E1 needs happy residence.
				working and salary - not enough - inflation goes so much that it remains same.
				Our Needs go on increasing with life.
				Take to largest reservoir - available and then to ocean - largest he knew.
				He has been following instructions all this while - tolerating him all the while.
				Not complaining what are you up to - where you started and where are you now.
				800 miles fish - who are you - your activities are astonishing.
				Realized that he was dealing with SPOG himself. (?could be some mystic also)
				Exalted king and chose him for the pastime.
					I followed 4 regs, sadhana and yatras but not revealed - does not reveal at our whim.
					not power of intellect, expert explanations, hearing but one he chooses to reveal to.
					So the king was the chosen person - it can take lifetimes to get there.
			Specific instructions to the king
				all 3 worlds will be enundated in 7 days - board the boat that shows up to you.
				Boat will be tossed about but don't fear.
				Dark ew but effulgence of sages - boat will enable you to travel safely.
				attach vessel to my horn and I will appear.
				After until Brahma's night is over, I will pull the boat all the while telling about me.
			He has to wait for the events to unfold.
				Faced north east direction and meditated on matsya avatar.
				gigantic clouds and incessant rains - oceans swole and moving to land.
				what will happen after ocean starts moving. That's what happens during pralay.
				This was what Indra wanted with samvartaka clouds for vrindavan.
				He saw a boat coming - he took brahmins with him and boarded.
				constantly meditating on Lord and fish showed up with horn and 8 Million miles long SP tells.
				Offers beautiful prayers to fish - so many fruitive activities for suffering - take shelter to save from false shelters.
				Gold purified of dirt when put to pressure situations - you have purified me.
				Guru is representative of Lord.
				How to accept SPOG as SM - accept KC and his instructions in BG and SB.
				until you accept SM you accept Krishna and others.
			On hearing this freedom from sinful reactions - fal shruti.
				I offer obeisance to SPOG pretended fish and delivered vedas to King and others.

		<Kurma>
			By HG Krishna Chaitanya Pr
			Summary - Lord protects thru instructions and arranging when you can't implement.
			Application - Trust God's protection and foundation.
			Pastime in 8th canto - Suka to Parikshit.
				In response to intense eagerness - wisdom exchange on mutual participation.
				It is samvad not satsang program.
				Personal salvation necessary whether parikshit or Arjuna - but questions for entire world society not just their personal self.
				How can son repay the debt for taking birth - so give to others - so carrying legacy is the repayment. So, with spirituality.
			Indra on seeing Durvasa - gave to airavat to offer and he trampled - Durvasa offended. w/o exchange, he took offense.
				Indra didn't notice presence of Brihaspati and it was offense.
				So, things were subtle and reactions for that.
				subtle insults - so reaction. Made demons powerful - these days also.
				Vedas are not partial - anyone who comes gets benefitted.
				Asuras became powerful cuz they served sukracarya nicely.
				Demons for selfishness and reward for oneself
					compare the demigods vs demons - impetus for welfare of others not as strong as impetus for one's selfish interests.
					In such cases, the demons become stronger. Like in current times also.
					Demoniac forces of anarthas are stronger these days.
					Rupa G - welfare for generations - giving a legacy. But no selfish interest here.
					They fulfilled their instruction by writing books (books are basis) - not preaching programs or making temples.
					That's the foundation.
					Duryodhan had to be replaced cuz it's not just about current generations performing selfish interests but also future generations from there.
					So establishing pandavas was important.
					E1 busy seeing their gain, no1 willing to ponder over interest of Krishna, universe, society.
					Real self interest is in Vishnu - Krishna tells Arjuna.
			Kurma appearance setting
				Kurma avatar is giving foundation for what's gonna come.
				Brahma born in ignorance - Kurma purana 15th purana.
				will discuss pastimes, LCM pastimes involving kurma dev, some more deities and prayers.
				Brahmaji on flooding entered Vishnu's body and then sees eth inside and then Brahma brought out - Padmaja.
				Confused then go back to our roots - so goes to shvetadveep and invokes presence of Vishnu but not able to see. Only prayers.
					Even Brahma does not get to see until Lord wants.
					People ask have you seen God - whether they have seen or not - want to figure about you - if you wasted your life.
					SP - have you seen God - what difference will that make to you. If I have eaten, will your hunger be satiated.
					We can see the intention of person by asking the question.
					Jayadvaita - We can show you thru hearing.
						We don't have to depend on 1 sense to seeing.
						You can't remember later on; the person can camouflage, etc.
						It's not very dependable way to observe.
					Physical platform people wanna see. Subtle platform people invoking in their ways.
				Brahma was invoking thru MOG setting and transcendence - modes of not matching.
					SP - was sure that people here in MOP and MOI will not understand - by your grace please make them understand.
					Continuous system of MOG set up and then they would be attracted.
				Diksha is also sanskar and needs to have a certain goodness - even sanskar performance has to have certain level of MOG.
					For practically 3 generations now, the sanskars have been forgotten.
					no garbhadan, no proper vivah, etc.
					Purity of womanhood was test of standard of civilization - Arjuna says that in BG chapter 1.
					SP lectures more relevant to us now cuz we are westernized - our only way is convenience and not science.
					Strong generation is need of hour. What to do with children - should be thought b4 marriage.
					Less marks cuz question papers and wanna write what we know and not what should have studied anyways.
					Science of tradition is lost and then struggle in spirituality for lifetime. cuz no foundation.
					Artha ka bhaya then no necessarily dharma but dharma ka bhaya then artha will naturally come.
					worried about livelihood, then may not care for life.
					SP - survival of fittest - best surviver will never die but you are surviving to eventually die - so immortality is best survival of fittest.
				Nimi knew time and vashishta came - sacrifice was done.
					both cursed each other to die. Started with yajna and in the end no1 survived.
					Nimi's body with priest to get body back - Nimi didn't want cuz that's the goal.
					not angry when cursed to die - cuz conquered anarthas.
			Vishnu is heard but not seen.
				friction - fire from wood, earth then grains and water. Milk from cows.
					Not milk dairy but milk ocean. Amrita - Yudhishthir says milk is nectar.
					After so called independence, man to cow ratio changed from 1:10 to 10:1 lesser.
					Milk drinking for get nectar. Immortal for that.
					It increases one's life - modern man so propagated don't drink milk.
					adulterated poison many places.
					Cows lineage one devotee was maintaining.
					Monkey civilization - that they will work hard for lesser resources.
						Kali yuga that people prefer flesh of slaughtered over the milk of the cow.
						Work hard in industry in frustration - many but not interested in food grains, milk and DS.
					Develop one's brain by drinking milk.
			Vishnu suggests churning of milk ocean - Bali M accepts the proposal from demigods.
				Mandar mountain used but crushed under it. Only trying to do Krishna's will.
				They had to do their best and shortcomings Krishna rectified we gotta do best and Vishnu enters in critical times.
				Vishnu brings their lives back thru glance.
				atyahar or alpa-cesta both are not good.
				deal with one's svabhav and also accept the other person's svabhav also cuz svadharma as per their nature only.
				Vasuki - we want head said Demons but got poison.
			After churning for some time - mandar was sinking and can't hold it.
				Many Lord forms in a go - Vishnu for churning, Kurma, Ajita, Dhanvantari, Mohini Murti.
				so many avatars but first came kurma and for what - strong foundation
				eth in our spirituality needs strong foundation.
				Nectar of bhakti needs foundation.
				Vishnu kept inspiring and MOG is go on without losing hope.
				Significant of stability to foundation of devotee's vows.
				BVT in bhakti bhavan - found deity of kurma and given to BSS for strong foundation for vows.
			Kurma kshetra in andhra - pastimes of deity - protects dev's vows.
				she trying to evade but the king wanted to fulfill his lusty desires - she prayed for mercy to do ekadashi vrata - transported to a mountain.
				Kurma mantra to chant - he chanted for 300 years - collapsed and Narad M requested Vishnu to give darshan.
				wanted to take bath - kunda for the king kurma dev created.
				deity of kurma dev - done by brahma. Done by madhvacarya.
				This was where madhvacarya was transported from Puri.
				saves one from falling to hell.
			Itching sensation of kurma was settled by churning.
				desire for SG, karma, and jnana - is like the itch.
				He can clear that.
				Meditate on breathe of kurma - cleanse our dirt thru his breathe.
				Krishna says be like kurma - when to withdraw and when to active senses.
			LCM visited kurma kshetra and sees a brahmin who was told to read BG although illiterate.
				meal given by 3 pm and LCM said sita can't be touched that was maya sita.
				Kurma purana - madurai LCM confirmed that maya sita was returned during fire test.
				Ramdas Vipra shown the evidence later on from the book.
				Strong foundation for tattva understanding.
				B4 nectar comes poison.
		</Kurma>
		<Varah>
			Varahdev - by HG Chaitanya Charan Pr
			Summary - Transcendental boar to reinstate devotee earth in orbit.
			Application - Lord is concerned with universe when help invoked from a devotee Brahma.
			Does God exist - any portion like Antartika we can try to disprove or prove by travel or imagination but we are talking about the source of whole existence.
				B4 answering a question first we need to understand what's being talked there - Eg is circle circular.
				Parents and where do we stop and point of stopping will be god.
				Source must have consciousness else from where will it come here - material world view is from less comes more vs spiritual world view from more comes less.
				How from disorder order comes is a mystery.
				Science is approaching reality - can't prove or disprove - just misappropriate the power acquired thru science to propagate their world view.
				Now that source can revealed or seen as target of research.
				Same God or AT is perceived or conceptualized in different ways by different traditions.
				Some say infinite and can't be depicted.
				Zoomorphism - ascribe animal form to god vs anthropomorphism - too big so giant lion, too strong, etc.
				House is limited and blown up but still limited - with or without form. limitations is not by form but by matter.
				If we can't see God how can we claim that he is unknowable. He is too big - for that we gotta first see God to tell that he is too big.
				BVT in a book discussion - why depict god in material, why not just think - even thinking is material, so are you suggesting that don't think about him as well.
			Monotheism and Polytheism in western religious studies.
				Krishna in BG and Bible - Letter A in alphabets; I am alpha and beta of everything - same description.
				This map doesn't decide reality but depicts it. Bhakti tradition goes beyond just mono or poly.
				Multi-level Poly-morphic bi-mono-theism.
			Boar is not considered worshippable (rather abhored by ppl) animal at least - purity required for yajna.
				1 muslim devotee - asked in mosque if God's in stool also - read BTG book God is present ew even in stool.
				Atheists think just believe - pray, pray and obey but bhakti is actually analyse, realize and relish.
				All books are QA, process to raise consciousness and then relish the raised consciousness.
				Different religions talk about God but details are unclear - graphic and vivid conception to adore God.
				This form of Lord is non-material and very attractive.
				God beyond matter transcedence and within matter is iminence.
				HN, deity is transcendental - manifesting thru matter but trans to that.
			SB 2nd canto discussion starts and after general talks about God
				Parikshit asks to discuss about forms of God - then all forms in day of brahma with different sections are taken.
				Further divided into manvantaras and God's appearance there.
			Hiranyaksha - eyes of gold but actually eyes on gold in his context.
				Gold for wealth, ornaments and sacred activities.
				dharma not religious rituals but represent order of the universe and we harmonize to them.
				Inauspicious birth - it is like weather forecast; what signs indicate so subtle observations in the world.
					Earthquake b4 some animals behave very differently. We don't understand how they understand.
					Vedic cosmos has different scales - so may seem wrong but observed reality depends on observer in quantum.
			Terrorist and Narad's guidance
				reign of terror and no1 able to fight - itching for fight
				Narad tells why fight with lesser creature, fight with Vishnu he will destroy your pride.
					will provoke him and no more terror.
					demons think possession is ownership. Possessor could be tenant.
			Reaches - Varah floating - come out and fight - oh I can't escape now that challenged but will play for sometime.
				You don't like that then come inside. Mace fight, earth to side and floats outside.
				What keeps its axis - gravity but what creates gravity - it's the mystic potency of the supreme Lord.
				Fight was competition of skill - varah loses maze but waits for him pick again which varah appreciates.
				Please don't play that auspicious moment is going on. Hearing this prayers confirmation that it's Vishnu.
				A form never seen b4 so no connection with Vishnu but must be Vishnu eventually with fight.
				Chakra released which is unstoppable like time. But seeing his will to fight Vishnu stopped.
				Maze fight. Hiranya hit boar and board smiled. No effect so gotta use some other tricks.
				Hits with head and finishes so he was playing all this while
					So God doesn't fight with evil - he is even the source of evil.
			Why God fights and why does he
				Good and evil in world - some think that fight means the 2 fight.
					satan is in control of this world and not god.
					end fight will finish off the satan.
				we go to up is not geographic up - up in USA and India are 180 degrees apart.
					God is cause of all causes but not cause of all effects.
					Vegetation grows cuz rain but don't say rains responsible for weeds.
				If all God had to delight in was e1 coming and worship for eternity then it's boredom.
				all attractiveness come from Krishna but does not take to him.
					maya is to not see Krishna.
			QA -
				different forms for different purposes - scriptures then hayagriva and narsimha for protection; so forth. Does that not limit God by mood?
					Not limiting cuz lord manifesting in particular way for particular reciprocation.
					Krishna can also protect but does not involve in that activity as much as some other form.
					Vrindavan abode of love - no weapons but only playful mood.
					particular mood manifested to intensify a certain emotion in devotee
					so if we start questioning every detail why peacock feather, isn't that bias; why biased to blue color.
					God is person and has likes and moods - motivated by selfless love so different from ours.
					1 praise to Lord that you show the form which devotee is attracted to.
					not limitation but facilitation.
				Jnana Karma anavritam
					covering is the misdirection of consciousness. Like light thru glass of different color.
					capacity of action and cognition are misdirected when contamination - impressions of the world.
					Innate nature of soul to be activated.
					Karma not given up by Arjuna and so with Word.
				Radha Krishna - 1 person in 2 forms - only in lila they appear to be separate.
					angry but for pleasure of Krishna.
					Distinct person - eth in spiritual world is manifest for love.
					Stealing is crime so why butter stealing - for intensification of love he does.
					action without position leads to confusion. Doctor surgery is not killing you gotta know else you will be shocked when paid after his cut.
				Science is moving from visible to invisible principle.
					pashu means pashyati iti pashu - seeing is believing creatures.
					empiricism visible reality; rationalism for reasoning.
					quantum physics - how do I visualize it - shut up and do maths - as long as maths works it's all fine.
					it's contradictory to relativity - one is particle and another is wave.
					Acquiring knowledge - certainty to uncertainty.
					Science is not quest of knowledge but quest for studying the correlation between the observed aspects of knowledge.
					Science is just offering us a map. You don't exist in map so you don't exist - map depicts reality and what doesn't matter is removed.
					Spirituality and science have different focus and so they are not contradictory or aligned - just some details may match or not match cuz different maps.
					spiritual science so experiment on consciousness.
					tech shows control of outer world and is attractive and same thing can be done in inner world.

		<Narsimha>
		Narsimha - By HG Radhika Vallabh Prabhu
			Summary - Narsimha meets all devotee's words by resolving all contradictions placed by Hiranya.
			Application - Lord is above contradictions. Dev's words taken seriously by Lord.
			Partial then we don't like to be with that person.
			doubt expressed and clarify the doubts of so many conditioned souls that it brings them closer to SPOG.
			Eg - BG, SB, etc.
			Shishupal would generally count till 99 but so much envious during rajsuya that it crossed all bounds and just blasphemed without count.
				It's inconceivable - as level of absorption like Gopis love for Krishna.
				Why Krishna so impartial asks Yudhishthir from Narad and not Krishna - devotees know better.
				how could he get the destination that yogis or jnanis get after lives of tapasya. Not fair.
				Freedom fighter quota - getting results which others take effort for.
				Same event - shishupal or hiranya - absorbed in him whether lust, love, envy, affection - same results.
				Material body but not material conception of life - not affected by insults.
					Lord being not beyond dualities is not affected by how he is being treated.
				SP - If we feel discriminated by bodily color then how are you different.
				If unfavorable gets result, what of favorable.
			Prahlad in Shant rasa that Lord is so great.
				Yudhishthir says prahlad so great - does not say that he is shanta but we are sakhya so superior.
				GKDB won't associate with materially associated - SP went to purify them.
					Pandavas were in palace to purify others and get Krishna's association.
			Story starts - Father trying to kill the son is so unheard of.
			Hiranya vs Prahlad's teaching styles
				Speak as per TPC - philosophy and nice stories to understand - great public speaker.
				But hiranya didn't believe in the content he spoke
				lamentation is sign of shudra - lamenting over what's not worthy of grief in BG.
				Spoke about soul - didn't believe in what he spoke - went to tapasya to defeat vishnu.
				Prahlad believed what he spoke inside out.
				Hiranya's message was effective - right message and heard in right attitude did transform the listeners of hiranya.
				Cricket's score whether told literally or poetic - it works.
				Speaker on the other hand was transformed unlike listener - Sanjay to Dhritarashtra.
				State of consciousness of instructor or instructed is what matters.
				Hiranya spoke with right philosophy with wrong purpose.
					St wrong Philosophy for right purpose - eg - bharat Ram milap in the forest
						Jabali says - it's all chemicals and no need to follow father after he is gone.
					?similarly wrong phil wrong purpose and right phil, right purpose.
					truth with bad intention is more destructive. path to hell thru good intentions.
			Hiranya's results and Hiranya's atrocities.
			Vishnu speaks to demigods after they approach.
				Wait till I appear. Once he offends my greatest devotee, I will appear.
				Mad darshanam is translated by SP as DS - DS = seeing Krishna.
				Tidal wave - caused by invisible earthquake under ocean and don't see until they come to coast.
					Like tidal waves sinful reactions are always coming.
					suddenly huge reaction.
			Prahlad getting taught - rooted in Narad Muni's teachings.
				so heard but accepted in heart DS only.
				Education to facilitate consumerism, support industrialisation, separate from family, etc.
				Alternate education system also - we are not helpless.
				emptiness or superficiality was understood by Prahlad cuz rooted in DS.
				Separate from family => consumerism.
			What's the best thing you learnt at school.
				attached to household life - Punah punascharvita charvananam.
					ESMD repeated. But maya powerful - makes it feel extraordinary.
					Same ESMD from different lives, different species, etc - same thing.
					Frequency, Availability, Familiarity - so extraordinarily ordinary.
				But I have not enjoyed ESMD - only possibly if landed from spiritual world.
				no impediments in pleasing Lord - as child or old - cuz relp always exists.
					Like father son - always possible.
					Pleasing lord so simple just in mind.
					Give husband rasgulla thru mind or give wife necklace in mind - does not work.
				Lord is supreme object of affection.
				Bhakti as not selfish - my sadhana for liberation but others happiness as mine and vv.
			Hiranya vs prahlad - opinion styles
				Imposed views on others. Prahlad gave views and let them choose.
			Narsimha used the seat of Hiranya - purify objects to offer to Lord which he st does not accept but here's demons seat.
				didn't offer but some credit by accepting some service - that's Lord nature.
				Devotee may forget his past DS but Lord does not.
			Narad - Lord appeared for devs - Prahlad. Prahlad - for devs means demigods, jaya vijay, etc.
				words of several devs, brahma, 4 kumaras (prediction of birth and killed by Lord)
				Also Narad Muni - to kayadu he had said he is a devotee and protected by Lord.
			QA - But Lord's words that 3 births and then back - so why sayujya mukti - how to reconcile
				Sayujya mukti and then back to Lord from there.
		</Narsimha>
		<Vaman>
		Vamandev - By HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu
			Summary - Lord protects both devotees Bali and Indra in a way that's appropriate for them.
				Does good for world in the process. Demigods favored cuz it's planned so.
			Application - Lord's will is above all moralities and securities even in its worth.
			In all ceremonies one should recite Vaman pastime - mentioned in SB.
				Freed from all sinful reactions.
				?while Vamandev interrupted the execution of yajna but that's original yajna.
			SB Section of Vamandev
				Mahaprakash cuz enunciated glories of devs.
					showcased the glory of lord and relationship between the two.
					If not love for Krishna - then not done properly.
				SB is bottomless, shoreless ocean of nectar.
					9 chapters dedicated in SB - can't talk about Lord Vaman without Bali and vv and so on.
					I will make Vaman effort to share some thoughts.
				Discussion starts - why owner of world had to beg from Bali.
					And after taking he captured and arrested him - that doesn't seem to be good behavior.
					You will appreciate if one has seeking nature like this.
					Person who asks, who answers and who listens, e1 is benefitted.
					Like BG, SB - after audience also benefits.
			Bali still in battle - grandson of prahlad.
				Sukracharya thru mrityu sanjeevani vidya was revived.
				Following scriptural injunction to gain power.
				He also had desire to be largest controller - e1 in lineage had - prahlad got automatically.
				Yajna results - ornaments and dress - Prahlad offered him respects thru garland.
				Going to Indrapuri to defeat. Indra looking at him - it's impossible to fight.
			Indra consults Brihaspati - serving brahmin so well so brahma tej and no1 can do anything - run from back door.
				SP begging to fulfill desire of BSS. Piercing ignorance thru his words - that's empowerment.
					Same words with energy we may say but no effect.
				Dualities - heat cold by body, happiness distress by mind, honor dishonor by intel or ego, victory defeat.
					SPOG is neutral but externally appears to favor. So, Kashyap trans platform but should favor both Daityas and Adityas.
			Aditi told by Kashyap to please SPOG thru milk for 12 days
				Kaliyug must have tried 12 days milk - we want short cut everywhere.
				Read SP purport b4 trying - different realm, times, rules, etc.
				Krishna is generator and parampara is electrical flow - plug point is given as per need not 100K volts but as much needed.
					as per nature you act - heater heats and cooler cools but serves.
					Manu samhita foolish ppl may try to burn that what's this VA.
				so accept as per TPC - shlokas take us to clouds and purports keep us to ground.
			Krishna as Vishnu showed up and serve Kashyap I will show up as upendra - younger brother of Indra.
				Eventually took appearance thru both their hearts and after darshan became dwarf - but extremely beautiful.
				Smile Glancing upon e1.
				His birthday, upanayan, etc all done on the same day.
				Gifts from e1 - Aditi loincloth, heaven umbrella, kamandalu brahma, etc.
					kuvera pot and durga first alms.
				avatars take time - time b4 coming to crux.
				Narsimha dev no baal lila; only baal ki khaal.
				He goes to his main lila likewise.
				He is father of e1 but has father.
					Krishna is like that - eth in his belly but has his belly bound.
			Bali M stands up seeing Brahmin - washes his feet, sprinkles on his head.
				vishnu padi ganga and shiva on his head is mahajan.
				Likewise, his footwash shows he is on the way to being mahajan.
			Donation
				Those who go for donation, learn from him - the best beggar when it comes to that.
					Krishna as devotee means best devotee LCM.
					Krishna in seductive woman - mohini the best.
				Glorify the donor and his dynasty.
					puffed and then they never to give and if I ask you will surely give.
					For you it's nothing, give this much.
				Hiranyaksha ancestor - challenged the universe that was his power.
					Varah had to really fight to kill.
					After fight he said it was good fight.
					Hiranyaksha - controller universe and SPOG had to struggle a lot.
					Prahlad greatest devotee. Virochan - would give anything Brahmins asked.
				You will give whatever I ask - but I want only 2-3 steps not yours but mine.
					Bali didn't know laugh or cry - asking 10 paisa to millionaires - I own the universe and you want place to sit.
					In Mumbai it can be costly.
					If a person not satisfied with what he has - after obtaining any amount of facilities wealth you will remain dissatisfied cuz of your mind.
				Vedic culture is actually (central idea) to keep eth pure.
					Cleaning ingredient is different for different items - won't use detergent for washing phone.
					For teeth is different, not for hair - I don't know I hope.
					In our life, somethings purified by time - early morning stools but time purifies it all.
					Body thru not just fragrance but bathe.
					Birth purified - illiterate of shudra - sankars.
					senses purified by tapasya. 3 monkeys of gandhi.
					Things by offering to Lord.
					Wealth - clean notes but sinful actions to earn, spend, maintaining inevitably - charity.
					Soul contaminated by designations - jiver svarupa hoye Krishnera nitya das - satisfied.
					Mind purified thru satisfaction - mind distrubed by anarthas like lake agitated by shaking - lust, greed, etc.
					Some say satisfaction so no growth in India - struggle and endeavor.
						#Like opposition ensure govt is at its best, likewise such questions ensure that our KC is right at all projections.
			Shukracharya objects that he is Vishnu don't fulfill
				Smart and practical - you won't be able to give 3rd step and will go to hell.
				You have not chanting om so I have loophole to not give.
				Beta, Give charity but not so much that you become beggar.
				Money into 5 - charity, fame, dharma, security, family.
				He gives systematic logic and reasoning.
				There are 3 kinds of nitis - Brihaspati, Shukra, Kanika Niti.
					Good end Good means - Brihaspati - eg Yudhishthir.
						ppl may take for granted and twist you and take advantage.
						Shakuni he was against him - kanika niti - any costs, any means for self.
					Good end and Any means - Shukra.
						Krishna also followed these in MB.
						Krishna says - Ahi mushika nyaya - Snake and mouse in a basket
							snake could kill mouse for lunch and be 7's lunch later.
							but thought if mouse can drill a hole then both will out, striked a deal.
							Hole drilled and then ate the mouse and went out.
							Krishna told this to demigods to do with demons.
							Hey not right - but he didn't ask to do it et.
						Lord used Shukra niti ew.
							Eg - Narsimhadev also. Nar bhi nahi, simha bhi nahi.
							But uses this when necessary.
							But power of Lord is enemies are also benefitted like friends; that we can't do.
							He does this but is all good.
						Mothers use shukra niti.
							Sugar ball laddu eat it but it has bitter pill inside.
							You cheated but you ate it for your good health.
						We unfortuantely would use it for everytime outta habit.
					Kanika - Any end any means but for self.
						Eg - Shakuni.
						Imagine 7 comes and slaps hey not you, you are devotee you keep on having but don't retaliate.
						I will slap cuz I am nirlajj - Yudhishthir and Gandhi follows these but Krishna said ye nahi chalega yahaan.
				Imagine donation given and then beg for 10 Rs for Idli.
			Bali M - Dharma sankat - Bali situation evaluation.
				on one hand person is made you alive and brought you to what glorious person you are.
				Brahmin asking for charity - promised but half promise. But shukra telling that shastra based I will tell how to escape.
				Dharma sankat on Bali - he closes his eyes on contemplation.
				stimulus and response but thirsty, praise and response.
				A small gap in between is human form of life how to use human form of life.
				This was the point that makes Bali Mahajan.
				Provoking situation - cost is very high - eth you have will be gone and with other side, eth remains as it is.
				Controller to becoming a slave all at once - what a pressure to take decision.
				Consequences very high - that makes decision making difficulty.
				My dharma sankat is end time and gotta finish the story and yours that gotta go prasadam but he must have had already.
				Every choice has consequence you have to take risk.
				You become slave for rest of life vs integrity that I have given word.
				If Vishnu, then that's goal of life - even if you didn't ask I would give eth.
				opportunity of surrendering life - I am gonna give.
			Shukra very angry and curses you lose eth and go to hell.
				walks away. Vaman grows unlimited - in drama we do a little how much.
				1 feet lower planets and another till edge of universe and garbodhak ocean pours from there - ganga.
				So, ganga is charanamrita and the source.
				Demons angry and attack the brahmin - vishnudutas kill them easily but demons stopped by Bali.
				Garuda tied him with rope being a slave now.
					with tears in eyes he says his life is perfect; real mercy.
					desire to lord is over is purified by you.
				Now ready to bear whatever comes he says.
			Lord says - although bereft of riches, defeated and arrested by enemies, suffering and rebuked by SM.
				bound and tied - didn't give up truthfulness, religious principles although I pretended.
				I was just testing you and you are successful.
				If we are fried in oil like prahlad or surrender forced like bali.
				Extreme sincere with weakness - want to surrender and cleanse.
				Lord says when I clean I will do mahaclean - then he does - no, not this much.
			When prayers of prahlad and internal support and good wishes of Lord
				hammer and iron plate with hot iron inside it could take it to be mouled.
				Why only devotees undergo troubles - prahlad M, pandavas, etc.
				Answer was given - 2 purposes - purify and glorify
				Gold has small impurity and put to a situation to make better.
				Like walking with crutches and suddenly removed and you realize you can walk.
				He could also rebel - hell with you. This is what I had to see for you.
				You have given little sample.
				Krishna aways things that are inauspicious - those who have ability to use in Krishna's service.
				He does not give away from anyone.
			Sutala Loka
				Yes, Shukra said it right you will go to Sutala loka but same architect has made it better than heaven.
				Next manvantara you will be Indra - No don't want - you wanted right you said, now you must.
				Krishna will give what you originally wanted - why you came to temple - he will purify but still give.
				I will be doorkeeper for that time.
				You will be aloof from demoniac association.
			Shukra had KK mentality and asked by Vaman what was mistake of Bali.
				Shukra purified - where your HN is chanted, eth is purified.
				This is exactly what LCM has come to give - yajna of Hare Krishna sankirtan.
				Devs come together and dance, all inauspciousness is gone.
				Where the look is auspicious and heavens on their raising hands.
				Each of your associate, O LCM, can purify the universe.
				See Lord satisfied all the parties - lots of orchestration but ultiately e1 is happy.

		<Parashuram>
		Ref - By HG CCP
		Summary - Parshuram observes kshatriya irresponsibility thru personal experience and decides to free earth's burden.
		Application - Lord cares VA. Don't offend devotees.
		Parshuram
			10 avatars in garuda puran.
				not distinctive mention in SB.
				significant incarnations of lord - immoralized by dashavatara stotra.
				gita govinda became bestseller at that time.
				preface to gita govinda is dashavatara stotra - to remind the intimate pastimes is the same person.
				Laghu Bhagavatamriti by Jiva - all lord pastimes.
				Avatar translation as incarnation - idea of Jesus originally.
				Words are handles for concepts - not unfamiliar words for unfamiliar conceptions so SP uses the same word.
				University is important but means to gain knowledge if you are truly interested in God then take it fromt there.
					and increase devotion to God.
					That way Vedic literature is non-sectarian in message.
				So much spiritual richness - so many ways to connect with Krishna.
				avatarati iti avatar is vedic understanding.
					Krishna is beyond realm of time - manifests to give glimse into spiritual realm.
					avatar is 1 person many personalities.
				6th avatar in 9th canto - progressively but not sequentially SB gives.
				Krishna is given in 10th as culmination - gives it in 1st canto but focus on 10th.
				It is preparation for that all this while - why? cuz his pastimes are so human that can mistake him to be another person.
				Eth in SB by Suka is like historian and telling his own autobiography how he got attracted to Krishna from impersonalism.
			Many lilavatars manifest and may also give the yuga dharma - Krishna comes at the end so why would he give the process for yuga in the end.
				spiritual instructions are given - like Ram also.
				Just for pastimes - then lilavatars.
				Krishna gives BG and Uddhav Gita. Ram also gives philsophy.
				LCM is both lilavatars and yugavtars.
				Purush, Guna, Manvantara - for law and order.
				Shakti and Avesh - Shakti when Lord comes to showcase a potency. Avesh when Jiva is empowered.
				We don't just worship sb to feel good but strong philosophical foundation for what we do.
				#Same must apply to other lilavatars as well - strong reason of their manifest with all its details and need for worship given the details.
			Generally scriptures gives some context to incarnation - worldly or his own.
				Sacrifice for wife and mother in law - so fruits exchanged.
				You exchanged so one who was meant to be brahmin son would take birth in kshatriya family and vv.
				So, Vishvamitra and Parshuram - Brahmin who acts as Kshatriya and vv.
				Ok let's postpone the problem - not your son but your son's son will be kshatriya in brahmin's dress.
				So, Jamadagni and then Parashuram - attracted to weapons and without practice he was so good.
				Nigraham kim karishyati - tried to avoid weapons but can't stop what must.
			Pastimes - literal that sound vibration every letter can purify.
				Moral lessons what to and what not.
					Eg - Arjuna is weak minded or soft hearted.
					Beyond judgement but can learn from them.
					1st chapter is Arjuna's qualification for BG.
				Metaphorical - acharyas rarely use.
					symbolism in the pastimes - asuras represent demons.
					SP - never at expense of literal.
					Indians against violence so they try to explain away violence with metaphorical explanation.
					SP also uses it in some books but mindfully.
			Glory of antagonist is also emphasized.
				Krantiveer Arjuan so powerful played with 1K arms and blocked river - river flooded.
				Defeated like animal Ravan. Released neglectfully.
				Ramayan does not tell this pastime cuz every scripture has a narrative or purpose.
				I am best so deserve the best.
				Jamadagni gifted feast to Krantiveer Arjuna using Kamdhenu cow.
				Instead of thinking grateful he thought of stealing the cow in selfishness.
				I want this cow he said cuz best of cows.
				Another similar pastime in Ramayan where Vishvamitra or Kaushik as king earlier goes to Valmiki ashram.
					cow produced soldiers and defeated Kaushik king.
				Didn't bother to ask or give permission and started taking the cow.
			Brahmins those days were very powerful - just be curse.
				Pandavas in garb of Brahmins - Are brahmins allowed to play in this match - shot the arrow.
				Kshatriyas were incensed - demonstrate my glory or 7 in my group should win.
				Duryodhan's extended false ego not easy to understand - when Ashvatthama killed sons - our dynasty has been killed - dude what have you been doing all this while.
				How dare brahmin take away our queen. Bhima gonna rip the tree so didn't do - maze used.
				Arjuna defeating karna - you can't be brahmin such dexterity.
				So intoxicated by his own power - brahmins use power only in emergency.
				Eg - Vena so powerful but brhamins hunkar was enough.
				He didn't use it for selfish purpose and allow cow to be taken.
				7 with kshatriya tendency is itching for fight - when parashuram came back, blazed with fire.
				Fierce battle against fierce personality 17 akshahaunis (18 in Kurukshetra)
				Fight at speed of mind, when tired, then speed of wind.
				Saw army destroyed and then cut off his arms, then head - reduced to helplessness b4 killing - so pride also crushed.
			Jamadagni's response
				Brahmins are Bhudevas - Demigod realm but live on earth.
					Kshatriyas nardevas - earthly realm but as good as god on earth.
					Administer God's will thru shaastra and Kshatriyas administer God's will thru shastra.
				Jamadagni's character shows up - he was bhudeva - representative of god on earth so should not have killed him.
					Ornament of brahmins is forgiveness but since you didn't do that so perform atonement.
					Go to pilgrimage and meditate on god and purify yourself.
				Forgiveness vs trust - forgive someone does not mean trust them.
					Duryodhan - banished vidura to forest. Should have abondoned at birth.
					that one son has now spoilt all the 100 sons.
					Dhritarashtra - intel but becomes foolishness cuz of attachment.
					He st behaves intel. Akrura also once advised - thanks for your words they are like sparks on light in dark night.
					My wellwisher why I sent him away. Next day Dhritarashtra thought.
					Vidura forgives Dhritarashtra but never trust him - always keeps an eye - even for varanavarta.
					Forgive is for past (karma instrument) and trust is for future.
					Kali grows then MOP and MOI increases - unpredictability behaviors increases.
						1 blasphemous person against SP - he calmly heard and then the guy went out
						Devs who felt offended were waiting for signal but none came - why not SP? cuz Krishna allowed that.
						self mastery MOG can act in deterministic ways but others will do as per mind waves.
					Inner resentment - if we hold, then we blow out or blow in - anger or world is bad, I am so victimized.
						Forgivenss opens a third way blow up or in avoided.
						Forgive that not hold that person responsible - don't want this to happen again.
						My karma but you will hurt yourself more by doing this wrong thing.
						If that person reforms then we can forgive and forget.
					Vibhishan vs Vidura
						Vibhishan left Ravan direct evil person.
						Vidura didn't leave Dhritarashtra cuz he was not evil. He was attached to evil person Duryodhan.
						If I go on side of pandavas (although wanted), then direct part of death of kauravas then vidura will never hear from me.
							cuz will consider me responsible for death of his sons.
						Vidura's instructions worked on Dhritarashtra.
						St a person may not reform
							Kamsa shown Devi form was his greatest shock cuz he worshipped Shiva and his consort is Devi.
							So I tortured the Devi - begs forgiveness from Vasudev and he forgives but doesn't trust and tell son is in Gokula.
						No reformation then needs to be punished.
							Eg - Ram gave many chances to Ravan.
							All shanti dutas were attempted to be arrested but backfired with insult et.
							insolent tried et.
						Perform last rites of Ravan - so evil person, he tormented and atrocities to e1 - I can't.
							Ram - soul is always pure. Sinfulness is destroyed with body.
					Conclusion - 3 approaches
						Forgive and Forget - If rectifies.
						Forgive but don't trust - neutral level.
						Forgive and punish - if no rectification.
					4 VA - are 4 human types.
						Where is that shloka - brahmin does immediately.
						Oh universe of shlokas where to find - different varna then burden.
						Raise funds - chant and be happy why make temples.
						VA ensure that while in world eb faces probs but VA ensures to face problems of your choice or liking.
						Earn money, likes to get things done, like to study shastra - efficient division of human labor.
			Revenge by Krantiveer Arjuna's sons
				Infuriated but didn't dare to face Parashuram so deviously killed Jamadagni while offering oblations from behind.
				Mother called Ram Ram - here he hears but not Sita's voice in Ramayan
					lila should develop.
					Ram could also scram like Rakshas - voice not as loud so they won't be able to hear so must run back - had come miles.
					But he is SPOG - not in pastimes. Depends on rasa to relish.
					He could boil ocean by glance which no1 can but mood.
				They scared that in rush of revenge they had done something brutal so in big trouble.
					fled from there - heartbroken 21 times bet her chest - I will kill 21 generations of kings form earth.
				He started attacking the kings.
			Back Story
				Parashuram revives the Jamadagni thru some sacrifice and later becomes saptarishi.
				How could Jamadagni allow to be killed - so simply.
				go get water he once said - momentary attraction to gandharva and lost track of time.
				Timing is important like Ambarish M to get benefit.
				So controlled Jamadagni but so angry that late and unloyal - son told to kill.
				Killing lady is unthinkable in Vedic times - what of mother.
				Kamsa about to kill - such reprihensible act don't do it.
				Angry response is generally anger and leads to disaster.
				Other brothers chastised that wife is disloyal and sons are disobedient.
				Parashuram thought fast - Jamadagni could kill himself so he must be checking obedience here.
				Parashuram killed all of them. Very ghastly.
				Ask for blessing - grant their lives but wipe this memory.
				Felt like coming back from sleep.
				Fault was tiny - Great offense to kill sb over small mistake.
					#disproportionate reaction or response is a sin
					That's why Jamadagni was later killed. Otherwise it would not have worked that way.
				She was largely obedient and chaste wife so Jamadagni had committed an offense against his wife.
				Surprisingly same Jamadagni taught forgiveness when Krantiveer Arjuna attacked but didn't control his anger with wife till extent of killing family members.
					first MMN are very unpredictabile; can't underestimate them.
					Danger at every step; st danger but don't take a step.
					Unfortunate in relationship - far off person then easy to forgive but close person then expectation rises.
						that person does wrong then untolerable anger.
						closer the person is the more sensitive and mature we need to be
						we take them for granted, even small lapses are magnified and lead to ruining of relationships.
					Just like he gave disproportionate response, he got the same thing.
			Parashuram kills kshatriyas generation after generation.
				Many of them fled outside of aryavrat; in other parts like Europe and Asia, etc.
				Socrate, Plato, Aristotle Philosophy very Indian like how?
				SP explains that they were older versions of NRI - moved out from India.
				That's how westernism started. SP in one class said all of a sudden - all of you are descendents of those who fled India outta fear of Parashuram.
				SP mercy that they now come and worship parashuram.
				Aryavrat was dharma bhumi and ruling kingdom - all kings under him.
				Kings and Local cultures with varying degrees of harmony with vedic culture.
				After Kurukshetra battle and weakening force at Hastinapur, Now Delhi, different cultures became separated in India.
				Different cultures and tradition we have but at heart, they are similar cuz same origin.
				sb killed father - so killed all kshatriyas - isn't this disproportionate?
				History - Bhrigu race - Krantiveer Arjuna and predecessors were committing many atrocities.
					standard of kingdom judged not by GDP, loan, deficit, inflation, etc - these are symptoms.
					Actual is foundations - cows, Brahmins, women, children, elderly.
					Attack them is greatest misbehavior.
						Doing duty - Level 1.
						Neglecting Duty - Level 2.
						Going against duty - Level 3.
						Eg - Doctor favors IPL over patient is level 2 but gives poison that's greater crime.
						Eg - Kings should protect brahmins. But killing brahmins like killing patient by doctor.
						Very serious violation of duty - this reflective of neglect of duty and violating codes of conduct (rights of others in current terms)
					That's what was required - not outta MMN - trigger was there but had background to it.
						they needed to be punished.
			He still thought what I did was not proper so atone.
				Gave whole world is charity and Yajna
				Threw axe in water and mahendra parvat showed up - he is one of chiranjeevs.
				Ashvatthama, Vyas, Vibhishan, Kripa, Hanuman, etc.
				He retired and kept nth for himself - no1 can accuse him cuz he kept nth with himself - gave away eth in charity.
				He exhibits qualities as per TPC - Brahmin or Kshatriyas.
				For all future generation, Parashuram becomes a standard of strength.
			Ramayan reference Parashuram - broke bow of Shiva.
				Sita paid obeissance on seeing him - he blessed saubhagyavati bhava.
				Ram I wanna fight with you - But you are gonna fight with my husband and you just blessed me.
				Ok you have broken bow of Lord Shiva - I want to see how powerful you are - try this Vishnu bow.
				More powerful - strung against Parashuram - his power disappeared so he realized it's me only.
			MB reference - Drona reaches Parashuram who was giving charity.
				Eth finished but since you came - weapon or body - take anything.
				Gimme weapons and knowledge of yours and weapons on how to use.
				Teacher of karna and also Bhishma. Cursed Karna also.
				Bhishma tells Amba in last life - so not against him I will lift weapon.
				Amba didn't want to marry him and then older prince she interested also - so thought bhishma was problem.
				Amba doing tapasya and told story and grandfather observed and told Parashuram.
				Parashuram - long renounced weapons so approached Bhishma - marry Amba.
				As preceptor plz help me follow it and not violate it.
				Kumaras told by Brahma - your sons, grandsons, great grandsons - they said nth great about it.
				It's ok to disobey such matters.
				Either accept my order or fight - ok fight.
				28 days fight - commanders in army and just brahmin - first get chariot - earth my chariot.
				wall of arrows coming - plz don't kill my son he is your disciple - not acting like disciple.
				Lot of observers from either side - cheers from both sides and different times.
				1 arrow from Parashuram just pierced Bhishma's kavach and threw him behind.
				Unconscious and then 8 vasus showed up and said keep fighting and you will win.
				No way to win - memory of Parshva weapon from last life not known to him - chiranjeev so he will live but will be unconscious.
				Demigods said don't use that weapon; Narad M generally sets fights for Lord's service but here he stopped.
				He is ascetic, Brahmin and your teacher - don't kill him.
				Again obeissance that I have done duty of obligation you asked me and now free me.
				Parashuram said nth I can do - Amba said ok. Proud of Bhishma Parashuram said.
				All glories standardized wrt to Parashuram.
				LCM - gonna kill outliers like Parashuram - but then gotta kill e1 Nitai said.
					So he comes as HN to kill asuric tendency in heart.

			By Navin Neerad Pr
			Summary - Events are arranged that cause Ram to free earth of demons involving personal stakes.
			Application - Life remains a game of duality but align with dharma (apara and para).
				Opportunities are everywhere (sages in forest, demon killing in exile, learning, etc)
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6j0sPbaH_M
			Ram - e1 knows him. Ideal King, husband, human, etc.
				I worked so hard for being king but gotta leave - will do.
				great sense of duty and sacrifice.
			All types of living entities engaged in service - monkey, vulture, bears.
				So, has SP engaged all of us.
				where's evolution - still on the platform of monkeys.
			Sita chatity.
			Lakshman - mood of protector - not sleeping, not budging, keeping Sita Ram safe.
			Hanuman - liked by all - surrender to mission of Ram.
			All devotees preach by eg to our life.
			Ram showed Should not discriminate.
				dust into the ocean - get out of the way - don't wanna step on you. Both doing important service.
			Equal when Vibhishan surrendered - if say I am yours, I will protect.
				Lanka is yours. Ravan will be given Ayodhya. Bharat will be given Vaikuntha.
				history for us to make right choice unlike Ravan.
			Like Sugriva we st forget our mission - reminded of our mission.
				We are inspired by classes and engagements but go out and forget so remind ourselves every 3 weeks.
			SP wrote books so we would really know - folklore ain't enough; not authentic as per parampara system.
				left to imagination and 4 defects is not right way.
				books are containers - seeds. Seeds not allowed in immigration - may affect our lifestock, ideology, etc.
				Ideas are so powerful - I will go to temple tomorrow you said yesterday.
				Ads do that all the time - better it is done by the books - origin of species by Darwin.
				Books transform the world - why things cost so much.
					Capitalism presented and Started believing it and here we are - it's ew.
					Kerela got communism how thru pamplets and books - it has impact.
				Bible, LCM found Brahma Samhita - so effective.
				Prints and circulated across the world.
				Books access to higher education.
				Even Krishna went to learn. Every media is based on books - even drama or movies.
				Every night 6 pages written by SP for 11 years - not easy - what a sacrifice by SP.
			We have evolution of consciousness even in avatars.
				KC is spiritual communism - positive principles of all ideologies in here.
			Sampradaya means to give. Brahma holding in his hand books in parampara.
				madhvacarya - 81 commentaries on SB.
				Gs marked the words and information expanded on for all people - DS.
				over 100 books, poetry, etc - originals in Kolkata; excavated and etiquettes as well.
				BVT - wrote books and 1 Re each for temple in mayapur yogapeeth.
				He was magistrate - highest Indian.
				BSS - ed newspapers on spirituality.
				SP - dedicated life to SB, etc.
			I am volunteer for ISKCON and people think perhaps I can do it also.
				I felt so good - doing sth without getting paid.
				Give people service opportunities.
				Ram engaged e1 to get Sita - that's what SP is doing for all of us to engage in the mission.
				Madhyama - befriend innocent - how - give them books or share - they see and say HK - as if asking do you have sth for me.
				Take this book and can give donation if you want - what will you do with it - st funny that we will buy guns it's a dangerous world.
					eliminate ignorance world thru knowledge - I can relate as prof.
				We distributed 10 M but bible 60M so lots of scope of improvement.
				Books on table - bible - anyone comes and my gift to you.
				Kirtan and accompanied - books go away.
				People are bored in airport and person comes and offers book - they accept.
					HK I am Navin from Switzerland - from ISKCON showing to nice people; are you nice people - I thought so - you can contribute sth.
					Material world is boring - same ads, politics, sports, etc. But Krishna is exciting - go out and see the magic.
				Use vocal capacity and many say just cuz you made an attempt I will buy.
					I go to temple - today is your lucky day; temple has come to you.
				1 person gifted BG and angrily he returned and said why you told me about it so late - 3 years to read and convince myself.
				Greatest gift to give to sb.
				Krishna shakti vina na hi parivartan.
				Hanuman flew but not we will come back to you - that's passion for mission.
				7 said left as teenager to Canada from Germany - you left at teen this guy left in 70s on order of SM - thank you, you made my day.
					Thank you SP you made my life.
			Like making bridge e1 contributes to help SP - please SM.
				Perfection of life is serving mood of guru - sharing spirit of message of KC. Team effort is required.
				Foundation of sankirtan and things become stronger.
				Sankirtan absorption and lost - time and space - snana in ganga.
				give yourself luxury of reading SP books ed.
				The day when SP book not read is the day wasted - keep reminders.
				read even 1 verse but read for sure.
				Yes yes I read it; tomorrow I will - ideologies will have effect on me - galvanize ourselves.
				Those who distribute read.
				SP words spoken and other say it's revolutionary - nth as pure as trans knowledge.
				Spiritual leadership - many ideas and spiritual entrepreneurship comes.
				People take books and take a look at us - don't match then they return.
			Positive stress - normal distribution
				If stimulated too little, then little performance - bored, apathetic, underwhelmed.
				stimulated just right, best performance.
				If stimulated too much, then reduce performance - anxiety, burnt out, overwhelmed.
				Why people on wall and take selfies - people are bored and need to do sth.
			QA or reflections
				Buy SB cuz when person looks at you asking for books, you don't wanna look stupid.
				Chant HK and share HK - we are not selfish. Wanna share.
				book a day, keeps maya a day - keep a book in pocket.
				Vision of world - I like I don't like like FB but share books and different outlook.
				Make teams and share KC. Read SB in groups - 41 pages a day - 2hr a day - 2 years to finish.
				Ram lived the mission and feels so special - so should we - mission of BD.
				No not me I am atheist - My name is Arjuna - Arjuna was atheist in beginning it's ok ; you will like it.
			QA - 4 shlokas - seeds of knowledge and Brahma is full of knowledge.
				How to distribute - keep the books, they will find their ways.
				SP also had mission like Ram and that's what makes them special. Mission is demanding but that's the price.
				Pay the price - SP said I have the disease that I can't think small.
				We want wisdom realized knowledge and that's what keep movement alive - the realized stuffs.
				Put words in them - Yes you can do that - chant HK b4 sleep and read 1 shloka of BG.
					I will have to disappoint you - there will be bombs, plane crashes, accidents, cancer etc
					good you have books deities and knowledge - ancestors legacy received and share with others to cherish it more.
					spread the gifts you have received from your ancestors and beautiful tradition - charity starts at home.

			Balram - by Adi Keshav Pr
			Summary - Lord's brother serves pastimes. Has all the power.
			Application - serve Lord's pastimes not your own.
			Krishna is one with balram but why expanded - svamsha - same activities that can be done.
			Vibhinnamsha - don't have same potency - increase loving exchange is purpose.
			Seva bhagavan and sevya bhagavan - color difference - white and bluish black.
			Can't fathom Lord's nature completely - in that brahmand - Sheshnag.
			Srishti lila important but done by Balaram and rasas relished by Krishna.
			Gravitational force comes from balram.
			Anant cuz anant pastimes, qualities and glorifying Lord in ananta way.
			In personal form - serves personal form - all paraphernalia to serve is balram.
			Who does it - guru - so Balram is guru tattva - 24 hr engage in service.
			So adi guru.
			Ramayan full of tragedies - Lakshman with Ram - Don't have to come - I will always be there.
			Services - remove weeks, pebbles, etc. Chopping woods, making hut and beds - never slept always serving.
			He came as elder brother - cuz problems as younger brother in treta.
			Did eth Ram said - banish Sita - gotta do.
			He serves in 5 rasas - all of them.
				Serving Krishna.
				Sakha - wrestle and dance.
				Elder brother so take care so anxiety - vatsalya.
				Madhurya - Ananga Manjiri elder sister of Radha.
				Anant meditation.
			Krishna is stronger cuz Balram leans on Krishna in Vrindavan deity.
				not different from Gaura Nitai so important to identify them.
				Dispute among disciples - yamuna prabhu - Is color the only difference OR enjoys with Radha - both are true.
				Sacred vows with husband wife but not with brothers - Lakshman never left Ram - always serving.
			As Balram - moved to different womb of Rohini.
				Human like experiences and pastimes.
				butter stealing. 5 year old - take calves with them.
				Everyday leaving for forest and procession for all vrajvasis to see them go.
				Love - make each other happy thus pleasing Krishna.
			Balaram name - Garga muni named after being served - naming ceremony then kamsa will know whom I work at.
				so secret ceremony - qualities to attract universe by charming qaulities - ram.
				Strength and also spiritual strength so bala. Sankarshan cuz brings families together.
				All nature elements would serve the boys.
			1 asura Pralambasur with intent to kill balram - masquerading as gopa boy.
				allows them with thinking that I am fooling.
				His intent let me kill balram and then Krishna alone.
				showed scared as boy carried him to forest.
				Became heavy - so could not keep the guide anymore and showed up as asura - that's typical of SPOG - ?exposing.
				Everyday unique ways of killing asura and they would celebrate that.
				represents gross lusty desires. one more - subtle lusty desire - profit, adoration, distinction.
				Considered honorable in kali yuga.
				Such demons can be killed by Guru's grace so balram killed.
				Guru compassionate so goes out of the way to remove.
			Sambha arrested Lakshmana cuz had to marry and no hope.
				attacked and broke chariot and arrested.
				Not easy to take her you have to really fight.
				Ugrasen attacked Hastinapur but Duryodhan dear to them. Balram said I will handle.
				By unfair means you arrested so as friend return sambha.
				You are demanding this - you know aukat. Sleepers want to be on head.
				Balram silent and his eyes turned red. Yadus worshipped by demigods and they think we are at their mercy.
				Caste Hastinapur into ganga - said increasing.
				Came running - Sambha and Lakshmana - you have broken our false pride.
				Even if kurus to be dealt with - as guru tattva he would smash at right point.
			Didn't side with anyone - both will come - kuru or pandava side.
				he went on pilgrimage. Came to Naimisharanya.
				All sages bowed to give gifts - one made no attention - Romharshan - perfect sanskrit and shishya of vyas.
				You don't have to get up in one sense but balaram is not ordinary.
				Thinks he knows all shastra - seems like too much punishment but killed.
				We blessed for long life b4 this - you are SPOG - so atone for it.
				I can bring him back - father lives thru son so bless his son on father's behalf so Suta G
					2nd speaker of SB.
				SP - we have culture and philosophy; why different culture - there's no culture over here.
					On triggers, response - agitate others, gets agitated, not agitated
					Socrates Is it true, is it good or bad, is it beneficial to you and me else why think over it.
					You like to be here in the picture - windows to spiritual world.
			Lord st material existence - lifts curtain to see the material world.
				Misery is inevitable but suffering is optional.
				All VA if they don't help you develop taste for KC then shram eva hi kevalam (from spiritual POV)
			Nityanand - not plough and club but HN - but as beggar to give sth.
				going to most sinful - even jagai madhai.
				Just give. SP mood is same - enthu engaged 24 hr - engaging others in Krishna's service.
				Chanting - who is this Ram - Shri Ram, Parshuram, Balram, Radhikaraman?
				All 4 things are correct if mood, then we ed chant balram's name.
				Spiritual sword given and without strength you can't life like Rajput's sword.

				There is a fun with 2 parties competing and defeating the other - so balram opposes Krishna often.

			Ref - Nand Dulal Pr - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRL_C9Zvrnw
			Summary - Lord's compassion to jivas unnecessarily sacrificed by corrupt society - preach against vedas.
			Application - Vedas are not meant to be misapplied. Otherwise, they cause havoc (to e1) instead of benefit.
			Buddha - Daya aspect focussed by God.
				Dwarf trying to touch the moon.
					something to learn or one with different philosophy.
				Purpose - By vedas I am to be known. Deepen relp after knowing him is natural.
					Preacher goes to Vrindavan bus - drinking lime juice - some get down to get devotees back but they may also not come back.
					Lie that this lime juice is not good for the sake of higher thing that Vrindavan is waiting.
					Yajna or sacrifices is aspect of DS.
					What's offered to Lord has to be very pure.
					But animal sacrifices in the scriptures - that's surprising.
					Desires not pure - so some mentions of them also - allowance but not prescription.
					2K after kali starts - taken allowance as recommendations and started exploiting slaughterhouses on large scale.
					Meat eating seemed as bona fide desires - when leaders go corrupt.
					Lord took to himself to rectify - Denied the very vedas for daya.
					When Lord apparently preaches against vedas who can stop him.
				Life trace
					Siddartha - seeing bright face - are you divine angel - no.
						no extra information than basic information. Who are you?
						I am awake.
						King Asita was informed that may take to renunciation if sees world - gave all comforts and necessities.
						Shield from miseries.
						After 29th birthday - saw BODD.
						Huge party that night but heart was affected.
						Saw the ugly reality of life. Came across saffron sanyasi.
						He renunciate understanding the sources of miseries in life - BODD he will also experience but last time.
						This is what I have to do.
						Rahul child birth - pleasure that is dear to e1.
						decided for not myself but others renunciation - help overcome BODD.
						We have seen BODD - but don't think of circumventing but take for granted.
					Went to gaya and bodhi tree and developed enlightenment.
						bliss of knowledge - realized how to overcome BODD.
				What he did - Did sth important for that time - and preliminary principles important at that time.
					KK sacrifices. Narad to Prachinibharishad - sacrifices as cruely to animals.
						Mrigari told about revenge.
						risky - if not performed properly, then sacrifice becomes murder - the animal not raised to higher realm.
					can go to Higher sections is appealing to common.
						no original teachings but teachings as per TPC.
					SB in 10th canto - e1 can understand spirituality except animal slaughter doer - vina pashughnat.
						First be on airport and platform for take off for spiritual world.
						Playing cricket on streets.
					?Philosophy of negation to get positive conception of AT.
						Prabhupada thought as Pra-buddha.
						SP said buddist b4 - why KC now - In buddism, what reality is not but now I know what reality is.
							SP liked this answer.
						Zebra is horse like with white and black stripes.
							Another way not giraffe, not like this, etc - finally to arrive at AT thru negation.
						Teacher has master degree but students to be presented as per TPC.
							anya abhilashita shunyam - so that's what buddhism focusses on.
							What you think of buddists - They are vaishnavas but have deviated from buddhist's teachings
				Teachings
					Nadiya was place of arguments but not buddhism - big words but heart craving for material desires.
						arrow hit - who hit it - what angle vs correct it.
						burj khalifa - first gotta dig for a highest building.
							first foundation then skyscraper - foundation of purity and no diversion into KK.
							work down if you have to think up.
						DAKM and beyond foundation be proper - highest gift won't be attractive.
							For new to come, you have empty hands to receive it.
					Monkey could put hand inside jar but can't take it out - hunter comes and catch him.
						freedom gone for few nuts.
					Marriage at night but forgot to remove anchor - anchor is attachment.
						ye hi samsparsh dukh bhoga - If ill given pizza, some detachment is good.
						But well then still khicadi is not good thing.
						Most prominent religion is materialism - same tv shows again and food habits is same.
							just 2 mins in front of images and then continue with money hunt but so corrupted with this disease.
						3 types of vairagay - abhava vairagya - cuz not available - eg grapes are sour story.
							India is good country cuz could not go to US.
							shmashana vairagya - stays for short while in the boundaries of the ceremony.
							prasooti vairagya - short lasting as before.
					Get me mustard seeds from where no1 has ever died
						the lady came back that no1 in world like that and buddha said that's the world.
					Dacoit - take leaves from tree and then can you put them back.
						taking life is easy but not vv.
					Maturity of non-violence
						violence on lion to save violence on cows vs non-violence and let lion do his business.
						violence to a violent person is good - a jerk torturing others. Should you be non-violent.
						So gotta understand the principles.
						SA by LCM - bhava maha dhavaghni nirvapanam - that's what buddism does.
				Spread
					Ashok preached far and wide.
						in other countries also.
						Kandahar huge stone statues - Taliban shot them down.
					materialism so widespread that buddism is appealing these days.
						Be peace and nice for those in madness of world - more of mind to control it.
						No theological implications and spiritual world - when noise is too much.
						Not answerable to anyone superior - meditate on sound of 1 hand clapping - be where you are and peace.
					non violence was first thing but many buddists do that - think that we won't kill 1st hand but 7 elsewhere killed.
						6 people implicated in act of meat eating - kills, transports, eats, etc.
						Subreligious principles or upadharma help us rise on dharma path.
						SSC helps for higher studies but if SSC is seen as end then not ok.
						1 way to look at Buddha is mercy incarnate of Lord - cleverness of Lord also.
						religion without philosophy is sentiment or fanaticism and specular vv.
						Good platform to advance but some violence is inevitable.
				Master Plan
					Internals Covered - Vacakottar philosopher asked Buddha
						what about soul - nothing silence. Left.
						Why don't answer - if yes, then agreed with brahmins, else agreed with body is all in all then so is tongue and meat eating.
					Next comes shankar to defeat and physically driven outta India.
						In trying to refuse buddhism - gave purpose to life.
						Nirvana as merging into void or shunya.
						Cause of sufferings is lamps then extinguish them.
						Go to the place with no desires and merge with that.
						Practically no different but voidism was made into brahman - the difference - authority of vedas comes back.
						Intellectual clone of buddist void.
					Budda gave 0. Shankar gave 1. LCM why 0 or 1 but INFINITY.
				May Buddha protect me in Narayan kavach prayers.
					may protect me from activities opposed to vedic principles and laziness to avoid or perform them ritually.
					May I not misuse scriptures.

		<Kalki>
			Ref - By Shubh Vilas Pr
			Summary - Kali age people purified after Lord's appearance.
			Application - Lord purifies even the wretched.
			2 sources of knowledge and not appeared so not much.
				Kalki puran and SB - we will refer to SB for the same.
				Every incarnation has a principle lesson to tell.
				Castle on beach and heartbroken when taken away.
				Kalki comes and take eth away.
				Kalki very fast - when gone then bloodbath around.
				Market is small so try their best to be Kalki.
				Symbols, beauty - 6 opulence, etc.
			3 reasons for Darwinism.
				History of Darwin.
					No miracle in his life as a priest - many priest.
					Priests so much after power and position and wealth.
					Very young son died - so decided to find his own path.
				Started with assumption that God is not creator or controller.
				His theories always denied need for God to explain things.
			Padmavati - whoever sees her with lusty eyes becomes female and maidservant.
				Only Kalki passes the test.
				Rascals - Their wife as padmavati they say - Speculations that she dominates over man so they become females in front of her.
				Kali personification for age - Brahma bac adharma came + falsehood (illusion) -> dambha and maya were children.
				Brother and sister procreated -> Greed and cunning -> Anger and violence -> Kali (Boy) and Harsh speech -> Bhaya and mrityu -> Hell and excessive pain.
				Harsh speech is characteristics of Kali. Fear of unknown and death. Hell awaits.
			Symptoms of Kali
				Dharma diminish - Religions modify to adopt science - manipulate texts to accomodate science for more congregation.
					Spiritual life vanishes in the process.
				Truth Diminishes - every word is a lie.
					99% times it is a lie.
					How to monitor an employee - no principle of truth - tech can fail and you can cheat.
					cuz Not interest in AT but only relative truth.
					Dashrath didn't want Ram to go to forest - hoping that Ram won't go breaking promise - attached to relative truth.
						his attachment to relative truth so heaven and not spiritual world.
					Great dharmik person relative truth showcasing and rejected AT.
					Vasudev - first 6 child truthful but for Krishna he took him to Braj.
					relative truths change.
				Tolerance and forgiveness reduce - even small mistakes ppl don't forgive.
					simple mistake of stepping over 7.
					mind not pure so attached to petty things.
					water doesn't move as we go deep - mind of dev very deep and common people very shaky.
					People have Agitation to do something - can't read books.
					Husband wife - got wild with each other - threatened to throw child out of the window and she did.
				Balam - lesser strength.
					Can't lift weight. Back problem with e1.
					constantly in 1 posture.
					What's the point of counting calories if no energy inside.
					Energy but no essence of it.
				No memory - remember phone numbers
					but even his own number. Sources of memory for their memory.
					Phone is gone - all memory is gone.
					Karna got all the data but Parshuram changed the password - it's not just knowledge but change of heart.
						Got knowledge but didn't please the Lord.
					Lots of knowledge but not practically useful.
					Hanuman so eager to listen that no data loss - flew along sun while class was going on.
					Guru Dakshina - be the secretary or minister of my son Sugriva. No fault finding done by Hanuman.
					Krishna from Sandipani moon - wood getting and lost way - determination to service - whatever you learn, you will never forget.
				When wealth as criteria for proper behavior.
					Wealth so supposed to be well behaved.
					Good family if has wealth.
					High class if you have wealth vs behavior to increase well being in others.
				Law and justice based on power.
					Looks like chanakya was power hungry even his disciple thought so once.
					Kingdoms would shake by his actions.
					He would not speak his mind so no1 would know.
					Eth set right then he walks off - detached brahmins. Teachers never rule.
					Law is unequal - I was Lawyer b4 KC. Company saying that prove that false and original.
					Find points law is like gold and once hot it's flexible - flexible manipulate to whims and fancies but laws of nature don't work like that.
				Top
					If ability to consume is higher then topper. Take more.
					How use it is not asked. Consumerism is important.
				Men women live together for superficial attraction.
				Success on business - deceit ability.
				Brahmin known thru thread.
				Good woman if sexually attractive and also with men.
					Heros are ones with sex appeal.
					How promiscous more advanced you are.
				Good in juggling words are great scholars.
					word word word - it's illusion said one speaker.
				Men wear robes from flux or lenin, grains like millets,
				men regard wives as friends, cows extinct,
				Planatations near river but still crop won't grow.
				Father will enjoy what belongs to son and vv. No joy in things
				and festivals in strong.
				This is Markandeya telling to yudhisthir after great efforts that eventually in kali this will happen.
				People accept gifts after curses. Can't give sth better - gratitude gone. Gifts are my rights.
				Rulers unable to protect so pleasure in punishments. I can control them.
				Average age becomes 16. Girls at 5 will get pregnant and boys at 8 will become fathers.
				Wives will hate to serve their husbands.
				Shudras will explain scriptures eloquently and Ravanas will sit and hear.
				Earth will be disfigured by tombs and graveyards than temples.
				Disciples will plot to kill their teacher.
				Wives fond of tears. Beautiful based on hair.
				Filling belly as goal of life.
				Pious - can't stay in cities and will rush to forests and mountains.
				Famines disturbances.
				Body greatly reduced VA practices reduced. Kings as thieves and needless violence.
				Spiritual hermitages like family houses. Family ties no further than bonds of marriage.
				Only religion will be atheism. US stated - you can have religion without God.
			pastimes
				Internally e1 is looking for hero to come and change things.
				Tell me a person without flaws asks Valmiki - practically you find no1.
				Narad Muni tells I will tell you - 24 qualities - trembling - it's lord Ram.
				Kalki will appear but only after 4.27 lakh years.
				Born in brahminical family but will take kshatriya training.
				Will have a horse called devadatta - will travel across world and destroying rulers dressed as namesake.
				sword from Siva and Parvati.
				Padmavati marriage - Shukadev is parrot in spiritual world.
					whatever person sees her in lust, becomes woman.
					Parrot tells about Kalki and get marriage. Excitement is created - love stories fulfilled.
					Film story full of love stories - they came together in unique ways overcoming unique problems.
					Devs Married to Lord - it's also our marriage with the Lord.
				Killing mlecchas. Husbands dead and wives will come out with weapons to kill.
					Take shelter of kalki their weapons would say.
				Kalki in junction of kali to end and satya yuga to start again.
					SPOG function is always same as Krishna told in BG - 3 things.
					Jarasandh's son was appointed as king after him.
					Vibhishan made king. Sugriva made king - that's Krishna.
					Kalki establishes a VA system and walks away.
					These days only get money and not what my VA is but where are grats.
			Applications to our lives
				Not wait for him but align to him.
				How can we become instruments for Lord and not kali.
				Culture and Vulture - 1 letter difference - without culture it's vulture - feast on faults, etc.
				1 story - 2 vultures their heads banged by 1 atrocious person against shaligram stones by chance - they went to heavens.
					came back and perfect their lives.
				Don't surf but dive - humility is bending to go higher.
				ceil with wax in old days - colors meant something - solid color wax.
				Great devs heart like wax and Krishna like color.
					once together Krishna can't be removed from devs.
				Krishna in 3-bent - difficult to put in and once in difficult to bring out.
			QA - Scary description vs sarvatra pracar horibo moro naam.
				That's separated by 4.2 lakh years apart.
				Every town and village - golden time in dark age - only 10K years.
				that's like golden ring with black backdrop.
				So also if not availing this then what hope is left.

			<KrishasTuBhagavanSvayam>
				Ref - Nand Dulal Pr
				Summary - Krishna enjoys rasas in the world to attract jivas to his abode and kill demons in the process.
				Application - allow yourself to get attracted to Krishna. Demons will be gone as a side-effect.
				Hinduism - allege that they impose human conceptions on Gods.
					Even fish god, etc so not just anthropomorphism - widest encompassing conception of God.
					why appear in different forms - water ew then fish birth.
					Not Krishna but Ram is SPOG - same person will seem different in different situations - like diamond different colors.
						Even we are different in different settings - different rasas.
						Can 2 statements be simultaneously true - sq root of 25 is b and c - 5 and -5.
						Depends on frame of reference - scheduled incarnations. Not time table cuz not forced to follow time.
				Krishna is source of Vishnu
					Paramatma expanded from Kshirodakshayi is source of all - what's source of kshhirodakshayi. Is it possible?
						SB mentions that yes, it was source from garbhodakshayi - big Vishnu.
						garbhodakshayi from karano dakshayi vishnu - mahavishnu.
						Does he have source yes - it is detailed in SB.
						Source? Yes from sankarshan (that's spiritual world now)
					All candles but first candle which lit all remains the first.
					fulfill desires is 1 reason to approach - nth bad about it.
						how huge is horizon best of city, nation, earth - dhruva wanted to be best of universe.
						Mother guidance, Narad's guidance, penance, meeting Vishnu.
						Got Vishnu then horizon grew the bounds and said that didn't want it anymore.
					But for practical considerations officially Vishnu is source of incarnations. (?who do demigods approach, what's official, what Krishna anyways come thru)
				Ete ca amsha kala pumsa - either portion or portion of portion of Krishna.
					comes again to world again.
					transcendence is beyond MMN and iminence - present in world.
					Form image of God - cuz God transcendental can't come to the world.
					can take material form but doesn't get contaminated or limited - just like as fish.
					That person so strong - that he can do what all - even manifest in material - don't contradict lord's power.
					Akbar to Birbal - Why would God come to the world - these stories are indicative and historicity is questionable.
						Shallow boat festival - Akbar jumped into the water.
						My baby why would I call 7 else.
						Love for son - no consideration of position or etiquette - we love God.
						Puja is not focus but Bhakti is the focus of parampara.
				Mama man mandire song - compare mind with temple and all activities.
					Manas puja.
					Details are important but mood of arati is more important.
					Procedural details are the how but why is also important.
					Deity worship is said to be in Vatsalya rasa - gotta take care of the deity like child.
					Love God is rarely taught - demands on favor or weekly rituals do happen.
				Birthday you go to temple is it not normal - yes some on duty platform.
					FDDL - no problem with current platform but great if grow from where we are, right.
					Sudama and his wife only asked to meet Krishna outta concern for each other - that's the consciousness - each other not me.
					Protective orm of Lord is good.
				Krishna's qualities 4 extra.
					Rupa Madhuri - the way he stands. 3 bends - neck, waist, leg.
						Vidura and Uddhav discussion. Form of Krishna - most beautiful creation of universe (scope or horizon kept at universe)
						Krishna makes ornaments beautiful that's his beauty.
						Lakshmi comes to Vrindavan to meet the form of Krishna. Belvan or shrivan - praying to Krishna to enter.
						Aishvarya position needs to be left for madhurya.
						Mahavishnu wanted to take darshan of Lord so stole a brahmin's child away from universe which Arjuna could not find.
					Venu Madhuri - Non moving object stop and vv.
						Stones melt, calf keep the mouth open.
						Bees stops, grazing animals stop.
						Kumaras get agitated. Anantnag also starts shaking with universes on head.
						Any desire to enjoy world, don't go in midnight to keshi ghat near yamuna - very attractive.
					Lila Madhuri - very beautiful activies.
						Sweetness in childhood days. He steals butter - maine hi makhan khayo.
						Krishna late to meet gopis cuz with gopis - O we will meet - Durvasa is my guru.
							wanna meet him - asks yamuna that Krishna is best brahmacari - laugh but it works.
							How cross back - Durvasa - who just eats durva rasa - you ate eth in snap.
							discussion - ek thug guru, ek thug chela, dono ke beech mein thagini.
						Draupadi had taken food from akshay patra. Durvasa famous for cursing and disciples learn from guru.
							Krishna gives a new problem - food and forgets 1st problem and cries desperately nth unfortunately.
							show me sth - it's our remnants - does not apply to me recall shabri.
							Krishna was priority - his curse will handle but not Krishn'a unhappiness.
							Krishna snatched poha from sudama earlier.
							Ambarish M problem last time so he left - here 5 devotee kings and Bhima coming.
						Krishna helps in invisible way - Saree becomes unlimited for Draupadi.
						Krishna invisible help to Arjuna in BG.
					Bhakta Madhuri - Devotees of Krishna are very sweet.
						Pandavas never complained.
						Gopis apparent arrogance to blame Brahma that imperfect creation.
							adhikar cuz they can't tolerate separation from Krishna for microseconds.
						Krishna didn't come back but waited for a promise.
							1 sentence promise from a cheater (maine hi makhan khayo) and waited.
						Ram pastime - brought Sita back - doubted. Eternal Ayodhya fell short.
							Loyal to Ram throughout. Situation where they can be separated but Vraj - never separation.
						Vrindavan flute to call Gopis but all already there in altar so who he plays flute for - for us to come to him.

				Ref - Shridama Prabhu
				Summary - LCM appears to spread HN yuga dharma under acintya bhed abhed tattva for unfortunate kali folks.
				Application - Accept HN and get attracted to supersoul.
				Krishna - says ramanti ca - some eye on results makes it relishable.
					same person et is good but different flavors - some people have different desires - Krishna satisfies them all.
				CC - KDK prays that may LCM take shelter in innermost core of your heart.
					He gives what is never given b4 - most merciful - conjugal love of Krishna.
					To most unfortunate people of the world - LCM gives the highest thing possible.
						Astrology your face movement tells sth unique - I am not concerned about my future; didn't you listen to class observing my face.
					Memory but no phone numbers - SG desire fired up, eth else is weak.
					LCM gave nectar and SP distributed nectar like water - this is parampara of magnanimity.
					6 Gs after meeting LCM - done with role of PM, etc.
					Full time to Krishna. Nothing can stop when call comes - tyaktva toornam ashesha mandal pati.
					Prayag was flood by HN chanting - never flooded although confluence.
				Navadveep scholars - storm of procession.
					Keshav Kashmiri - Saraswati on his tongue (Kumbhakarna tricked by her)
					If LCM defeated then oh only grammar teacher but if wins, our grammar teacher defeated.
					Pride and LCM reduced his pride - humility is adored by LCM.
					But sensitive so I will defeat him in private.
					LCM TPC how to correct so praising him - I am just grammar teacher and not able to impress even children.
						Just some poetry I know.
					Composed on spot on Ganga glorification 100 verses - no greater poet then you.
						first anaesthesia and then cutting.
						So brilliant that only you or ganga can understand - like what fantastic class only you understood.
						Let's analyse some good and bad points in the composition - that was shocker.
						Don't listen good advice when pride - there can't be anything wrong - Saraswati on tongue.
					4 problems with the verse.
						Subject first predicate later. Learned is this man is not correct grammar.
						Viruddha mati - bhavani bhartu - husband of wife of shiva - it means that bhavani has 1 more husband.
						punar yukti - ta repeated 5 times anupras - do it properly you forgot the 2nd line.
							shrutidhar and found mistake also.
						Shri makes Lakshmi - redundant - glorifying mother ganga so good job.
						ganga from lotus flower - so feet as lotus is good.
						This is sample - I can find 100s of faults. Speechless - why Saraswati left it.
						Sensitive LCM - other laughing popat ban gaya (sorry should not say this)
						Please don't laugh he must be tired; he is a very respectable man - read books and we can discuss tomorrow.
						Defeated for the first time - dishonor is worse than death. Best is to do big things but stay small.
						That's my master said Saraswati.
				Culture of respect to be taught.
					LCM as Advaita relp - Lord themselves - you are SPOG.
					Respecting parents and seniors is what SP taught.
					Eg - 2 initial devs Tomskinson's park - go pay dandavat to parents - we Indians dilute maybe he didn't mean that - they followed verbatim.
					Preaching mayavad by Saurvabhaum - LCM very angry.
						what he says - hoye sarvanash we don't listen.
						pot inside and outside merge.
						Pulled from high seat and started beating.
						Stopped beating he will die and Advaita in bliss and laughing - where is respect gone. You accept me as servant.
						Will to respect is very strong in devs.
						Amanina maandena is verse to be strung around neck.
				Gundica marjanam for jagannath temple.
					enthu is sign of life - his enthu was contagious.
					spick and span for lord to reside - most dust collected.
					Faster cleaning.
				LCM and Ramanand Ray discussion.
					RK service is highet thing.
					Most valuable thing in world - love of RK is greatest riches.
					Sanatan touchstone - find it in dustbin - which treasure is greater - throw it - HK MM.
					Most painful - separation from devs.
						losing youth, etc also but greatest is devs.
					Who is actually liberated - saturated with love for RK.
					Best of songs - pastimes of RK.
						why song mixture - 24 carat is not possible - some impurity in me also.
					What to think about - Think about Krishna.
						takes from kanistha to madhya.
					Where to live - Vrindavan. Go there? - can take for granted so make home Vrindavan.
						We should go but not indiscriminately - not knowing importance of it.
					Beautiful deity - RK.
					Same answers RK - establishing the same thing.
				Radharmahima prema rasa seema jagat janato ke.
					purify our hearts - janma sarthak kari then paropkar.
					country becoming paupers.
				Chand Kazi was Kamsa in past life - converted him.
					LCM cured the disease and didn't hate the diseased.
					That's what we should do.
				Bonus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YKVXU1MqZ8 (Shubh Vilas Pr)
					born with HN - that's what matters. Only SA as his book (only scholarship which matters)
					strictly against mayavad.
					Haridas Thankur revered by LCM highly

				About - Milk Churning - Ajita, Dhanvantari, Mohini Murti.
				Ref - HG Radha Gopinath Pr
				Summary - Instructions followed leading to Lots of outcomes of samudra manthan including amrit. Lord as Mohini gives amrit of her seduction to asuras and nectar to demigods.
				Application - Lord gives e1 what they need or persevered for. Lord appears to be biased to demigods cuz administration is planned that way.
					Aligning with lord yields a lot of other things along with amrit but it's all worth it.
				likewise there are many such pastimes - as many as waves in ocean. Kurma, Ajita, Dhanvantri, Mohini Murti.
					WIIFM - There is AT tattva in us and we gotta learn from the instance and apply in our lives to excavate.
				Durvasa Vaikuntha garland and given to Indra and Indra handed to Elephant who trampled it - smiled and left.
					smirked thinking that it's your ending indication.
					Indra came to roads when attacked by demons.
					Punar Mushika bhava - mouse, cat bhava, dog, human, lion and wanted to eat - punar mushika bhava.
					They served guru very nicely so try to strike a truce with them with allurement for amrit which they find attractive.
				Manthan won't be easy for the milk ocean - so gotta do together.
					3 neeti - Brihaspati, Kanika and Shukra neeti.
						Saadhya and Saadhan (goals and end) both good. Eg Yudhishthir.
						Any goal, any means. Eg - Duryodhan.
						Good goal, any means. Eg - Krishna.
							if crooked person, then use crooked means to tackle them.
					?Metaphoric - the good and bad tussle in the world eventually emits amrita if purpose is same.
					Intent that let them take out - would slap them and take it away.
				Setup
					Mountain can't be picked up - Garuda lifted it.
					Garuda so powerful cuz Krishna makes 0 to hero and vv.
					Ajita held mandar from top and Kurma from below.
					Vishnu said whatever they say simply do it saying yes cuz they are powerful.
					Head on our side and so garal tasted but ego issue so didn't accept mistake.
				Outcomes
					Vish - Shiva can't see any's pain - drank it. Vaishnava jan to.
						Bhushan for him - neelkanth.
					Kaamdhenu - Yajna ghee so take it.
					Uccaishrava - Bali got it.
					Airavat - Indra got it.
					Kaustub, Lakshmi - var then karodpati but saw good and bad in all then Vishnu.
					Dhanvantri with Amrita comes out.
						snatched and Demons fighting who will drink first.
						like political parties win and decide who gets results of victory.
						fighting for a seat while seat not even there in mumbai local - I sat but I didn't rise.
				Beautiful woman - so much that you will be agitated and even I so won't be able to finish.
					When Krishna becomes woman, no1 can be more beautiful.
					playing with ball and their heads moving with the ball.
					E1 thought that she was looking at him.
					Who drinks nectar - I suggest I will drink - take it they said.
					NOC from e1 - whoever you give. E1 thinking that they.
					Demons got glance and demigods got nectar. Like mummy pleasing both.
					You are bigger brother like mummy says - 1 drop to them and you get a lots
					The glance they got felt more valuable than nectar to them.
					Rahu got into senses and got into demigod line and oh he is demon and sudarshan released to kill.
					But head remained so sun engulfs.
				Daivi is so weaker and demonaic is so strong that demoniac demands and daivi shakti can't say no.
					6 anarthas are fed so much that when they demand we can't say know.
					So take shelter of Lord - manthan and get amrita.
					Nectar is sweet. But use it in daily language like we do daily.
					Nectar - Sweet, Energy provider and ayu increaser
						Hari Nama amrita cuz crore Rs to leave KC - no, that I won't.
						Shakti - didn't have power to go to satsang and to say no to bad habits but now easy.
							now ability to say no to bad proposals. tu badal gayaa - kahaan tak jaate the.
							Prahlad not fearful of Hiranya.
						Ayu - Spiritual world no BODD there.
					But for HN first vish comes out - poison - Rs 20 not given.
						Like cleaning a very unclean room - makes it worse than before.
						Devs tell what comes - like pregnant lady is told from superiors.
					These tendencies in states, nation and world - daivi and asuri and tuscle happens.
					Externally there goal were same but different results for them.
						some wanted to enjoy and others wanted to satisfy Krishna.
						Like Arjuna fighting for Krishna.
						Grihastha for good sanskar vs Grihamedhi.
						Mein manthan karta reh gya - dhobi ka kutta - got nothing without pariksha.
						neither worldly grats nor trans - but Krishna gives it finally to demigods.

		Application - ???
		Lecture 1 - Hiranya set up and Prahlad Face off.
			Deity altar Prasadam forms - Flower, chandan, cloth, ornaments, mahaprasadam
				offering flower - may this prasad change the journey of the soul. Freedom from material realm.
			Vedas like IDT gives what we ask for but when ask what is best you can give then we get KC.
			Krishna left - along went dharma, knowledge, etc.
			If goal is Krishna then why not jump into 10th canto - take a flight to kolkata.
				Parikshit had 7 days and was justified but was done gradually
				RK pastimes are very exalted; cultivation - Prahlad M - cultivate qualities for what's coming.
			Sthanu is angry and RK is love - no mixing of moods - Narsimha removes obstacles on path to RK.
				we wanna protect Lord and not protection from him - Now Narsimha already protected and made proclamation so approaching in that way.
				Even if obstacles, may lord give us strength to face them. Kaam chahe bigada hai, dost hamara tagda hai.
				?no difference in lord's anger and lord's love.
			We say Lord is impartial or unbiased - but devs always win.
				desires to achieve - one who helps friend; does not then enemy.
				Small shoe whom do you remember - neighbor's child or your own child - but that's dead matter - so seeing connection.
				Similarly, seeing everything in connection with Krishna.
				Parikshit doesn't hear KK like gulp and remunerate later. But asks question.
			MMN - sth is dominant at a time and pushes other down.
				Similarly like in person, even in world st MOG is dominant and st subjugated under other mode.
				Agra Puja whom to worship - Sahadev says many great personalities but Krishna is also present.
					Shishupal - babay protection - 4 handed and one who makes him 2 handed, will cause his death.
					Devaki's sister's son - will forgive offences 1K but when Devs then I won't tolerate.
					Rukmini trusted that Krishna will come like lion to take away prey like jiva from material world jackals.
					etiquette that blood didn't spill else can't continue in that place.
				Devaki Nandan or Yashoda Nandan - no1 knows who he is.
				Jarasandh b4 dath - Purush-adhama (worst of adham), kurudhama, killer of uncle
					different meaning - the person in whose comparison e1 is adham. Purush-adham.
			In context of gopis prema often described as kaam - there is a shloka for that.
				Krishna so loving to pandavas that friend, messenger, watchman, saarthi, water giver, pranam doer.
				Gopis gave up household life; Pandavas stayed but left eth else.
				Kamsa was absorbed in KC. Can we call him devotee? no, cuz not favorable - anukulyena Krishna anusheelanam.
				Sayujya mukti to them - absorbed but no service so destination where they can be absorbed but no service.
				Devs absorbed in service so given a kinda mukti where absorption and service - destination which they want.
				No allocating as per partiality but as per our desire.
			Shishupal - who was he in previous life - trace from jaya vijaya.
				4 kumaras - inebriated by Lord's tulsi smell.
				Clothes on or off don't know - so with body. Plz cover. No, go cuz you are in duality.
			Tell me about first incarnation - so starts Narsimha description in SB.
				Hiranyakashipu mentality - gold and sensual grats seeker - same mentality now also but not that powerful.
				hiranya don't cry the body - BG 2 can't be given directly cuz of lack of emotional side although true.
				Hiranya explains story to show branch to show the moon of principle - Shaka chandra nyaya.
				He is still here - the soul is gone. Passed away - we know but don't want to apply - so different from body.
				PM in mental asylum - I am PM I also thought so come. 1 said - I am PM God sai; fellow said I never said so.
				Fantastic logic of hiranya - hypocrisy - knows philosophy but doesn't practice - comes back and says we have to take revenge against Vishnu.
				1K years - what a dedication - to get a goal going thru any limits. No step back - gotta fulfill his desires.
				Ecstasy on fulfilling desires - not ashta sattvik vikar but rajasik vikaar.
				Making plans for immortality - I am smart but kayadu has already conceived Prahlad - Krishna has already made plan b4 our plan succeeds - ?destiny.
				The actual boon was given to Kayadu as Prahlad not Brahma.
			Hiranya flipped rules of universe - do bad and get good and vv.
				Brahmins don't have propensity to cheat and stuffs but they are punished for it - ?gross and subtle.
				Prahlad par kaunsa grah chadh gaya hai - Krishna graha.
				If past is important then how mrigari and valmiki did it.
					If age, then how dhruva and prahlad. If knowledge, then how gajendra.
					If wealth, then how sudama. If beauty, then how kubja.
					If caste, then how vidura.
				Jayanand Prabhu - offer tree to Krishna. Salary. And service - goal is not to be famous.
			Prahlad honest replies
				No sugar coating, Prahlad speaks as it is, nothing to gain or lose that's why.
					Give up materialistic life and go to forest and do service (Vrindavan and seva).
					They also have bad association - devotees is bad association for them.
				Best thing you learnt - best? Narad Muni.
					9 proc DS - how do you know? magnet attracts iron.
					Not attracted cuz punah punashcarvita charvananam.
					Problem of limited resources and unlimited desires - 1 bone without meat and all dogs e1 fights for it.
					Don't have KC and loss of desire for accumulations and no more problems.
				Devs look back and don't complain but say thanks to Krishna - eg Kunti M.
					Kunti Devi looked back and saw Krishna; Prahlad looked ahead and saw Krishna.
					Dhruva M looked within and saw Krishna. SP looked around and saw Krishna.
		</HiranyaSetUpAndPrahladVerbalConfrontation>
		<NarsimhaSimilarToRadharaman>
		Lecture 2 - Narsimha similar to Radharaman.
			Rising and falling of sun takes others closer to death - aging but not with dev that closer to Krishna.
				BVT has checklist after death - gotta take birth in barsana.
				Sankirtan of NGRL during KK.
				Don't read - cuz lack of taste - cuz lack of priority - we think that my life can go on without this.
				Narsimha Appeared from pillar - Gopal Bhatta G appeared from stone - Radha Raman Lal.
				Narsimha appears to prove some statements to be true -
					Kulshekhar - so many jivas to think about but plz think about me as well as SoS.
					Preach in english told to many but SP made it a priority - miracles in 1 guru and 1 shishya powerful.
				We heard so many classes - but to Varmiki, Mrigari, Dhruva, etc - 1 class enough.
					eth is spoken to expand on some simple statements.
				Radha Ramandev - sincere combo of Prabhodhanand Sarasvati and Gopal Bhatta G.
				Externals of carnivore. 16 arms.
				Narsimha head reaching till brahmaloka - ?SB is a kavya.
				Radharaman - so small so in pillar or in pocket so didn't have to leave Vrindavan.
					No animal should kill him (why so asked cuz of history of Vishnu - varah, kurma, etc) but he made a mix.
					?perhaps he was feeling very hot when excavated.
				Ugram
					Krishna timid exploited by Yashoda - coming for lunch - come or will lock the room. Hide behind saree on lightning.
					Khaubhilau fictitious stones are the demons and pretends that they are coming.
				Vishnu means creates and enters his creation. We don't enter our gadgets.
					creates creation. creates problem and then solves it.
					external behavior like Krishna timid so such external behaviors but heart very soft.
				jvalantam - Krishna eats mud and drinking fire like mango lassi. Krishna also swallowed for gopas and gopis in forest fire.
					1 emits fire. Another engulfs it.
					agni serves the lord but when doesn't serve then krishna swallows.
					emitting fire means that yajna kunda is his mouth and fire in his mouth shows it.
					Dhananjaya - dhan given after fire sacrifice - made mukhya devotee.
					Forest fire - Krishna did that twice - once kaliya night and one more time later.
						once told to close eyes and not the other - look they have so much faith.
						ate mud and controversy so not gonna eat fire.
						Krishna protects whether our eyes are open or close. freedom from forest fire of distress.
				sarvato mukham - AT tells lies - my eyes are in every direction - Yashoda was running behind then
					SP - make you greater than God. Seeing yashoda Krishna - yes, but looks like she is greater than God.
				Bhishanam - Krishna 24 and half moons - hands and legs - nails are beautiful, smile, eyes, naabhi.
					moon is king as face. King hunts so face hunts and eyebrows and bow and glances are the arrow and innocent animals are the vrajvasis.
					how can this apply to Narsimha for bhishan
				Mritormrityo namamyaham - death for death and heartbeats for those who have it.
		</NarsimhaSimilarToRadharaman>
		<JayaVijay>
			Finite can't ever see infinite with its infinite attempts but fine can understand infinite when infinite outta infinite mercy wants to reveal his infiniteness to the finite.
				Psychologically,
					7 proud then we distance ourselves.
					Loving, genuine affection we are willing to strip ourselves naked to that person - all confidential details.
				Talented, skills then Krishna does not reveal himself to that person.
					not enough chanting then not enough taste or love comes later.
				Service done as burden. Garland making could be more loving to lord than a class preacher - depends on loving service.
			Why Jaya Vijay stopped - of course, not properly dressed but more.
				Devotees experience dualities
					Celibate concluded when a senior citizen ate flower - he has alzheimer.
					Devotee remarked what a waste before realizing the host's son was driving him to the temple. Shivers down the spine.
						cuz he was not getting car.
				In world of duality we st see apparent bad doers as bad while they might be doing.
					and st we mistake good doer appently, as genuine good doers while they may have bad intent.
				Vaishnava Aparadh - kill like abortion, nindanti (criticize), envy (dveshti), to not bow cuz of familiarity (nabhi nandati),
					Kridhyate (keep anger in mind), yati na harshati (not happy to see a Vaishnava)
					If we are late, then pretend that we have not seen him (playing atma paramatma game)
					So, kumaras have made vaishnava aparadh.
				Another philosphical aspect of aparadh - radh means satisfaction (inbuilt from SPOG on service) apa means gone.
					so if satisfaction is gone, we must have done sth.
					Types - Jiva aparadh, naam, dham, vaishnav aparadh, etc.
					Saubharya Muni - takes sides with fish and thinking as soul protector - curses garuda.
						Makes him bereft of Yamuna snana and natural food for him - so it's an offense technically.
						Did you lost his taste - yes. So, on seeing fish mating he married 50 ladies of a king.
					Chitraketu lovingly jokes with Shiva - SB keeps wife on side and talks renunciation. Must be very advanced.
						Parvati didn't like and cursed to be demon and it happened.
						So surrendered that not affected by reversals. Equal vision for hell, heaven, etc.
						Curse did take effect but he was a devotee consciousness in demon's body. No loss of taste or satisfaction so no aparadh done by him.
						as vritra he made a prayer don't make me lord like bali for sutal, dhruva given a planet, brahma given a realm, etc.
							or like yudhisthri king of all.
						I am waiting for you like baby bird, calf, conjugal lover - reference to valsalya, madhurya.
						May I have association of devotees always. Repeated BODD and wanna be done.
						This story is standout pastime of SB - others like prahlad, dhruva, pandava, ambarish have mention in other scriptures.
					SB always be served. We take shelter of Hari but Hari takes shelter in dev's heart.
						offence takes us off the fence of bhakti.
					But Kumaras didn't lose taste so they had not done offence.
						Waking someone else up for Mangal arti - you should go to BTG at least.
						MA missed is ok but stomach should be full - 1 way of chastising.
						Just like Don't go to bank of yamuna to lose taste.
					Krishna tastes simultaneous rasas - eg Krishna entering in wrestling arenas - Sakhya, death for kamsa, wrestlers as match, my child.
						which is actual and what are fallacies - all are true.
						Therefore Krishna is rasaraj - mellows at same time.
						Krishna or Vishnu has all the rasas except veerya rasa cuz no demons there.
							Altar opens - devotee pulls the curtain so that others can see the Lord.
				So, given all the details - no devotee lose the taste and Lord wants a unique taste.
					It was all orchestration.
					Kumaras willing to act in that way - bend their rules.
					Jaya vijay breaking rules of stopping the kumaras.
				Same as hanuman - vayu putra but cursed by child.
					Hanuman was naughty - ever see naughty child remember Hanuman.
					Devotee sees spiritual world is material and materialists does the opposite.
					Eg - I am married why are RK not married. Divinity is compared with mundane world.
					Metaphorical - 7 has ability and can act as sages to make him forget OR like jambavan to invoke the talents to facilitate service.
					Even with fire on tail - how can I serve Ram with it b4 extinguishing it - that's his consciousness.
					SP like hanuman and BSS like Jambavan - faced 2 heart attacks like Surasa and Sindhika.
						search for bhakti - mother sita. No clue.
						SP gives ring of HN and then reconnects devotion back to Lord.
				I am speaking - Speaker speaks on order of SM to engage himself in Krishna's service.
				QA - They were not in mahamaya but yogamaya but whether cognizant or not is a question.
					Electricity can heat or cool - so same energy of lord split into yogamaya and mahamaya
					Influence of MMN or not.
					Raghunath DG - looks most beautiful in red garment - big eyes, big smile, very powerful sadhika.
					Yashoda sees Krishna's miracles like dance on kaliya but never forgets that he is child - overcome by love.
					Forgetful of identity.
					Both forget Lord's identity - in maya but for better service or better grats.
					So, in this case they are not in either maya - they are in knowledge that let's facilitate Lord's veerya rasa.
		</JayaVijay>
		<DivineAndDemoniacFaceOffs>
		Part 2 - shubh and ashubh desires and they face off.
		Part 5 - revisited
			Hiranyaksha vs Yashoda
				Hiranyaksha satisfies Varaha Dev
					Varah as pig but didn't look ugly even if pigs seem to be in MOI.
					yajnik offerings he has become fat pig and has become foolish to take form of pig - at least bull or tiger would still be something.
					Varah first sets orbit of earth - first paritranaya sadhunaam then vinashaya.
					Firest weapons fight, then punches.
					When his associates face off they really get to offer him veerya rasa - anybody else would be a mosquito in front of him.
						so it's only them who could really give Lord the satisfaction of veerya rasa.
					So Hiranyaksha pleased Varahdev.
				Yashoda puts Krishna aside for milk.
					Transcendental lust for milk, greed for more, anger when denied.
					But all transcendental in case of Krishna.
					Why Krishna bites his lips - meaning?
					Anger people throw things on floor - yashoda was dhara in last life - how can show my anger.
					no anger to dhara so adhara so response to adhara - bite the lips or adhara.
				Now both of them made Krishna happy - samsiddhi hari toshanam.
					intent was not desire to please him but latter was the case.
					Garland made to please Krishna or to ego gratification also.
					Hiranyaksha pleased Lord's inner desire but externally against him.
			Hiranya penance severe.
				Even for material rewards we gotta pay the price of penance.
				In bhakti we need spiritual superior and follow the advice.
					BSS - what if wrong instruction - SM does not but even if he does - disciple's bhakti will stay protected.
					Taking shelter is not initiation but following.
					So, mind is replaced by superior so growth and evolution is guaranteed.
					Meditate that you are a tomato and imagine cars moving around to safeguard from becoming ketchup.
						now that we open eyes we realize that false ego or identifications is the cause of all these fears.
					Need Diksha guru and if not always available then shiksha guru different also.
					Why earth being wife not go to Lord directly; why thru Brahma.
						Brahma has 4 mouths so petition from 4 sons.
						etiquette of going thru superior.
						?FND - behavior to be effective.
				Ravan - Offering heads in fire.
					what austerity - but better be backed with devotion - without it even asuras do.
					Vibhishan got lanka but just shelter of Lord.
					Any good advice to asura doesn't work.
						Bali said you not fight with monkeys and wanna mess with Ram - return Sita
						I have not come for advice.
						Different room - Gold mountain, wow, let me lift it. Not able!
							Bali said nope, that's ear ring of Hiranya that was you when more powerful and Lord killed you.
				Brahma asks for boon - may I be you - that's asura tendency.
					If not that immortality then let me be smart and ask for unique.
					No curse from brahmins - he knew the power.
						Ashtavakra cursed Ravan on being kicked that Vanars will kick you left right center.
				Asutosh - quickly happy. Bholenath - so his compassion is taken advantage of.
					Boon of let me crack the head and wants to replace Shiva. Krishna tricks.
				Devotees -
					Kola becha shridhar - rain in house, banana leaves and gauranga prema purushottam and parama karuna.
						would do bargaining with him.
						buy from there but reduce price.
						pushing to ultimate limit and he accepting it.
						Imagine Lord coming to devotee for receiving his offering and not vv.
					Sudama changed eth except clothes and still stayed outta palace.
						cuz that's what took him to Krishna.
			Prahlad advises but not listened just like Ravan (in future)
				Austerity for your own mind - but not tapasya with devotion.
				It's all 1 blind men leading other blind men - then what's solution as per you - take shelter of hari.
				Bhakti ekanta govinde so he said Ekanta Bhakti Govinde - Radha and Krishna be together even if grammar is sidelined.
			Tortures start. Hiranya made axe in hands of Vishnu to cut the sandalwood tree of Prahlad.
				Marobi rakhobi jo iccha tomar.
				Treat me anyway you like cuz except for you, I have none else.
				Your treatment is your choice but my choice is to stay with you cuz you are my eveything.
				Krishna tests our preaching off the vyasa asana.
			Do you see your Lord here - yes I do - see Lord warming up for coming out.
				If I don't find him in the pillar then people won't find head on your body.
				Narsimha comes out tearing. Fictitious images Spiderman batman seen as fact but not lionman - that's fact made fiction.
				Eyes spitting fire, from mouth, etc.
			All conditions were met.
				13th masa adhika to destroy. Not inside or outside, etc.
				How could you keep your heart so dirty.
				I could not even serve Narsimha properly - my guest.
				Atithi devo bhava - and Krishna came without tithi - deva literally.
			Terrific Lord - again to Brahma - please do something.
				Lakshmi being asked - who why when. Never seen the form.
					Jiva G - She stays with him eternally in spiritual world - eternal form written in shastra.
					So to give credit to Prahlad under yoga maya.
				You are not afraid - lion is fearful for preys but not cub.
					cub outta preeti can do anything he wants.
					Dandavats and Lord enjoying - nails on prahlad and shivering outta pleasure - same nails.
				What qualification to see you being in Demoniac family - but you don't see externals.
					thinking how people around me are suffering - I was staying to help them.
			ask for benediction.
				do I look like business man to you. Not for business gain outta transaction.
				Plz take sth - ask that protect my father. That who kills, you wanna protect him.
				Ram comes back and bows to Kaikeyi that without you, I could not have this experience.
				In this world, those who offer amrita, we give them vish and Lord - putana came to give vish and Krishna gave her amrita literally - immortality.
					what of those who come to serve him.
				Vidura - first prayed for Dhritarashtra who kicked him out.
				SP - came to give vrindavan to others and back to vrindavan.
				Mango tree - throw a stone at it and it returns fruit - see the reciprocation level.
				Connections benefits
					Kaliya given liberation cuz connected to Lord.
					Amogha connection to Saurvabhauma.
					16 generations liberated - forefathers of previous life.
				That's already taken care for - ask something else.
					That's a benediction - let me have karma account of all, let me suffer and they BTG.
					No, can't give that.
					Anyone who hears your appearance never take birth again. Sure.
				Krishna broke pillar thereby breaking his ego.
					Acaryas - my consciousness pillar should also be broken.
			SP - introduced Narsimha arati when 1975 devs asked what they could do for good health of SP.
				Starts Narsimha arati.
				obeissance to Narad, Suka, Suta, 6 Gs, BVT, BSS, SP - distributors and SM - protected and empowered by Narsimha.
				Gratitude to temple management and parents.
			?Jaya Vijaya cursed so had to take birth but not that their consciousness would be gone but it has to be gone. But did they ever want to please Lord - offer him veerya rasa - nope.
				That was innermost desire while in vaikuntha but not while enacting the lila.
				So consciousness was affected unlike vritra. But fulfill desire of lord is acceptable.

				sweet dish preparation has efforts - we forget that.
				happiness without gratitude then selfish.
				Problems tolerated and solved both.
				Hanuman - buddhi bhakti and kriya.
				fire incident - brahmin vesh cuz no1 knew they didn't die
			Bakasur story - parallel govt - extortion.
				Application - Strength (internal and external) required for dharma - including women and they say women are weak.
					Be pragmatic (and confident) and not that God should solve it.
					Difficulties had made pandavas stronger and able to tolerate and solve anything.
					Citizens fault - staying under durbal raja.
				relp bad that our relatives here so didn't leave - but praised.
				Husband has greatest duty; wife - no, wife gets exploited.
				fighting for self sacrifice giving reasons. Daughter b4 marriage anyways gotta go; and meaning of child.
				son is soul. wife is friend and daughter is danger. She says.
				sanskar that kid also said I will.
				In danger, we think that God should solve it - self danger is biggest e1 thinks.
				Kunti argues - no, not brahmin and that too first time.
					mamta but also confidence in the child.
					Pandavas - sangharsh in life so could tolerate anything and also solving.
					USA - opulence but no training for troubles.
				Bhima:Pandavas::50:50. Anti-socialism - equality should be based on purpose.
				Mama, why self sacrifice asks yudhistir - not MOI, greed or compulsion.
					Niti she says - Durbal raja - then should not stay there but we mistake that.
					decision based on discrimination not emotions.
					To Kaikeyi - anything you ask whether dharmik or not - that's emotion driven. Decision beyond rights.
					I have confidence and track record.
					Weak women in India? You have never read these sections.
				Fat guy and eating - bhima ate it all - only veg not buffalo
					killed that guy and his friends ran away.
			In ajnat vaas - Kunti stayed at Vidura that they had to return back and not take sanyas.
				Application - Behavioral accuracy which elicits expected behavior.
			Shanti duta - Kunti tells probs not to solve but informing about life.
				They should talk fight not peace. Says Kunti.
				Some son Came back defeated against enemy - better you were not born - die hero is better than dying everyday.
				How hard hearted that wishing my death - that's in ur interest. Fearful, no worker, misdirected compassion - that person never grows. That guy won.
			Kunti to yudhistir - never fear fight - once mucukunda given free kingdom - no I will fight and get it.
				to all 1 by 1 - Vali's wife not trusted so defeated.
				What I hate the most is Draupadi's mistreatment. Tolerating exploitation is favoring their behavior.
				Arjuna chose Krishna vs Narayani sena not that he will fight and I will see.
					I trust my effort and your prasad. Not burden on Krishna but shouldering.
					not habit of God solving eth - Medical seat cuz KC - when study is 50% how is it possible.
				When stri biased to mind or intel. samvedanshil and rational talks also - what a balance in Kunti.
				We don't get Amazon food - we gotta click - do research for the dishes - different types of rice for purpose.
					Pot also need to be understood - Pot guru asked not SB guru - not Krishna's will so tolerate but bake it b4 usage.
					so effort and relevant knowledge.
				1 devotee - cow devotee - why God not helped - Kerala didn't help and cow can't survive there.
					Good emotions but not enough - need system - kheer won't be made if agni aparadh, pot breaks, milk curdles.
					Suji slowly.
					food thrown not good - vivah sanskar - 350 crore in Karnataka - so honor prasadam.
			Madri - I better sati cuz can't handle 5 nurturing - too much sacrifices - no bias, ability to tolerate, have money so let me.
				done oneself is appreciated but Kunti deserves more for her life.
			MB - Bharat - our history starts not 1947 but bharat kula.
				Kaurava dushta - you wanna hear brave or cowards - both - cuz Isho knowledge and mis-knowledge both should be known.
				Pandava life, hari, vidura foresightedness.
				Kunti's determination and tolerance.
				Secular understanding of flag - Saffron sacrifice, surrender, strength white - peace and clean. Green - samriddhi, prosperity and hariyali.
				50-80% of eb life is same - so gotta deal so events some difference but same experiences.
					Puncture of car is fact not why God did that.
					Nothing that happens to us is special - it's law of nature - Garmi - it comes as per weather.
				We get and should get what we pay for - getting 90% with 50% effort - they can't handle.
					Poor In Guj got lottery could not handle and perturbed - after spending it all - he felt relaxed.
					Heart attack outta happiness st.
					Karma and yoga go together
					Rice what to do with it - Kunti made kheer. Not alcohol, khicadi.
				After dharma established symbol and literally after MB but Krishna leaving
					yudhistir going to forest we will come with you said praja.
					smaran se vanchit rahenge - BTG.
					Madhupati not kadwa pati she says - let there be difficulties - no1 names child as kunti.
					Company's name for extra money - Johnson
			Shurasena ki putri - kuntibhoj se adopted.
				adopted at 7 - but she handled that mental turmoil.
				changing family is a trauma for the child.
				I was rejected by my parents. But if good parents, then good; she becomes strong.
			Kunti ki pariksha
				Durvasa blessings who is famous for curse - curse high probability but which one would be question.
				Durvasa cursed Krishna also - different temple in Dwaraka.
				Happy - using her back as table for food. Mantra given.
				astrologers manipulating get impacts in life but sharing without manipulation is fine.
				That blessing became curse cuz of her getting idle curiosity - small mistake but huge results for life pain.
				Surya pranam ed but mantra - sorry - I must do what you called me for. What will society think.
					if you don't then I will have to curse you; your benediction giver; etc - ego of sungod.
				Moon lineage and sun covered then karna comes out - eclipse happens. Very talented but eclipsed intel.
					I had separation all the life - parents, adopters, sun's warning, husband, children, relations.
					Taken care by the adopters.
					She Prayashcit thru the life - Vyasa dev - you are strong and clean so can digest it. You are not faulty.
				Population explosion problem vs what population is doing the problem.
			Kunti used Karna for self centered purpose - No, to avoid fight of MB that would happen.
				That's the wording of karna that people take - She does not plead or beg.
				Even small mistake of touching 10K Volts - it's gonna pain a lot.
			Kunti unlike Ramayan Kaushalya was equivalent of Sita in Lanka
				She is like heaven devi - Success - yash.
				Gandhari also troubled life - but no yash - anger against god that cursed.
				Life is happiness and trouble combination.
				Curious place earth - car but on a run - beggar but can stay.
					experience of dualities of life - pride and happiness of such powerful kids.
				Kunti's pleasure was kids. Draupadi's fortune to have Kunti and vv.
					both took care of Pandavas while others were away.
				She was healthy balance of sukh and sangharsh.
				Stick fight in Kerela - that's life - flexibility to face village life - st rain, st hot, etc.
					Sports should relieve of mental stress not increase it - we need sports Counselors
					Great soul but durvasa service is like living in dense forest but also literally later.
					Can't be artificial - clearing once is yogi - so artificial tryst and become hydrogen bomb.
					Got used to forest but go get justice.
					Begging does not get you justice but alms.
			2nd part
			Struggle in every phase of material world - Satya yuga also - hiranyaksha.
				1 willing to kill child, what would he do to praja.
				Kaliyuga - good people don't have strength and bad people also don't have strength.
				Krishna appeared cuz kings who have rakshasa mentality. That was greater than current times so Krishna appeared - dualities are always there - he does not keep appearing.
				All rakshasas not street goons.
				Life should be seen as a game. Tired but continues - defeated then depressed but continues next day.
				thru Kunti, give weightage to dukha sukha as much as needed not more - KY philosophy.
				MB e1 has read but how many really idolize Kunti, etc.
				Our sanskars => Our ruchi or interests in life. So, we feel sleepy reading MB, etc.
				Shoes shop asking for law details. Seeking wrong thing at wrong place.
				Garbha sanskar - gora hoshiyar and healthy - no1 says samarthya vaan - doing good for others.
				narrow minded - don't think about others but only oneself.
				Krishna's all marriages - in turmoil. Krishna didn't want to marry cuz treta I caused pain to Sita.
				Satrajeet alleges Krishna and all started questioning even relatives and praja - then Krishna acted.
				Lakshagriha - they stayed for 1 year as prince - so staying in place that can be set on fire anyday thru the year.
				Bheem - Hidimba - sin of rejecting valid marriage proposal. Ghatotkach was arranged by demigods as shield for Arjuna to kill Karna. So, they also scheme. but we goota do our part.
					another with Draupadi - controversial - and why not - even that time it was not accepted.
					Some so called scholars - Culture of exploitation - Seniors always exploiting juniors. Guru asking BD from junior. So socialism - so is their consciousness - even they see child exploiting mother thru breastfeed by waking her up.
					so need to hear from vyas.
				Draupadi - heard about her original and kautuhal which Kunti saw and arranged for them to go.
					Arjuna attacked in the way - defeated and asked by attacked - no guru and no grihastha after brahmacarya - not stable.
					Drona was not spiritual guru but martial guru. So go to dhaumya rishi.
					Guru comes to you vs you go to guru - latter is better.
					all in forest - dhaumya was there to guide.
					stayed at Shudra but good consciousness.
					Why bhiksha draupadi - Stri is not bhiksha - kanya daan - girl is not a thing?
						That's not the concept - bhikshuk is below. Giver is high and object given is something of value to giver.
						Word if spoken then never denied - the value of word. What if spoken - go back - not that culture.
					Draupadi knew children gonna die - but experience is different; once SB appreciated but chappal stolen - never came back.
					Not first time - Vyasadev gave eg in past and approved it.
					Can you make decision which you can digest for life - that's not easy.
						Yes, in general not recommended cuz we can't digest - but they could - Krishn married 16K cuz could handle.
						As per adhikar things are allowed.
					Sanskars degraded - no water personal but bottle; no personal cooking but event management team.
						Dharma to be in culture that it becomes attractive - Sita when asked to conduct nicely by Ram she says - no need cuz I know sanskars and next I am coming with you.
					No saas bahu bad story between Draupadi and Kunti - lecture in beginning what the expectations are.
				Donate to brahmins - difference of controllers and owners.
				Krishna in womb - VIP standing in line is respectable. Glorification that nature laws respected.
					he does birth lila but death lila also he does. Respects human life - we don't discuss for sentiment of eternity of God but SB mentions.
			She saw Krishna in agni, he saw Krishna even b4 in difficulties.
				It's possible for her. BG Krishna says - Arjuna see me ew. ?Purpose of life over and had gone there for that.
				Jivo jivasya jivanam - eating, profit from others, me rank 1, others suffer. Hinsa towards others in favor of interests. USA gone but had to leave family.
				If have to kill to stay alive - ask whose life is more valuable. Abort the child or die? If you die, you make child orphan or if they die, you never kill an insect but baby.
				It's a different culture to act in selfless way. Dharma sankat - that's difficult choice in that culture.
				should not say what's right or wrong without knowledge.
				Celibate had heart attack so fell - e1 singing Narsimha arti as if Narsimha will do the needful.
					1 Punjabi healthy doctor started beating him on the chest - he came to consciousness
					you were killing him if you didn't do violence here - many devs could not see and ran away.
				So even if kunti allowed killing of 5 people that's act of dharma
				Shastra also like layered cabbage - you keep going deep from superficial to real essence - dharma centered then constitutional centered.
				Ajnat sukriti to Nishada woman - sacrificing like Jatayu.
				Bhima poisoned b4; Now, why they didn't refuse - cuz they said excursion to move out and do some worship (?besides politics of letting nemesis think they are successful)
				Good ppl not to be sacrificed for incompetent people - 7 challenged should be given favor but not adhikar (position of authority)
					that's a wrong mentality.
			I have this regret - Karna rejected and children from demigods not husband.
				Vyasadev said - don't regret you have done it right. And mistakes, you could digest or handle that.
				SP asked - did rama eat meat - doesn't matter cuz even if he did, he knows how to digest it (the reactions). He can eat even fire or poison.
				You are not understood by anyone what to speak of even ordinary woman like me. Humility.
			Q - Arjuna illusioned in BG 1st chapter - he thought neutrality from seniors.
					it all happens spontaneously not scripted and written. where's rasa of life.
					Ignorance for life is good - astrologer telling how you will die - you will die every second till then.
					they acted in the brink of seconds they were in but we in armchair speculation can say what's right and wrong.
				Ignorance never dies on its own - you gotta solve thru knowledge.
		</Kunti>
		<Draupadi>
		Applications - Unity (represents India), Dharma in most provoking situations. Agni burns (handle with care)
		Intro - Draupadi - Sangathan ki kadi.
			Like Sita in Ramayan - huge description; Ramayan is 25K shlokas and MB is 100K.
			SB is ?18K. BG is 700.
			Brahmins have habit of truth so bluntly harsh from outside st but inside is soft.
				some people are sweet from outside but sword from inside.
			Once eat laddu with lemon flower very sour; New year - bitter sweet dishes to start with.
			Draupadi on birth - she will be cause of destruction of many kings. Gandhari saw not beauty in here but death.
			Genius have some madness also
				Eg - many people - talent but can't stay married - many fans but not 1 wife said you know what it takes to be with him.
				ordinary - mistake then self problem. But small mistake from VIP even generations suffer.
				Draupadi - no childhood she got. Krishna used the consciousness of Drupad for orchestration.
				such purity in her that people in her contact - misbehavior then had to get killed.
				So, draupadi special or genius.
				She is agni - when you play with it, then forest fire can kill but can good use.
		Part1 - Draupadi.
			Yajna for 2 purposes - dvandva - hate for friend and get relationship with Arjuna strength.
			Gandhari saw how - like blind people thru other observations.
			No1 tried to exploit Kunti but with Draupadi it happened so many times.
				Sita also suffered - Valmiki Ashram good sanskars for children although forced by praja members.
				Nala Damayanti - Gambling lost eth but left. Hears in vana parva.
				Gatam's ahalya - became stone but no consciousness so no suffering.
				Savitri
			Janma Sanskar 2 purposes.
			Vivah Sanskar - Blessing from Siva last life.
				Child mood swings cuz reflects emotions of people around.
				People can't stay together - consumerism also supports breaking family - for greater distribution of products.
				Kali real power in sang - Quarrel if together and hypocrite if alone.
					so together or alone we are either way trouble.
				If Draupadi would have thought otherwise, her father would have readily accepted but didn't happen - no vikar came to her.
				Bhima could not tolerate anyaya - kills kichak, duhshasana killed but still not satisfied - if possible for me, I would make him alive and kill in n different ways.
					mood swing in 1 person - imagine having to deal with 5 people.
					No mat-bhed cuz of Draupadi - how powerful wife she was at handling.
				Satyabhama asks Draupadi - how to have control over husband (outta love)
					bad question - many wives destroyed health of husbands by giving chemicals.
					Draupadi represents culture of India.
					Diversity is huge in India. With water, the language dialect changes it is said.
					Skin tone - so many flavors - not just gaura or krishna.
					Karagriha same clothes so as to discipline then.
					Punjabi relates more with west punjab vs kerela. Why?
						India was a set of states - 550 - Britishers connected them all they said.
						Some people unfortunately believe so - they sold their opinion.
						Nation concept was not given by Britishers as they proclaim.
						Tulsi bahuman. Tulsi was born in India.
							Bharat bhumita hoilo - Still India.
							It's not political unit - but a cultural unit.
							Britishers wanted to destroy culture but could not. Now we are doing their work.
						Shankaracarya in Kashmir - what's relation with Tamil Nadu - nothing but respect there.
						Kerala - Unni Krishna. Pakistan - Laal Krishna - flavors change.
			Gandhari Bhavishyavani
			Narad's niyam - kalah nahi failate - you created misunderstanding with Draupadi.
				Tells a story - 5 pandavas - misunderstanding among you can happen. Like Sunda Upasund - 1 soul 2 bodies.
				No1 could kill except themselves - same clothes, same adventures of killing rakshasas - Tralottama came said she would belong to winner and 2 fought killing each other. She won.
				Sambandha mein niyam nahi then problems show up - like giving money to friends - st both are gone.
				Pandavas stayed together with 1 wife cuz they followed Narad Muni's rules.
			Dyut ka adharma - Many aspects as I speak - deep insights.
				Jarasandha wanted to culturally and politically control eth - unlike unspoken rule of not changing people's lifestyle puja paddhati with rule.
				Yajna Dhritarashtra - tax department he saw and envious.
				Duryodhan - To get money one should be dissatisfied he said.
				Call them for gambling he said - Vidura stops Dhritarashtra. It welcomes destruction.
				Both Vidura and Yudhishthir part of yama - one instructs another causes destruction.
					displine energy and destructive energy of Yamaraj.
				Prema and Nyaya make it complete - only prema can't.
					Gonna kill Jaydrath then Arjuna prays to Shiva not Krishna. Cuz destruction energy is very important.
					Doctor needs destructive energy.
				Vidura says called for gambling and Yudhisthir said it's wrong.
					Shakuni on kaurava's behalf - wrong and no chance of winning.
					Started losing objects. Can obtain them again.
					Then started losing relationships as suggested by Shakuni.
						Reader get angry when reading that section - lost eth then loses wife also - lowest of low point as human.
						as if some energy making him do it.
					Vidura always said bluntly but not acted - please reject your son.
					Vidura said he lost himself first so didn't have right over wife anymore - e1 scared so said better she asks this question; bring her.
					Draupadi asked to come - Had she lost all objects yes. Ask if he lost himself or what.
						can't come Rajasvala.
					Ask her to come herself and ask in assembly - Duhshasan follows and dragged to assembly.
				Duhshasan was trained military - how can you do that she asked - all compared to death.
					begging for help from others.
					How come I am in 1 cloth - you are servant whether 1 cloth or nothing - shabd baan with hinsa.
					All powers gone from people - why husband not speaking.
					Bhishma asked - whether lost himself - it's difficult what's dharma and what's not - Can't gamble a jiva with will but wife is subordinate to husband so these intel people would know.
					Sabha and Sabhya word are related - when sabhya people come together else gunda gardi.
					Vikarna stood up - She is wife of others also so can't make decision - that's my decision.
				Karna went mad - you are that small person in age - truth is not related to age or other factors.
					when biggies not speaking why you speak.
					You are like body part which has been spoilt.
					Shastra says 1 marriage what are these 5:1 - offended Vyasa, Narad, Krishna, Draupadi Sanskars, indirectly.
					Such person is veshya whether or not wearing clothes or not - they are all servants - make them all divest.
					All crying till now - lamentation without action is lowest consciousness.
				Duhshasan already in action starts to misuse.
					Bhishma what he spoke - might is right - dharma only tattva and not practical then nothing can be done.
					Bhishma is learned from Shukra niti, Brihaspati, Parashu's disciple.
					Dharma has to be powerful.
					SP - why temple - would you come under tree.
					Chanakya - Brahmin's all qualities lost when poverty.
					Simplicity = poverty is foolishness.
					Poverty can be forced to act any way. Vikarna's powerlessness ended up triggering denuding people.
					Krishna Devaraya's wife would dance on sandalwood's beats on khambas.
					Then dance for me and then public dance.
					Kings can be bought these days - came to my marriage - has rates as per times.
				Draupadi when attempted to denude then no more asking - just calls out for Krishna.
					Acaryas tell - 5 husbands and no1 could protect but Krishna.
					This story is actually for us - Krishna was friend. It was reflect action, spontaneous Krishna's shelter.
					Even b4 Jayadrath tried to abduct - you are foolish you are gonna die - my husband is Arjuna and Krishna is always with him - you will die when they come together.
					She takes shelter of Krishna naturally always - when can't answer questions, what can they do.
					When Vibhishan came to Ram - Can't test no time, I think Vibhishan must have heard of Sugriva. Ram felt bad that can't call shanagat as sakami bhakt but hanuman also dear.
						Son papdi mistake small then stone it becomes. So sensitive even with cooking sth.
						Rice more time then raw or black it turns.
						If some wrong judgment about dev is not ideal.
					Sundar lok katha - Rukmini with Krishna Dyut - defeated et - 1 dev in difficulty so not in mood.
						will be late - won't make it - then Garuda. Dhruva present outside - then also late.
						Until tears from eyes full helpless but MB tells it was sudden.
						We tell stories that she tried herself and then sari in mouth - all that's good but MB tells sudden.
					Heart of Ramayan - Vibhishan Sharanagati and MB's heart - Draupadi's sharanagati.
						all the reasons to break relationship with 5 husbands - had become impotent in 1 sense, were speaking dharma.
						Bhima said bring fire will set yudhistir's hand on fire - that's what they want - us to fight.
					Drapadi mahan bhakta - All elders thought make her free - if she is free then patni-tva is lost. If dependent then dasi.
						Bigger sin in their mind is making her lose patni-tva will cause her destruction so were emphasing that aspect.
						They were bound by so called dharma but biggest dharma broken - jiva daya and Vaishnava Seva.
						To think that she is wife is secondary characteristic of jiva. Primary is Krishna's devotee and friend.
						No1 agreed to protect her like Jatayu was ready for Sita's protection - they all became worthy of death.
						Her behavior - No bitterness for husband in public but in private, did purification not thru cuss words but shastra praman.
				Duryodhan said sit here - will break it.
					Frightened no response after that.
					Draupadi so dharma parayan - until this judgment comes from my superiors I won't accept this.
					She once said to Pratikami - that struggle comes in e1's life but dharma followed in that time gives upliftment. This sanskar she had.
				Bhishma after vastra haran praises - you want to do dharma even in such situation is praiseworthy.
					he had earlier delegated question to Yudhisthir on freedom or dependent
					Dhritarashtra - I am very happy seeing this quality of yours. Ask for some boon - free my husband from slavery implies all freedom as per argument.
					2nd boon - my husbands. 3rd - no degradation if I ask for 3rd - kshtrani.
					Modern education in our bhakti shastri - forget the next day.
					Never forget the knowledge when in desperate times - same boon given by Sandipani muni to Krishna and Sudama.
					But Karna curse of forgetting knowledge when needed the most.
					We also like karna - forget Krishna's shelter in tough times.
				Karna praised - I never heard in history a wife freeing her husbands. Sarcasm for pandavas.
					karna was muhfat used to curse a lot.
					Yudhisthir, Nakul sahadev covered face came out. Bhima in anger with closed fist and teeth. Arjuna throwing sand - my arrow will answer.
						Draupadi with open hair coming back.
					Yudhistir was hiding his dukh.
					Drona was sold. Kripa didn't speak. Dhaumya - purohit came and went - yama sukta singing that 13 years yama will come.
			Part 2 - Draupadi.
				Dyut was not in letter - Krishna psychology doesn't discuss what's done is done.
				Krishna - relationship => adhikar.
					Draupadi says what happened to me and chastises all pandavas - dhikkar for dharma of Yudhisthir, Gandiva of Arjuna, Gada of Bhima, etc.
					Even you didn't help - but had given cloth - Krishna does not stop her or clarify.
					How could Krishna not come he is ew as paramatma - avatar concept has to be understood.
					Why Krishna didn't help immediately - asahayata ka pradarshan from Krishna - flavor of lila.
					Prema, vatsalya ka pradarshan when helps; how to solace such situations different flavor.
					Some say Draupadi had secret love affair with Karna - perversion - palace of illusion book.
						Karna was waiting for Draupadi to ask for help - only he could help but ego of her didn't help.
						Try this on her and make her ask for e1 in assembly.
						What people fall victim of is - superimposing their thinkings (which is not paap) on scriptural characters denying the details (that's paap)
						They were sadists according to scriptures.
					All those who laughed will die - nature may change but not my word.
					for disturbed not tell philosophy - karma for you - but talk justice - not immediately.
					Krishna accepted tears as offering.
				Draupadi - how can you forgive.
					Kshama has negative side - people get spoilt - bad habits.
					Danda dena vichar is necessary she said quoting a story.
						prahlad M and bali M samvad - danda and kshama which is important - anything too much is problem.
					Vishnu has shankha and padma for galti maanana and gada and chakra for danda worthy.
					SP - forgave thief first time but asked for arrest next time.
					SP in BG ch16 - Arjuna shooting arrows from bow is transcendence and not shooting bow in war - talking non-violence is violence.
					If you don't punish criminal he will do it again.
					Draupadi asks a question but seems atheist - uncivilized are enjoying and civilized are moving in forest that means God and dharma are useless.
						Yudhisthir thought wife is becoming atheist - so lectures - she says not like that but about justice.
						Bhima chastised brother you should have taken birth in Brahmins. Kshatriyas look for opportunities to give punishment.
						Yudhisthir who talking forgiveness gave a reason - Duryodhan has many kavach who are sold to the throne - it's difficult to kill them.
					Bilvamangal thakur - During draupadi vastra haran both dharmik and adharmik people caused her agony. Then she cried out Govinda Damodar Madhaveti.
					Some Vaishnavas explain why pandavas' misbehavior towards Draupadi was not punished as death (although devs) - ?they did suffer - Draupadi became their kavach.
				Durvasa Muni for cursing.
					Some ISKCON devs always criticizing.
					calls out for Krishna - he will not come again; I came cuz you called - cuz chastised b4.
					Krishna remembered not outta fear but klesh.
					Every jiva when leaving has prayaschit - asking forgiveness from e1. That purifies.
						complaining people come back.
					Krishna when leaving he remembered I could not help her in time.
					Yudhisthir blesses Krishna - May Krishna always protect your devs like this.
				Pandavas on hunt - even dhaumya not around.
					not for maams eating - SP said once Bhima ate as fact. So what - protecting oneself when nothing around.
					Not meat eating in mahabharat but could be in other scriptures - even if they ate could digest.
					hunting primarily for protecting rishis meditation areas from wild.
					Draupadi so beautiful - ladies used to think they better be males.
					Jayadrath also corrupted with beauty. He came who are you?
						You alone male and I female but you are here - not civilized for you to be here but I must honor a guest.
						Draupadi so dharmik - harmonizing was Draupadi's power.
					Allures - you can be my queen and your husbands are all corrupted and servants; why waste your life
						niti says leave such husband (which niti)
					Draupadi so intelligent that keep him engaged in talks until pandavas come.
						If Arjuna comes you will be pale.
						Dragged to rath and they came - killed soldiers and kings running alone. Killed horses - jayadrath on road.
						Yudhisthir again forgiving - he is husband of Duhshala and remember Gandhari so don't kill else bad results.
						Draupadi very angry on this but accepted.
						Bhima beating him blue and Arjuna recalled don't kill - why you reminded like a child.
						Bhima angry but can't forget elder's obedience so only insults.
						Follow Yudhisthir in future - special shave with 5 shikha.
					Conscious such mistakes - eventually he caused death of Abhimanyu.
						accidental mistakes are ok.
						People these days follow the same philosophy as Jayadrath and even Ravan had this.
				Virat Raja and Keechak same situation and Virat did same thing as b4.
					Virat Raja did same mistake; Yudhisthir same mistake of silence cuz incognito.
					Kichak was sheltered by Virat cuz subjugated.
					Anger of Bhima - against rape - he made ball - eth put in his stomach while alive after plucking.
					She was agni - the fire burnt Keechak bad behavior also.
					Keechak bros thought Keechak loved Draupadi so she will sati - Bhima objected.
					Bhima killed them all b4 Raja Ram Mohan Roy against Sati.
					Virat also deserved to be killed but tied familiar relations with so settled.
				Even bhima agreed why fight against ghamasan.
					which direction sun rose so you are fearful. He used to be angry against Krishna also.
					Draupadi understood shanti samajhauta - they want peace? If they don't, my older family will and fulfill my words and desire.
					Krishna said I will fulfill your words. Don't worry Draupadi.
					Krishna was lying against whom? If Kauravas would agree for 5 villages, like Jayadrath case, she would still have obeyed.
					She later would even forgive the killer of his sons in cheating
						vs Gandhari who cursed for bad sons.
					She reasoned that Droni should not be alone.
					Actually, scripturally if aggressed on lajja even once - can be killed.
					Else people may start to think that I will anyways be forgiven at least once.
					Krishna tried great effort to convince them. But their lack of decision, they caused the dharma sankar in the kingdom.
				vs Ramayan
					Sita people think soft - only from outside but tough from within.
						vs Draupadi tough from outside but soft from inside.
						both of them harmonized with great balance - when we understand these characters see their harmony.
					Valmiki shows real characters
						People of high moral character
						even showcasing their kaikeyi side (how change in character can happen), shurpanakha bad to worse, etc.
				MB - as per me - all pandavas great and friendly but Draupadi was Krishna's friend.
					Draupadi represented fire and brought all asuras together thus becoming instrument for Krishna.
					Draupadi - Tyaga, Samarpan, Kashta but king was parikshit - son of Subhadra.
						Agni when given offering - yajna gets nothing but yajna done, fire over but yajna gives fruits.
						Yajna that caused - Kauravas nashta, Pandavas purified and parikshit prasad came.
					Draupadi represents India - bringing together different characters and harmonizing.
						Surya patra - after she ate the patra won't work.
						Most responsible eats the last. Mothers and grandmothers feed others in those days and then themselves.
					Draupadi knew it all but used to use when necessary.
					1 Folk tale - Maya Sita was tested and real Sita given to Ram and where Maya sita went?
						She became lakshmi in heavens and came back as Draupadi later.
						She was lakshmi as Vyas tells to pandavas.
						Bad behavior then lakshmi then kali she becomes.
					She is and should be our heroine for fact - no matter what worldly VA.
						We don't side - Drona, Duhshasan, Bhishma, virat - dead as leaving
						We side vidur, vikarna, Krishna, pandavas.
		</Draupadi>
		<Vidura>
		Applications - Intelligence (never confused) - decisive => Neeti eg fire incident.
			Strength speaking bold truths. NKY life that touches Krishna.
		MB - Vidura
			Ugrasav Rishi - Life is like struggle.
				We think we should traverse thru it - MB will give strength - gotta experience and traverse thru it not just escape thru it.
				1 biggie social and spiritual POV and committed suicide.
					Counselor for others Bhaiyuji - Depression and committed suicide saying that he was fraud - that's violence without knowing details.
					Depression is not limited to only grihastas or category of people.
					All devoted people also get prey to mental troubles.
					This is not 1 event but that's reality - life is prose not poem.
				Shivaji M's guru - Spiritual engagement is life's foundation; Socially sensitivity; politically alert.
					all these have impact to your life so gotta be alert to them.
				Pandavas so much struggle they had to go thru.
					we expect happiness - lottery then heart attack - beyond quota also not tolerable.
					How to bear such pain.
					Life in forest was pleasurable with fruits and sanskars - But had a svadharma - reason was seva to be there.
					Decision should consider such superior guidance when rishis said you should go back to kingdom also.
				Kunti brought children from laid back (Autralian beach kinds) to political epicenter.
					all types of aggression they had to bear - burnt, poison, questioning their being - you are not kuru.
				Body and Soul
					Raja - Ranjan iti raja - gives pleasure to praja.
						I am not body but I have body. Gotta take care of it.
					SP - Krishna Katha b4 sleep, MB in morning
						talleenta ke liye KK, Samvedansheelta ke liye Ramayan, satarkata ke liye MB hai.
						All these together in harmony - bring simplicity and integration and harmony to one's life
						#that's my current semester.
				SP - every scripture has a psychology and to be understood and read that way.
					SB - prem; management in SB is not the mood.
					MB - not shringar rasa - rudra, bibhatsa, karuna rasa - like vastra haran.
						Not outsiders family, powerful, knowledge and influential - confidence being denuded.
						MB takes from peace to reality - world of imagination to reality.
					Pre-marriage shooting - no guarantee of 6 months - lakhs spent on foreign countries.
						e1 had to see it - this is not sanskar but rog - self obsession.
						Artha if not spent to supatra but apatra then wasted.
							Money given to prestige not brahmins.
						Most distorted marriages done in hinduism only - lakhs of Rupees spent.
					MB - invokes anukampa and sensitivity.
						do you at least shake on hearing others' turmoil - out of compassion.
						Commenting without even knowing the person as fraud means that sensitivity is completely gone.
						We all know that suicide is wrong but what all he had to go thru - how can we not be sensitive to that.
						Like Draupadi's vastra haran all had become insensitive - so great but said might is right.
						When great people are complled then adharma takes place.
						Our purvaj should be respected that they didn't convert in spite of aggressions.
						But unfortunately, without changing opinions, the ideology has been changed.
							They read MB, Ramayan and all but make Ravan as their hero and Sita is made a villain.
							Draupadi is seen egotist, Duryodhan is seen as hero, Karna as tragedy hero.
							Pilates of illusion book people read - karna is central figure.
							It says Draupadi went to pandavas for help and they didn't - that's wrong - MB only raised questions and didn't ask for help.
							She remembered Krishna immediately after Draupadi's clothes were touched by Duhshasan.
						Ravan abducting Sita allegorical to Leftist liberal ideology abducting the shastra ideas.
							Now this will be shown on Netflix and it will showcase that hindus are terrorists.
							television and such books become authority that karna wanted to protect - the ideals have been abducted.
							Karna was the one to propose the ideal of denuding not others - the real villain. People ask for Mrityunjaya so showcase them the shastra reality.
						sensitivity is gone
							1 person was told by fake godman that take bath from 7's child's blood to have a child and they did.
								the sensitivity is gone.
								Divorces happen cuz of self obsession not just incompatibility.
					I asked children - want to hear heros or cowards - both so that we know what to be and what not.
						Vyasadev - I wanna tell stories of bad people
						pandavas - good people.
							superficial - we say do good and will yield good results but MB doesn't agree.
							Doing good does not guarantee personal good returns but still good should be done.
							good in leadership - gotta struggle the most - but don't get the question why bad happening to me.
								We can't change the whole society - you forced to think that I wasted my life.
							Woman asked from newspaper - happy to be chaste - forced to be. We see others enjoying more.
							1 person told his son
								I could not grow to go to foreign cuz of my vegetarianism so you forget this principle and eat eth but grow to settle in foreign.
							But then why do good if no guarantee, even god gets attracted to them. Pandavas are the eg.
							Dharma is not pious activity, it is beyond that.
						Vyasadev - I will talk about gandhari's dharma sheelta. Kunti's tolerance and determination.
							see her resilience and her poetry - it's like sweet rice but what all it takes to cook it.
							It's not just prayer but a life of struggle to get there.
							paramatma avaaz dete rehte hain and we keep ignorance - become more deaf to it but he doesn't stop.
						Vyasadev - Wanna tell about intelligence of Vidura.
							Let's zoom into him.
			Vidura
				what was his power
					he was not social impactful, not king; not dushta like Duryodhan
						what this means is even to be bad and vile like Duryodhan is also not easy.
						REL people say don't be like Daud - try to be. It's not easy even to be evil.
					No Krishna's friend or so.
						petition to be attracted to Krishna.
						Imagine Krishna attracted to Vidura which is like goal of e1.
						Uddhav said that SPOG remembered you b4 leaving - Vidura not thought great but hair on ends and fainted.
						character so significant that wisdom of wise.
						In India many people try to give good advise but then so frustrated after 4 years that become as evil as the people being talked about.
						Historically - Good people have a limitation to be good but when they become evil they become more evil than evil commoners.
					MB is story of garbhadan sanskar according to me.
						In Bharat's time, Dushyan married to shakuntala - dharmik - kardam rishi allowed.
						You disobeyed father but not adharma so indirectly approved.
						Ganga and Shantanu marriage - no questions asked - killed children.
							never marriage on such conditions.
							years of gaali given at once.
						amba, ambika, ambalika - husbands gone. Bhishma asked to bear children in apt ways - no.
							Vyasadev said tapasya and pratiksha - even children to be born aptly you gotta have patience and perform tapasya.
							But she wanted maggi (2-minutes results) - No this must be done
								our shastras don't talk right and wrong - but actions and reactions.
								Beyond this Vyasadev won't do anything more - dev iccha hai they would say.
						sankalpana, tapasya and patience vyasadev said.
							Now first wife was waiting for bhishma but vyasadev came - so expectations vifalta so fear closed eyes and born was Dhritarashtra.
							Expectations always frustrated - this seed came from mother.
							Hoping sth and came sth else - not just blind but all expectations vifal.
						ambika - fearful - so diseased and abrupt death.
							cuz of sankalp not will of god.
						Go again - rani said I can't - so dasi brought to her.
							dasi - seva is sanskar and welcomed
							she was not fearful - vidur character s.t voiced without fear - spashta and never fearful.
							He became voice of paramatma for e1.
				Vidura said truthfully and boldly - Dhritarashtra gonna be corronated but he said as per neeti blind should not be king.
					We know truth but don't wanna be instruments (upakaran) cuz will make them feel bad.
					Struggling for truth is not easy.
					Mother sanskar - Vidura said Duryodhan that you don't know how to be political - speaking so bluntly not good for career.
						vidura knew politics but not conspiracy - was dharma centric so spoke truth as it is.
					Indraprastha seen and Duryodhan could not bear so diseased.
						what's the solution - Duryodhan replied samadhan is enemy of progress.
				Vidura boldly don't play such games and it will cause destruction. Vidura is upadesh representative of yamaraj vs Yudhisthir
					Nth will happen - Wrong expectation of Dhritarashtra again.
					Vidura yamaraj's upadesh representative and Yudhisthir - when upadesh doesn't work then destructive force.
					Yudhisthir never fought and wanted bad for anyone but what was caused by him - war.
					Individual will can't fight the universal will.
					Eg of Gandhi was worshipper of ahimsa and wanted to be devout to it.
						but biggest himsa violence ever happened caused by his ahimsa rule.
						history doesn't present fact this way.
						Such migration that never happened - and people that got killed is unheard of.
						obstinate or stubborn to any side is the one trying to avoid universal law.
						Fact of nature is violence and non-violence must co-exist.
						Young boy sent a picture from pak - good people ew ; doesn't make pak good.
					Failure is not opposite of success - it is part of victory.
						2 opposing forces and fire produced - burns eth.
					Vyasadev predicted fight after 13 years - Yudhisthir wanted to avoid so said I will follow whatever superiors will say.
						If I disobey elders then other world problem but I follow then this world problem.
						iha vs para sangharsh - arajakta - saralta != daridrata - poverty destroys all good qualities.
						Sin or crime is guaranteed when one is in poverty. Why Naxalism and not bhakti over there.
						Bhakti doesn't come from poverty or crime does.
						Dushta raja destroys his not just iha but other's para.
						India generally well off and poverty used to come once in a while - akaal caused.
						You will see that hampi temples, chittaurgarh temples but no rajgriha.
							forts you can see but not rajgriha - money management was known and donation used to be given.
							pre-marriage shoot out nahi karte the.
							supatra ko daan.
						Raigarh - no home but eth else can be seen.
							palace concepts came from britishers. They huge homes - they copied and insensitive to others.
						They worshipped lakshmi and Narayan together.
				Vidura never confused. What happened in past and what will happen in future.
					That's why Vyasadev says I want to present clear intelligence of Vidura.
					He never stopped saying that - not stupidly adventurous.
					He asked Dhritarashtra to stop it b4 it starts.
					Shakuni said you lost eth. You can regain eth challenging draupadi then described her body.
						Can mother's milk be compared to any brand milk.
						Draupadi's body characters can't be compared.
						Vyasadev - Kali 3 primary characteristic
							education will be sold and teachers will be purchased.
								Just to keep record good e1 was promoted.
							medicine will be sold.
								rice and stuffs - farmers take very less.
								Eat as much you want - it is middleman that take away everything.
								samriddi then donations desires come.
								Artificial famine created - dhanya will be sold.
								profit is not bad but chanakya says that most important things become privileged commodity.
							Beauty will be sold.
								how seductive that much it can be sold.
								Dhritarashtra also asking have we won - he also wanted - pleasure in that.
								Gandhari experienced her as death goddess for dushtas.
								Cricket match and lecture - britisher ullu banaya - narratives have changed.
								You can speak bad about Krishna, Ram, Rahul Gandhi but not cricket.
								1 spoke that cricket is only thing that unites India - how unfortunate.
					Bhuta bangla you feel it and if sleep then confirmed you feel.
						they felt that sth is problem.
				Shastra distortion for whims is nothing new
					Vidura stood and spoke - shastra is like cow if don't know how to take milk out, blood can come out.
						shastra is delicate - poison can be brought out.
						Karna can be made hero, Ravan and so on, etc.
					Arjuna told Yudhisthir that you caused guru's death like Vali shot from back by Ram.
						he accusing while Ram sitting on his chariot.
						You don't hear Krishna cursing Arjuna - gadha kahin ka, kritaghna, jihva toot jaye.
						I am doing his seva - dukhi hai let him do.
					Gopis also do - you are like this only. Mazaak or prema but Krishna does not take seriously.
						Vali incidence is mis-spoken but Krishna does not mind.
						love is superior.
						atma-tattva important but sva-dharma is very important.
						Same shloka that body is temporary can be used for escapism - anyways body's gonna end so why do sva-dharma.
							but Krishna used that shloka to make Arjuna active.
					More important than words is sth else.
						words can be made milk or blood or poison - you decide.
						Rice can be made veg biryani, sweet rice or animal cut and added to that biryani.
					Draupadi was wife but also independent jiva - if ignore any constitutional side or conditional side.
						both need to be seen.
						3 dharmas - svarupa dharma, svadharma and apa-dharma (circumstantial).
						Pandavas had to ask for alms was only in emergency situation.
						Draupadi ko chandan ghisna pada - that was circumstantial.
						She didn't commit suicide that can't tolerate that.
						Engineer forced to be driver so what's the use of life.
						Education makes ppl frozen; can't be flexible.
						Vidura's argument was she is not lost cuz she is independent.
						Woman have their own personal rights not modern but vidura said.
							not for making them independent minded.
							many people misuse scriptures to present their ideas.
							That cow eating is mentioned in scriptures.
							Meat eating is there, yes that's true.
						Ramayan - Bharadvaj Rishi - some say this means he used to eat also that he arranged for them.
							Peacock, rabbits and hiran was fed to the army - not initiated.
							if soldiers don't eat onion garlic then we gotta eat cow meat.
							We can't keep 1 varna that's not possible.
							Don't take out 1 verse and make narrative out of that.
							It's integrated that should be understood not 1 word taken outta context.
						Bhishma said - dharma is complex but you are still asking about dharma I appreciate.
							she didn't need appreciation card at that time.
							But answers which Vidura gave.
							Bhishma is more important that he is mahabhagavat but by not answering he become indirect reason for vastra haran.
							He said that wife in any situation belongs to husband - and this gave them hammer to perform misconduct.
							This triggered a QA session instead of invoking that it's wrong misconduct.
						Once 1 devotee fell in class during SB class
							1 approach is let SB continue - so fortunate to leave body in temple.
							Those not medically trained prayed and chanted mantras but medical people immediately helped.
							That's the meaning of maam anusmara yudhyascha.
							Bhishma dev wanted sanskitik conduct but that triggered a chain that led to disrobing.
							Never happened in parliament b4.
							Vidura gave her position
								without astitva, or position we can't have relationship.
								Such vidura so dear to Krishna.
		Lecture 2
			So dear nishkam KY outta love that Krishna remembers Vidura - Garvit nahi gauravanvit hue on hearing this.
			Some think of fact fiction, some idle itihas - old times with no relevance now.
				Rope seen as snake at night - practically speaking it makes you behave as if snake.
				1 serpetologist - 3 times bit - more effect garmi than rain than - outta anger - people die in all but mainly outta fear - heart failure.
				If hospitalized in time then can be saved.
				It's not fact, fiction that makes difference but impact - that's what mood of Vidura was.
				Balanced in speech - talked about action to Yudhisthir and destiny to Dhritarashtra.
				Vidura's speech in Draupadi vastra haran was most important.
			Burning alive conspiracy Vidura response
				vs Bhishma - ajnat vaas - so bhishma gave hint as puzzle and didn't tell lie - where there's opulence and eth necessary. That's why they attacked Virat.
				Vidura let them go to there but in mleccha language which only Yudhisthir understood gave a hint.
				How to stay safe and how to propagate that you died in their conspiracy.
				That would mean that pandavas won't be chased. Stay safe until it's right time.
				Also, anta kriya for someone without knowledge that they are alive increases their power.
			On poisoning of bhima - he said don't scold the child. Cuz that will increase his anger and he will next time try to poison other sons as well.
				he drank and got power of 10K elephants by Vidura's arrangement.
				He was biased to dharma and not pandavas.
				Gandhari had got envy although dharma parayan - 1-2 mistakes but big results of the mistake
				concentrated milk - peda like drinking 5 litres milk. water all removed - so lump of envy concentrated.
			Dhritarashtra asked who will be king after Yudhisthir - so illogical question as if he didn't know.
				farmers know seeing the sky that such rain and so use this crop - not stock market centered.
				Brahmins said that this boy will cause end of dynasty so better reject this child.
					how can you ask to kill the child.
				Bharat M sacrificed his own child for sake of the kingdom - my child is more important than country.
				what is country doing - no right to ask cuz what are you doing?
				Dhritarashtra - I hate Vidura for his blunt speech but I like his truth but so blunt truth he tells.
				Shastra is universally applicable if understood right but what to do changes as per TPC
					80s guy wants to be PM is attached but Teen says vairagya then aalsi. Not how young he is.
					King can reject child for kingdom but a grihasta if he does then destroying tradition.
				How can Krishna marry so many and 5 pandavas against 1 wife - As much as you can digest simple answer.
				Vidura never stops speaking right things - many times rejected as mantri but can't do without him so recruited again.
				You are not getting sleep - then you must have cheated in gambling or set on fire someone or so forth. Vidura used to satire.
				Vidura used to try eth to set him on right path.
				Vidura tells who is foolish and who is intel - 5 types of ppl ew - even loka, etc.
					Some ppl love.
					Some envy.
					Some neutral. Walk by you.
					You will serve.
					Some will serve you.
			Vidur Neeti
				Sukh kya hai - Nirogi rehna first sukh.
					1 sick said medicine comes out as it is.
					daridrata of money, rogi, relationship - mind in bhajan doesn't happen - not even stable.
					Vidura - is mahatma, mahajan but he said what's sukhi.
				Yudhisthir on happiness - our own home, doesn't have to travel for work, koi rin nahi ho.
					Prominent rins - Rishi, Pitri, Dev, Bhuta.
					These rins are basically kritajnata symptoms.
					who stays far away he unhappy and his relatives also so our purvaj used to say never cross the ocean.
					modern education breaks the family.
					sharira to be offered to agni narayan in 12 hours for antim sanskar - offering be fresh.
			Vidur's facts - mother not mentioned but wife mentioned
				MB has no mention of Vidura's mother - such an important char but no mention.
				interesting fact Vidura's wife was Devaki's step sister. Devak's marriage with a sudrani.
			Vidura's departure - Yudhisthir wanted to meet Vidura
				He saw it from distance - very thin eating nothing.
				Ran away on seeing him - soul entered yudhisthir's body.
				agni sanskar mat karo aakashwani - his life as per dharma - brahma sakshatkar for him.
				Otherwise until body disintegrates can't get another body. So, some sanyasis say burn my body.
			Vidura to ?Yudhisthir
				Animals sense vibrations
					elephants group outside when a person dying; he used to serve them.
					go sevak when leaving body all cows tears and fasting.
					Cow used to eat medicines for the person who nurtured.
				Relationship can't be replaced.
					I can be his acting parent but the thing is that you are not.
				Fearless - adventure sport it has become.
					sukh and dukh combo keep coming.
				Pandit does not want flattery.
					And even ninda karna.
					Draupadi psychology that she observed they didn't say anything but had tears in their eyes.
						Seeing good in e1.
					But still they did not help cuz they were having conflicting sukh.
					Only 4 people didn't cry - Duryodhan, Duhshasan, Shakuni and Karna
				We see externals and make idea
					why mother keeps chastising father for getting water while he is sick.
					He has to move as per doctor so I force him that way othewise his habit to not move would be fatal.
				Daridra but still anger then no help.
				Too much forgiveness leads to othe person thinking that this person is weak.
					if that's what is reqd should still do
					National enemies should definitely not be forgiven.
					to forgive gives power to weak and ornament for strong like Arjuna in BG Ch1 appreciated by SP.
					Chapter 1 is also qualification for Arjuna to hear BG.
				Paap results for person but effects for people around also.
					1 person does wrong - eg - Nathu Ram Godse killed Gandhi and all Brahmins in Maharashtra suffered agony of their house burnt and driven away, etc.
					Lots of politics also involved like 1984 riots.
					like 1 person runs away all family members are enquired.
					Divider crossed and car hits - is it last life karma - no, even in this life, karma of a person affects people around him.
					Cigrette smell - secondary smoking both smell and smoke both naturally taken.
			Vidura Niti given to ?Dhritarashtra
				Right but I can't change - angry but continued to try.
				These day more Dhritarashtra and fewer Vidura these days. And those guys don't even want to try.
				Used harsh words - breads thrown by Bhima you consume.
				no renunciation even after sons killed.
				svadharma and kamana aare not the same thing.
				Akrura, Vibhishan, Vidura are like modern devotees who gotta work in other camps.
					financially stable needed but mind to be purified.
					Vidura left - I will travel to purify myself and he didn't go to Krishna directly.
				SP used to ask devotees SVAF well being.
					about prasadam, financials, etc.
		</Vidura>
		<Bhima>
		Applications - internally gentle, externally strong that doesn't tolerate injustice.
		Bhima is weird character if not understood properly.
			Best understood by Draupadi who knew him while Dayadrath abducting.
			She was not scared but concerned.
			When he asked she tells - he is your death but let me tell more.
				He is educated, powerful, effective, does what others can't.
				Any injustice to him or his related - he doesn't forget. Forgive and forget is not his philosophy.
				Forgiven then that becomes breeding ground for his negative trait.
				He gives punishment and still not satisfied - wants to give more.
			Vidura unadulterated pure - still Bhisma, Arjuna for war vikar, yudhisthir for gambling.
				Duhshasan similarly unadulterated impure - worse than Duryodhan.
				Bhima said he would drink blood of Duhshasan - some naive commentators say that blood drinking common those days ignoring his belly twist.
				Nishpaap when done injustice extreme brutal he gets - that's bhima - innocent but brutal.
		Doesn't tolerate injustice
			which hand you used for Draupadi - he still trying to anger Bhima and not asking forgiveness.
				This one - that was plucked out.
				Is that anyone to stop me from tearing his chest - he does and drinks blood.
				Said never tasted anything better - tastes better than mother's milk.
				No1 came close to him - people fainted.
				We sit in AC and give judgments but his agony was finally relieved.
			Bhima told yudhisthir that we can do 13 years exile by sankalpa like chaturmas and antim sanskar if no body.
				yudhisthir said don't do it - my maths is maths not imagination.
			but Bhima also ready to forgive if yudhisthir condition agreed but they didn't.
				Bhima said I don't want kuru dynasty to be destroyed.
				Krishna said fear that war is coming closer - never angry against Krishna but here.
				How can you even say that about me - I am never afraid. I was just testing if you were the same Bhima.
				So, he was a devotee soft heart.
				He was agitated against Krishna but didn't change his attitude.
				If war avoided then ultimate shreya but if it happens, I will do the needful.
		Bhima also has a soft side
			Bhima was like Narsimha angry even after killing Hiranya.
			But cried like child seeing Draupadi's hands while in cognito.
		Bhima asked what was most important to you.
			Can't lose my self respect even if gotta lose life multiple times.
			Warrior never shirks from death like Sanyasi.
		Bhima angry against yudhisthir - Arjuna, bring fire - I will set yudhisthir's hands on fire.
			Stri like jyoti or agni also can finish it off.
			Not Draupadi's fault - those who defile woman but those who do - their responsibility and social responsibility.
			Karna while they were leaving - saved by the wife.
		Bhima's terror that BG Ch 1 Duryodhan mentions we are insufficient in comparison to Bhima's protection.
			MB whole responsibility was on him.
			Dharma will stay on coffee table until sth is done.
			Dharma is like INR - works only if 7 accepts that currency so power is required for dharma.
			Dharma needs power so invoke vayu and it should grow.
			Indra invoked also for power.
			Satyamev Jayate - happens only when power stands with satya else we have MB as history.
			Kunti did tapasya for 1 year for every child but thru mantra it could be instant also but sankalpa is important.
		Bhima when born when fell on rock broke the rock as an infant.
		Krishna shows Bhima to Dhritarashtra.
			Kripacharya who used to fight on Kaurava behalf and stop as first defense but made as kulguru later after winning.
			Krishna sensed huge anger and can do anything.
			He powdered the statue for gada practice so much power.
			Bhima used to keep distance after that.
		Veer Gati so some money for some respect but eventually they are even worshipped like temples.
			People's dharana goes wrong and can spoil the nation.
			Bhima reminded - personal wealth you can give for shraddha of kauravas but not from govt public wealth.
		Bhima more powerful than Arjuna - he went to demigods for power but Bhima depended on Krishna.
			Arjuna's nature dovetailing e1 in Krishna's service is also a good attitude.
		Bhima is rapid fire - takes quick decision.
			disgusting action can be opportunity if properly done.
			Bhima's consumption of poison helped him.
			Amrita caused Rahu's death but poison made Bhima powerful.
			That's the nature of the world
			Arjuna tells yudhisthir - every positive has an negative inside and vv (yin and yang)
		Yudhisthir vs Drona - Bhima fills the gap
			yudhisthir compared to Gandhi many a times but yudhisthir knew politics properly.
			After pranam, asked all dignified ppl how they could be killed and Drona tells the secret that bad news.
			So gotta be very alert Krishna also heard it - don't miss.
			SP made false certificate of ear problem to sit in the front.
			SP - did I use simple way or complex way for KC presentation.
				SP revealed no with simple approach you would not come.
			So called adarshvad, Pandavas should not do it. Hanuman should not have done it.
				1 lady refused to sit in Uber with that picture of angry Hanuman.
			Hanuman's innocense of full in sindur - nishpaap but set lanka to fire is unauthentic source some ppl correct Valmiki himself.
			Arjuna so attached to Drona that no we can't do that to Drona but Bhima welcomed.
				Arjuna killed Bhishma 2 days back but saying that cuz of attachment for guru.
			Presenting concept in Twitter and doing it actually is different.
				Story of 3 frogs on tank - 1 thought to jump from tank; How many frogs on tank - not 2 - 3 only cuz he didn't do it only thought.
			Actually Yudhisthir's words also didn't take much effect - he was depressed but fought and demigods said.
				Bhima started to chastise with word arrows.
				Yudhisthir very angry but Bhima had to do it.
				Krishna only suggests; it's our responsibility to do it.
				Dhrishtadyumna killed him for which he had taken birth.
				Arjuna running towards saying that he has renounced weapons don't kill.
				Arjuna angry against Yudhisthir for doing it.
				Bhima reprimands him saying that you as kshatriya can't take favor of Drona.
					If we say all are good - Pak, China, Left, Naxalism, terrorism, Jehad all good then you will become invisible.
					Brahmin can do it but not kshatriya. Forgive simple people not people like him.
		Ashvatthama fired Narayan Astra means that it powered even other weapons and can't oppose it.
			Krishna told the solution - eth has solution - e1 renounce the weapons and even the willingness to fight.
			E1 did but not Bhima - Krishna didn't ask him to leave kshatriya dharma to become Ashok.
			That's also a political tactic or warfare tactic so not wrong for kshatriya.
			Arjuna temporarily used varun astra against Bhima and he was forced to bend down manhandled.
			Duryodhan laughed - see them in wartime and asked to Ashvatthama to fire again but not possible only once.
			Not every war can be won with weapons - we need other things also like political understanding and even humility.
			Eg - Aurangzeb asked to surrender forts and son to become subedar - kings agreed.
				He gave 23 forts taking inspiration from MB.
			Humility is not a substitute for Krishna - it is a means only.
				it's upakaran not upasana. SP said humility is worshippable.
				If humble no matter what then he will become shanda.
		Draupadi good qualities reprimands but always respects. Similarly Bhima.
			Yudhisthir not willing to fight. Bhima says you are surely not impotent so you must be a Brahmin in this form.
			Yudhisthir had this conflict of moksha marg or kama and artha. But forgot that rajrishi balances all of them.
			kaam is result of previous karma so always kaam in alignment with dharma and artha else it will all finish. Same with moksha.
			Kauravas didn't give money for rajsuya yajna thinking that our family only.
			Yudhisthir explains that I went their to usurp their kingdom.
				Problem was the I didn't know the maya of shakuni.
			All elders are sold to kaurvas and you can't fight with them without breaking that shield.
			Pandavas great not that they didn't fight but agreed with mutual respect.
			Not deny reality and that they had no debate and manthan gives vish then amrita - courage to discuss and stay relationship sweet.
			Arjuna however was confident that elders would be neutral. But BG chapter 1 shocks Arjuna that they were not neutral.
			We will fight cuz in cognito is impossible and we will stay for another 13 years.
			Virat phase all of them strived to earn including Draupadi, not saying that ladies should not work.
				Bhima used to sell; Draupadi used to get gifts; Brihannala also.
		Keechak mad after Draupadi.
			All will be made servants - bargaining and alluring.
			Prays to sun for purity. holds hand - impurity of glance, words, touch.
			Yudhisthir as kank gambling with virat.
			Keechak hits draupadi on chest and head - bleeding.
			Keechak had parallel govt so virat fearful.
			Virat said I don't know what happened in private so can't give justice.
			Somehow keechak kicked away by rakshas so problem solved for that time.
			Bhima came running with kitchen wooden rod - Kank indicated with words that this wood is fresh and green, for your purpose you will need dry wood from forest.
				Indication that you should kill him in far distance in forests but not here else we will be exposed.
			Draupadi comes to sleeping bhima and says you lying here like dead - what happened - that which should happen to Yudhisthir's wife.
				You have become entertainment for women here - kill elephant, tigers, etc.
			Arjuna in female form, kank again gambling.
			Saving your vrat and your wife will be gone - then Draupadi shows hands.
			People suicide over stocks down, status affected, etc but imagine what they had to go thru.
			Bhima said I will not even ask Yudhisthir - tell him to come to rang manch
			For Draupadi, so pure, even to say this was too much. She dared.
				She said even your husbands won't either understand even if they do, I will kill them.
			Yoddha both one for justice and another for bhoga.
			could not tell the sound of Bhima but on touch came to senses although drunk.
			Don't kill Arjuna reminded - you are fool to remind me so insulted. Really bet him blue.
				Bhima so angry that Yudhisthir doesn't know and no need to let Yudhisthir no also.
				Makes football out of that - hand put inside, leg inside and head inside.
			Indian ethos is sadgun so much that even forgive dushkriti and suffer cuz of that.
				If life imprisonment, then can abduct politician's child and free that person.
				Arjuna lost Abhimanyu cuz Jaydrath was saved.
			E1 understood that this is clear cut killing style of Bhima.
			Keechak younger brothers wanted to kill sairendri with his body cuz he loved her.
				Bhima with 10 vyoma tree width crushed them under the tree.
			Bhima ka smaran karke - all sins are destroyed.
		Bhima Meets Hanuman - not just tail but far more.
			Vana Prastha for pandavas but not the mentality of that.
			Living with rishis meant no politics, difficult to come back.
			So Krishna recommended that stay pure but cultivate power - keep changing home and cultivate weapons.
			Changing homes in forest - why?
				1. learn from different rishis
				2. 60K vidyarthi for 1 rishi and so keep moving else they will become cities.
				Shastra talks not just spiritual but also material guidance.
				Forest can grow on its own - so leave the place - Chitrakoot people say 10 years but Valmiki says 10 months.
				Indian not sensitive enough that milk on God and plastic on earth's lap.
				Virappan area so dense cuz no1 dared to enter - so wild animals are necessary to safeguard the forests.
			Pilgrimage 12 lakh people for badrinath, amarnath etc - so gotta be sensitive.
				Jhopdi - no area; all land mafia. So, Vrindavan also city now gonna become.
			Draupadi wants to gift flowers to Yudhisthir so asks Bhima to fetch them.
				Ramayan description is descriptive and feminine - very endearing to females.
					sensitivity and niceness is talked more.
				MB has 3-D characters but putting colors is responsibility of reader.
					Bhima said I never drank any so tasty no fruit juice etc.
				MB talks about Kesh pulling again and again but not vastra haran just once.
					Not cuz it didn't happen - we can write it indirectly but we really don't want to remember those scenes again.
					History also focuses on sensitivity and not just facts.
					when talking about breaking his thighs - it could be indirectly Vyasa dev saying that he was exhibiting his private part.
					Vyasadev can't write that.
				Sugriva forgot - Lakshman said Chaturmas over Vali vadh happened - change the noun, keep the verb.
				Vishnu Puran - Sudama and Krishna - 1 bird eating another bird - took shelter Krishna saved.
					Sandeepani M - who was right - not kill or punish the aggressor - both are right as per their varna.
					Show other face when slapped then face won't be left only.
				Bhima very angry and Hanuman thought that I need to make him sober.
			Bhaiya we are elder; don't disturb us.
				I am sick so should not go from here.
				I will go who can stop me - didn't say jump over - move it.
				that's aparadh - so kindly move it - I am very old plz do it yourself.
				Legs, hands, etc - humility kept on increasing - so curiosity increased.
				Respect comes and then comes attention -> Retention -> production.
				80% engr not employable cuz not talented.
				Hanuman tells Ramayan to Bhima.
				You could do it all by yourself then Ravan not killed by you why - that would decrease Ram's fame.
					Sita - I can't sit on another person and Ravan forced so that's different.
					Sita could curse and so could Draupadi in Keechak but doing that would insult Rama or Pandavas.
					No refined society that ladies are employed for protection.
				BSS for temple inauguration - told to do first worship cuz BSS not around - he started and meanwhile he came
					so sorry that didn't want to show his face.
					clarified with him - he said right principle that one should not try to supercede guru but your mood was of service alone so ok.
				Shakuntala told by Dushyant that you have done avajna but not adharma.
					prema vivah in scriptures but not without seeking blessings of parents.
					Kali yuga however - even without permission they would do it and parents even if it's dharma based won't approve it.
				Bhima shamelessly asks elder brother to show gigantic angry form that burnt lanka.
					Hanuman said should not ask such things - with change of yug eth changes.
					so ppl ask where Ram's forts, etc.
					Heights, biological diversity, etc - eth changes.
					Mumbai was not even there so Shivaji never came here - Pune was the limit.
					Even people claim that Ram's hermitage etc - time vanishes everything - only rivers, mountains may remain.
					St not even that - sarasvati gone - names change.
					Ppl say no sarasvati same can happen for ganga also.
					Still shows nevertheless.
				Tell me about 4 yugas.
					no kraya vikraya - devata rakshasa not much bhed. Hiranya only once in a while.
					Kali's effect all deities became black - didn't understand this.
					Kali stands on 1 shaking leg of bull.
				Blessings - Bhima's voice would be amplified by his sound.
					I will be on the flag.
					Even speaking is important. One with scream has power.
					Cursing words not these days but power diminishing psychologically.
					Communists targetted Bangal and Kerala - small literature and pamplet.
					Wrong things spoken for long, consistently, huge numbers and eventually ruined the states.
					They are still ruled by leftist ideology.
					Consciously blaspheme scriptures. All abuses hierarchically - even parent and child.
					Such books should be avoided - without proper tark vitark we would emotionally get swayed.
		Bhima felt bad killing only Vikarna others he killed all kauravas.
			Vikarna gave good argument cuz she is wife of others also.
			Karna snubbed him down.
		Bhima had tolerate for lifetime for Duryodhan so killed and stepped on his head Balaram angry and Krishna solaced.
			Balaram is teaching something although he was neutral he sided bad side.
				Most of the neutral people side with bad people - everytime you will see.
				yes critical thinking is good but putting extra weight on other side is not.
				Britishers coming to india can be studied critically without bias condemning your own civilization is taking things far.
				They start sympathizing with invaders - oh we got train cuz of them, we got clothes, shayari, etc.
				giving more importance where it is not required.
			Balaram argued with Krishna.
				what wrong - he is our family so good for family.
				Kali is like that.
				Bhima had taken a vow so Duryodhan had to remember.
			You are arguing unnecessarily I am not convinced.
				Angrily went to Dwaraka but didn't punish Bhima.
		Charvak came to Pandavas with chastisement - leftist style.
			Angry and started chastising.
			Brahmins in the assembly understood he just wanted to create confusion for the future appointed by Duryodhan party.
			Krishna even takes them to Parents to ask for apology.
			Gandhari wanted to curse but was holding - nail turned black cuz of a glance below patti.
			Stopped by Vyas.
			How could you drink brother's blood - I didn't I just touched it with my teeth cuz of vow.
			1 drop or 1 glass - anyways the vow was fulfilled.
			But all anger came to Krishna and cursed him - your dynasty will be destroyed.
			Other angry and Krishna smiled - I was anyways thinking what to do with them. And thanks, now you won't curse pandavas.
			Most love was expressed by Yudhisthir and Draupadi but Krishna exceeded in his love the most.
			Krishna said to Daruka - Arjuna's vow will be fulfilled else I will take to chariot and the battle will see e1 finished off.
			So mouldable for Krishna they were that ready to be female, cooks, etc.
		</Bhima>
		<Dhritarashtra>
			Applications - dangers of weak heartedness caused by self obsession; justifications in daiva.
			In 1 sense we have no right to speak about them but all these characters are in us.
				Symbolic in us.
				Gandhari - why did this to me. Bhishma good character but seed implanted contrary. Karna always self esteem.
				Dhritarashtra jumping for me and mine.
				MB is about what's happening now.
				MB is about fairness in material realm and SB about spiritual.
				Niceness is deceptive but fairness is stats - it's gross in front of all.
				Not imagination to float in. MB sounds tough, challenging but Ramayan is st poetic so much time over forest description.
				In disorder, spirituality is not possible. Eg - Gandhari curses Krishna.
			Anger beneath the pain
				No matter the past the pain is genuine so condolence after all kauravas.
				E1 saw pain but Krishna saw anger behind the pain so put bhima idol in front.
				Freedom from all faults is not possible for jivas but only Krishna.
					Jiva can only bring it out only.
				Me and mine is first thing every child speaks but is it narrow or broad - how encompassing is your me and mine.
				Janak says my Sita and country - affection not ownership and willingness to protect.
			Ancestors
				Dushyant sons if made king will destroy themselves and others so 7 adopted made king.
					Rashtra for me vs me for Rashtra.
					Later, Dhritarashtra - looking for sympathy not solution.
					Hopelessly depressed ego was characteristic of dhritarashtra.
					Suffering and emergencies are part of life - good and bad coming to life is natural.
				Shantanu precarious situations - You never question me from Ganga is marrying a boss - won't last.
					Tolerated it 7 times or minimum 7 years.
					You are tolerating something unreasonable.
					Patience is a journey but not a destination - frustrating in itself eventually.
					Bhishma is made to feel like you happened to us but not desired.
					Arranged father's marriage and unreasonable marriage condition.
					Both sons died - cause being name problem and too much sensuality.
					Purpose of vow - stability at that time but instability causing henceforth.
					Facility of emergency seed - so amba and ambalika can procreate.
			Dhritarashtra self obsession
				consciousness of undesirable and unexpected.
				why should he suffer for blame of mother - invoke child matching mother's consciousness.
				Laws of nature so precise that nothing happens by accident.
				Give resources to those not qualified then more nasty.
					Unwanted child + Sympathy without empowerment = Dark Future.
					Disliked by others, but you like yourself => Obsessions for self.
					Camera once in a while - developing positive takes time but now culture of self obsession with selfies.
					Indian culture of mourning for 13 days after death - time to reflect on the contributions of a person.
						you don't settle down with mourning - contributions of a person and express connection and gratitude.
						Lasting impact for rest of our life.
						Even we as ISKCON celibates make this mistake 1 celibate died and e1 busy preaching and spreading but no settle down with it.
				self obsession so could not renounce Duryodhan at birth.
			Dhritarashtra talks daiva - whenever it comes to changing in favor of pandavas.
				Daiva is original potential - taking action within capacity (Purushartha) makes it complete.
				Daiva never accepted - abondon sin (Duryodhan), He can never be king himself, None of his sons will ever be king, 2nd position.
				Endeavors for kingship / position - Destroying Pandavas
				Misuse of both daiva and purushartha.
					Born blind but in royal family.
					Dharma centric purushartha gives clarity of where to plce emphasis.
					he constantly fought againt his blindness.
					Thus rich st suffer more than poor - poor don't suffer psychiatrist consultation.
					when wrong happened he said daiva and right indication he fought against.
				He fought for position instead of focuing on self growth.
				Daiva then where is growth - grow is different from acquiring position.
					purushartha is in your hands - to be doctor is daiva but specific college is interference in daiva.
					To be politician is ok but to be PM is not ok.
					Not position but what we become is in our control.
				Kunti said Pandavas are not meant for happy personal life or settled life but live a responsible life.
					conflict of duality was little in forest but much more in hastinapur - denying their existence as Pandu's sons.
					Time spent not just lamenting - that also cuz that's being human but also cultivating resources.
				Fate - Daiva, Dista (allotment, fate), kala, vidhi, dhatr or vidhatra, bhagya, bhagadeya (share, portion, lot, fate)
					Markandeya - King! some things come as fate, chance, previous action so don't think anymore.
					Sanjay states them and also some by God
					Mahatma Gandhi - BG and MB disconnected - book of war and philosophy so don't mix.
					Krishna to Uttanka - Yes, I am soul of soul yet I act as I am born - gandharva, God or human. I don't interfere but counsel.
					superficial understanding of God consciousness is you say take care of me and he does.
					Best marketing some say is giving them commodity of God and do nothing and they act as you like.
					1 child abuse in boston newspaper - I could never come out of conflicting situation of genuine affection and also exploitation.
						I can't still say I hate him. Although his exploitation far exceeded his affection but could not ignore that.
						Love can give self empowerment but same dependence makes child lose identity.
			Weak or wicked
				He used weakness as a tool to be wicked.
				Dhritarashtra - I am gratified by 3 fire like children of the firewood Kunti. He knew his destruction is bound to happen.
				3 components in MB
					Dhvani - Suggestion, Meaning without saying.
					Sahrdaya - Sensitive reader or spectator.
						read beyond the verses of MB.
						Some talk verses; some imagine.
						Psychologists - use words to detect personality.
							Eg - I quickly reached office - why he said quickly. That tells sth about him.
							So be conscious.
						Eg - BG 1st verse - SP tells his duality and narrow mindedness.
					Rasa - Flavor, Emotions.
				Gandhari saw Draupadi as her destruction.
				Why BG presents soul while on battlefield
					soul remains even if you die so act Arjuna.
					Many use the same chapter for vairagya.
					Engage in work - cuz life is short.
				Vishishta tells everything is illusion - relationships, etc - svadharma is only important.
					So different philosophy but giving same conclusion of svadharma.
				Dronacarya taught them skills alone.
					Most of MB characters had unpredictable lives - Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Gandhari born properly.
					Sanskars are not values - values are text books and marks centric.
					Listening without action is useless.
					Kanika tells - political adviser
						internally be so wicked kill own relatives if necessary
						but externally but sweetest - cry the most when sth bad happens.
					More Dhritarashtra in every home; we need more Vidura in every homes.
				MB important at present - absorb spiritually, alert politically, sensitive socially.
					Dhritarashtra got spiritual perfection but at the cost of havoc that should not be ignored.
				Dhritarashtra had prajna chakshu - insight to predict what's gonna happen.
					lesser mistakes if you have it.
					problem here with insight and action not aligned.
					Why Arjuna behaved that way in BG chapter 1 - Dhritarashtra sent message to pandavas in Virat that you have stayed good and pious life, stay that way.
					What's the psychology behind that - don't plot against us and that's what you are - don't change that. Making them act certain way.
					underlying essence that what others do to you is their problem but you should not do it to them.
					Arjuna ready to beg also in BG1.
					Begging is allowed in Shastra - but only Brahmins - not outta humility but to avoid life of dependence.
					Else high command whatever he says he has to do. Ideology not pressed upon you.
					Independent at presenting thoughts to the people.
					Palaces not grand - Krishna Devaraya palace nowhere to be found cuz temple is the center.
					Similarly, Shivaji 350 forts but no palace - kings to be gratifying senses and desensitized to society.
					Introduced cricked - royals involved in ranji trophy and that's the first sign of slavery.
				Gandhi's letter to Louis Pasteur - In Italy, you don't retaliate but don't sell your soul. Practice non-violence.
					Response - it is too idealistic - your suggestion is one of dying not living.
					Individually may be ok but not politically - Yudhisthir was politically astute - strategy to kill on battle.
				Gambling he was asking - what's the status update.
				I have attempted 40% paper - praying to Ganesh to pass me in exam.
					until the examiner is lazy and crazy, there is no hope.
					And if that happens, it will only increase our inefficiency in the future.
					No scripture allows this - daiva indpendent of purushartha and vv never happens.
					The law of nature is fire burns - no change with that. Civilization is not waiting for God to change that.
				Draupadi calls Krishna as friend and he accepts.
					I am marrying - Draupadi until she agrees how can that happen.
					Declaring is ok but Draupadi plays the part of friend then Krishna accepts.
					Stand in line for IPL - Indians at present are controlled by Dhritarashtra consciousness - My purushartha for IPL but daiva for temple.
					You can't beat Pandavas - from forest to come and win.
					Expect miracles then nightmares. Live life s.t you experience miracles.
					Draupadi had children killed but didn't say why this happened to me - justice needs price.
			After the event
				Victim of suffering.
				The agent of suffering.
				Passive witness to suffering
				Advisor against grief.
				He is the cause of the events and the consequences of the events.
				Agent and victim of suffering are the same.
				Who suffered the most in MB - Dhritarashtra. Who caused it - Dhritarashtra.
				sympathies are like drugs - always looking for crutch.
				Yes Draupadi also suffers but it serves as a sacrifice - suffering become worth it.
				#Shap - When a person has spent sth for several years - they say sth positively or express pain, it works.
					unlimited energies in the world.
					Yudhisthir tells to Virat that Brihannala must have managed - hit with dice.
						blood comes out and Draupadi collects and says if blood spills on ground it will destroy you dynasty.
						Where are pandavas - the place which is prospering and happiness around, there they are.
			Responsibility
				Dhritarashtra - No hope for him when Arjuna pierced fish, etc.
					he knew it but acting against daiva.
				Kali yuga is those at the highest level are controlled by those at lowest level - degree holders under barely passing fellows became politicians.
					Kali yuga won't change but we gotta change our consciousness.
					1 rebel in some country said - I don't care if govt listens to me but that I don't want to listen to them.
						he said they have no right to change me.
					submitting to kali means becoming agent of kali.
					No scriptures expect you to be perfect complete human being. that's not possible.
				Rice can make bisibele bath, rice, pulav, Biryani, liquor, chakli but flaw is not of rice but one who makes sth with that rice.
				Teacher can teach but learning is my responsibility. Mother can cook but eating is child's responsibility - can escape home.
					Prahlad could justify that what else than to become a demon.
				Lamentation of Dhritarashtra is not reflective one but one of caught after cheating.
					Caught after exam cheating - you confesss cuz you are caught not cuz you cheated.
			Looking for justification to continue - 3 perspectives on suffering of Dhritarashtra.
				Such people to counsel you b4 or after a mistake. Literary incarnation and father.
				Sanjay - Individual problem - don't lament cuz you are cause and effect.
					trying to make bridge after water flown away; so many said what to do but you did.
				Vidura - path of generalized suffering. Life is so designed that matra sparshas tu kaunteya - dualities for all.
					hapus or rajapuri - mangoes are not all sweet. Good and bad and hope for future.
					Dualities so perfect in world that - In hopelessness you find ray of hope and In great prosperity you feel a pinch of salt.
					BG is not this or that but this and that - while chapter 18, chapter 2 also applies.
					Vijaynagar 1565 - empire of 250 years - 1 Million gold coin ed.
					Monday he was king and tuesday empire fall started.
					British said sun never sets but now it never rises.
					tells story of licking honey while on branch about to break in well and bees biting.
				Vyasa
					He saw almost on the verge suicide - die with body but subtle body remains - so illogical.
					Unlimited negativity is all that remains.
					Happens - jiva, nature and higher dimension daiva (god and demigods)
				They gave rice, milk and sugar - he made liquor, tea with it once more.
			He sat on kings chair for 18 more years.
				Beware of teacher that makes you live in world but not grow in the world.
				If teacher does not chastise you, then you don't have a teacher.
				Unfortunately, we think pampering equals love but that's wrong understanding.
				You can't sleep comfortably at night cuz you know your dark side.
				SP - Lie spoken for a long time, large number of people, louder - lie only but will be taken as truth.
				Vidura gave heavy talk - taking thrown pieces of Bhima.
				Gandhari and Kunti - all left together. Scripturally also right - Kunti went to accompany enlightenment.
				Fire was forest fire - not sati like fire. Kunti goes inside seeing agni narayan.
					Death does not define destination but thought process and how life was lived.
					SP - Dhritarashtra did not attain perfection.
					Some jews write that they died dignity praying to God nothing to look up to but those inflicting were full of guilt.
					person died but personality remains in other people.
				I own eth become I own nothing.
		</Dhritarashtra>
		<Duryodhan>
		Applications - ?All these characters represent our internal tendencies so we can ponder and try to work on ourselves to not become like them in Identity.
			of course, some positives can be taken from villain characters also in sincere case studies but with caution.
		Duryodhan - Summit of Arrogance
			Meaning - one who is difficult to conquer in battle.
				Odhana - 1 who can fight with valor.
				St people think that negative names but that's not true.
				Duhshasan means - difficult to overcome his governance.
			BG 1 - lamentation of Dhritarashtra, then Duryodhan, then Arjuna.
				Application - divine, demoniac or confused - all gotta experience their set of dualities.
				He could not share his feelings with anyone.
				7 and 11 akshauni is not just 7:11 - we are talking numbers of millions so huge gap literally.
				Narayani sena - every gopa was as powerful as Krishna but under him.
				I will not kill pandavas - then why fight you are not in for talent show.
				MB never talks about Duryodhan's knowledge of Kunti and Karna relation.
					Karna was not asked about saving 4 children.
				His dilemma was all the 3 generals made clear they won't kill pandavas then what's the point of fighting battle.
					tough that don't cry cuz can't release the pain.
				Arjuna heard BG but it did not happen immediately implementation - reflection and talking take time to assimilate.
			Was he original pappu or qualified.
				Application - demoniac can also be very qualified cuz of tapa. KC means tapa under him.
				very qualified - great focus and concentration - favorite of Balram.
				Taking shelter of Krishna makes to alert not passive - not burden Krishna but shoulder.
				Don't fight dying warrior cuz nothing to lose. That's why don't take him light in the end also.
				You don't become clean by HN until you brush your teeth. You may have a devotee driver but he has to really know driving.
				Actual devotee does not try cooking for Krishna directly but first make others as bali ka bakra.
				Duryodhan practised every day with maze vs coming from forest without practice so don't take him lightly.
				Goodness of Duryodhan is also described by Krishna.
				Similarly, Good about Vyasa is he displays even the good side of evil characters as it is.
			Gandhari got lump of flesh out when hit herself.
				Application - Birth samskars matter. Nipping in the bud is easy - later it is difficult for bud, tree and gardener.
				C-section can't be considered as birth time as per astrology one qualified astrologer said cuz that's interference with nature.
					won't tell that 1 to 100 children thru cloning cuz people say blind following.
						blind following whether sanskrit text or science based is to be called blind.
						sound ignorant of hindi makes you progressive - how weird is that.
						You don't know MB, etc makes you seem so progressive and liberal. That's breaking bad.
						And if you condemn then you are more intellectually advanced. What stupid logic is that.
					So, it's anyways not the point of MB so can be ignored but was like that.
				Birth samskaras stemmed from Gandhari's envy - grew into big tree of envy.
					spoilt not by lack of love or attention but too much of it.
						can't force child to anything - even a devotee - kuchh suna do badal jayega - won't work that way.
						willful engaing discussion makes a difference.
					Bhima and Duryodhan both born on same day and nakshatra but very different.
					Had good qualities but bad consumed them.
						Not only vow of bhima but Maitreya also cursed him cuz ignoring and shaking his thighs but if you change you won't.
					Had determination but it slowly and eventually turned into stubbornness.
						maze fighting ed. Competence but character was 0.
						He buys Bhishma, Drona. He procures Krishna's army.
						Yes pandavas and Krishna were related as cousins but Duryodhan's daughter married to Krishna's son very close.
						Brahmastra had a condition - 4 lakh gayatris only then.
							Brahma said all intel you have and brain burst.
					vs Pandavas - Pandu told the sequence.
						first dharma but to uphold it we need strength.
						gotta have DAKM - so artha be with Dharma.
						Some villagers complain - good philosophy - first water not there to bath or wash.
				Identity Crisis - how did he identify himself.
					his identity was established by comparing himself with pandavas so gave rise to envy.
					envy connected to a royal family with unlimited resources => Arrogance.
					Envy + Arrogance => Feeling threatened and violent.
					Threat of Arjuna's archery and Yudhisthir's ruling power => wanted to destroy.
					Hankdered for more honor than befitting his age, position, power.
					So, Envy --> Arrogance --> Threatened and violent --> Destruction.
					envy - envied and envying both suffer. Like India vs China - losing face to the world and resources.
			Legit questions
				Gandhari's legit child and eldest son's child although blind.
				Here's the mistake of Indian morarchial system to be birth centric - it was not.
				Eg - Dushyan M and so many times it was adopted.
				Why Jhansi ki rani fought against them cuz it was her right to place adopted child on throne.
					that was questioned by britishers which was happening for 1000s of years.
				Chanakya - Next king should be born from royal family and good character.
					but if you are not able to find royal with good character then search someone else who has good character.
				That's why Ram didn't object Bharat to be the king - he is not the eldest.
					cuz qualified and no such rules that eldest be the king.
				?The problem that e1 knows Duryodhan's lack of character but weakness of heart won't allow that. Like with our life also - know it right or wrong but weakness.
			Wanted to destroy their talents, power, them, their wealth.
				Greed is sin of capitalism and envy is the sin of socialism.
					disparity of resources vs sharing of poverty.
					Nowhere close to VA - cooperative life.
					Socialism is so dangerous - e1 become equal for everything.
					Even voting rights - vote can be bought with a liquor - drum filled on the way to election.
					Chanakya - Policies should be made by those who are affected not the ones who got nothing to do with them.
						king is a law keeper not law maker - law is refined between policy maker (affected people) and ministers back and forth n times.
						To consult etc is the way to go - even water harvesting - tech driven, sensitively understanding earth and sustainable.
					E1 saying I will eat 3 paranthas - Punjabi can digest but not Kerala communist.
				Poison, Burning, taking honor and confidence in public place => mental slavery.
					Wanted them to dissent but failed cuz Pandavas were guided properly - ?how power schemer and politician as well as warrior he was. How formidable but dharma protected pandavas.
				REL we start glorifying those who raped the nation
					public place saying if there were no mughals then no tandoori.
					No railway without britishers.
					Say whatever you want but at least balance it with atrocities they did.
					That's my identity - accidently I am born here - I feel more american or european than Indian.
					You could be defeated but not destroyed country. Broken person but not finished person.
					1 officer justifying his suicide with Ram, Lakshman, Jnanadev, Jainis - these facts can't be denied but see how he is misusing them.
						This is nothing but arrogance of the officer that I know eth or whole of India and have right to give judgment.
					Bharat wanted to stop eating - Ram said it was sin to do this in youth.
			Duryodhan gift collection dept - opportunity to learn appreciation or suffer the envy.
				Krishna took service of washing feet - you don't know arrogance of sages.
					They may curse the sacrifice if displeased and also get to serve.
					self righteous life so can be proud.
					demigods in prayers - some cross ocean of lust but fall under ocean of anger.
					st politicians exhibit humility st.
				I am burning the fever - fever of envy.
					I have given you so much.
					If dissatisfied, then we grow.
		L2
			Social - gotta feed my seva vritti instead of layered BV although that's also important.
				Problems is not out there - it's with us.
				Villains rule cuz heroes are silent.
				You can't be a guide like SM, counselor in sick state as NOI1 says but you have right to do value adds with right statements.
					SP - If you know Krishna is SPOG, tell that.
					Another M - Even if I am not practicing I should still them and hence me what's right.
			Duryodhan
				Application - We all have these tendencies in us - we should not water them.
				Just discard this son and whole kuru clan will be saved.
					Devs - 8 dead bodies could not sleep.
					1997 - bus crashed - Ganesh celebs with liquor
					1 person died in lap and could not sleep for nights.
					Imagine the episode to see 1000s of people die in MB.
					1 crime and consequence is multiple.
					For family, it may be normal but for royal family the consequence is huge.
				French queen - no brain to say that no bread so eat cake.
					so desensitized she had become.
					Taking pleasure in other's suffering.
					Harsh speech, violence.
					Duryodhan exhibited these qualities.
					Slaughterhouse - mindful to not cut their little finger - but see no connection cuz desensitized.
					No brutal - it's ideology and attitude of Duryodhan - we use abuse but not empower.
					Sports teacher neighbor won't let us study.
					Taking pleasure in suffering - narcissist - I trained them. Ready to lay down their life for me.
					Father said I got all his money from employment and give him allowance - unreasonable. Where is empowerment and trust.
				Duryodhan would threaten of suicide.
					So obstinate that gimme what I want else suicide. Let him die.
					Afzal guru is praised like Karna is praised.
					See pandavas tortured cuz take prosti to forest and enjoy their envy. narcissists.
					Calling bhima bull - subtle way of telling lacking discrimination.
					Perversions to appreciate Karna for saying that disrobing Draupadi was justified.
					That's why Kunti says asat sabha - less than vultures vs Jatayu who laid down life.
					Even actors in MB had tough time shooting this. Trauma to act - this is too much.
					So what mentality they had developed - unaware that you have become so nasty - nature of mind.
				Duryodhan could please people. Very smart, competent and talented.
					Managed to please Durvasa - who is famous for curses.
					Durvasa - You 2 will carry me - Rukmini drank water so cursed that no sweet water around.
					Durvasa - bhiksha dehi - not even asked if there is food; yudhisthir promised without checking but to save from curse.
					Conflict among Pandavas would guarantee our success.
					Karna once said that women like to enjoy with more men - so getting it religiously what else. Distorted mentality.
					Good to see good in bad people - but when you do that you end up making good guys villain - that's not nature of scriptures and will mislead.
				Illogical
					Arrogance - I know you have help of Vasudev, Gandhiva as big as tala tree and great warrior but will take away your kingdom.
					Hanuman claimed that all are equal or great than me and inducing fear of Ravan.
					Arjuna never wanted credit - BG 15 - I won battle cuz of Krishna.
					Virat yuddha - still a eunuch but defeated all the kauravas 4 times.
						Disrobed the upper cloth of all of them for uttara.
					Vidura described Duryodhan unqualified to hear him.
						given up dharma and artha.
						full of anger.
						Tries to destory honor of others and always looks for honor himself.
						Disregard words of teachers.
						Application - Respect => Attention => Retention => Reproduction.
							why do I not listen to them?
							Advance tax of 10 years from people - non governance based rule - not empowering but fear - brutal ruler.
								no service to cows or brahmins.
								Like North Korea.
					You can't tempt or buy Krishna
						Silk and facilities then he will be favorable
						but Krishna went to Vidura.
					Vidura describes Duryodhan
						doesn't respect shastra words.
						bhoga vritti; thinks himself intelligent.
						Betrays friends. Doubts e1. Does not do any welfare to ne1.
						doesn't ack good done by others.
						No steady resolve.
					Stallin was more than Hitler.
						when people trust me - shooting them.
						Maoism - Original Mao - his history - we should not even name him.
						All doctors won't return - cuz he didn't want others to know that he had a problem.
						Combodia - Ankur Vat - Pol Kot - farm lands - skulls of humans there.
						Idamin few decades back - human flesh in fridge.
						Afzal Khan - Dargah which hindus would visit. He said if I live I will get new ones.
							don't know how true the story is.
						Vidura had nothing against him - working for them.
					More eg.
						Refusal to give mere 5 villages.
							after enduring so much not even that.
							Go to Dwaraka cuz they won't change.
							No matter how bad but jiva still is sat cit ananda
								Ravan etc could change their will so Lord tried a lot like with Duryodhan also.
						Total lack of estimating skills.
							Karna was seen fleeing b4 but assures father of victory based on Karna's support.
							does not mention Drona, Bhishma, etc.
					Chanakya says some corruption that honey bottle will be licked is ok.
						but don't become so corrupt that it's noticeable.
				His stubbornness.
					2 calculations and as per both Pandavas had cleared - no I don't think so.
					Krishna shows vishva roop.
					Appointing a king while himself not a king.
					Overly dependent on emotional person like Karna. Eg - Capturing Drupada.
					Virata battle.
					Harsh tongue and behavior.
						After the 3rd day at war, seeing the great damage, spoke harshly with grandfather Bhishma.
						See the uprooting of our army and Karna unavailable cuz of you. why don't you die?
					Maitreya Rishi's curse.
				Caused unlimited violence
					Verbal - Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi.
					Political - Virata (wanting to compete with Yudhisthira), Vaishnava Yajna.
					Physical - Abhimanyu, Draupadi, Jayadratha - condemned by death, used him to kill Arjuna.
						Even Jayadratha wanted to flee still he would be saved but benediction of head on ground so sure shot kill of Arjuna here.
					Even karna - charity not with ambition.
						Charity until I kill Arjuna. It had a purpose.
						Charity not to convert people - temptation for spirituality - concept of bribery continues.
				Blamed others for his suffering
					How do you create narrative - history books - sympathize invaders for being misunderstood by local religious people.
					They broke temple and approval.
					Some blame Radha Govind temple - happened cuz of Shivaji M not Aurangzeb.
					This is a narrative - without Shivaji we won't even go to the temple but narrative is he was anti.
					Aurangzeb was not ordinary - almost a life of goswami.
						most austere. No enjoyment, entertainment. Shrewd politician. Power to control brothers and Rajputs also.
						Here small startup king is able to escape in Agra that's humiliation.
						This escape made Aurangzeb mad and hence started breaking temples in Kashi, Vrindavan, etc.
						This is as per many chronicles like Akbarnama, etc.
						Don't get upset by Shivaji - else that's Vaishnava aparadh - trained by Tukaram and Ramdas.
						We should congratulate and be greatful to our ancestors for surviving and struggled to maintain what.
							they could have converted but lived with the beliefs.
						He is the one who fought for gobrahmana culture. so, don't accept such narratives.
				Balaram was neutral party - you eventually side with negative party.
					He ready to attack Bhima when Duryodhan was attacked - could not be defeated while he was attentive exclaimed Arjuna and Krishna.
					Disparity is there - we are secularism at the expense of majority religion.
					What's logical - poverty, potential. But since ages this tradition exists.
					People will lose patience - can't take more than they can handle - that's history of creation - suicidal or brutally murderous people become.
				Duryodhan critizes Krishna for adharma and I am dharma always.
					communication skills convinced even demigods and showered flowers.
					Criminal has power to make good person criminal - power of narrative or story telling.
					Not only higher beings got mistaken.
					Even pandavas got disheartened what we have done - I enjoyed kingdom and only death of army you got.
					Without Krishna, pandavas would have been depressed.
					How powerful Duryodhan was at using communication.
					Charvaka - not philsophy guy but another that you have done very wrong.
					1 shetty slowly but surely we win - I used only manure and see my soil and plantation results.
					Nehru's mistake of Research and teaching separated - great connect together.
						gurukul system connected to also study finer aspects of teaching.
						gurukulis also would explore and practice while training new guys.
					Ramanujam - Vedas are in scriptures but also in nature (focus on aroh)
						?avaroh is studying vedas from ishwar and aaroh is studying vedas thru nature.
					Not just cruel but strategic - ability to make others criminal.
				Duryodhan's identity.
					He was papa purusha and Kali personified.
					We experience Kali scattered in times but concentrated form was Duryodhan.
					Shakuni was Dwapar - hypocrisy and Kali for quarrel.
					Where was chance of winning Gambling yudhisthir who represents satya yuga.
					On guidance of Krishna, he understood that he needs to add practicality to ideals.
					SP - non-violence is demonic for kshatriya.
					Parikshit had easy time - much better than Yudhisthir cuz former laid foundation.
					People question that kali anyways came - so that's the solution.
				QA -
					not miracles but endure suffering - where to draw line that I am over-endeavoring.
						Krishna's logic is best yukta ahar, yukta vihar, etc.
						When can't give time to health, family, you know you are over endeavoring.
						Krishna will take care then recreation too much.
						cuz of education system, when we come out we become more confused.
						Indians rush to western but 12% have personality disorder - this is huge number - don't take that lightly.
						How embarassed - 15 lakhs engr every year and 1 lakhs get job.
							Many people in IT don't know much. Pushed without being educated.
						Insincere get confused and sincere guys come out of education system with sincere confusions.
					This balance of purushartha and daiva - people say just pray to Narsimha and will be solved.
						yes, but first check if brakes are working or not.
						In our vehicle was also Narsimha dev was there and we had chanted Narsimha arati.
						Our negligence or their negligence but we suffer their negligence.
						Yudhisthir - Great people cheat for great cause - so yes we in spirituality also get cheated with good reason.
						As we grow, mercy is there but we have to grow.
						Your endeavor like lemon - king loved lemon and gave to king.
							So good lemon that got 2 villages as gift, 3 villagers discussed.
							The power of my lemon.
							Another said - no, king's magnanimity.
							3rd said - nothing would have come without a lemon tree.
							Our effort is lemon and villages is our gifts. There is no proportionate price that 2 lemons means 2 villages.
						Instead of ambitions of mother, followed himself.
							Picasso would have followed his mother to become soldier or priest - he would not be general.
								followed his own svadharma and became what he is.
							Chanakya - found Chandragupta. What will happen to my goats and sheeps.
								people are like goats and sheeps and he is meant to rule them.
								Don't stop the growth of this child.
						All questions of karma and mercy - shows misdirected education system.
							same mentality in spirituality - then 2 minutes noodles.
							No, it's not like that it takes lifetimes of sincere endeavor.
							It's a wrong expectation to say that I will go BTG after this life - be realistic.
							Discover yourself journey is like that - first we gotta realize how ignorant fool I am.
							That's beginning of knowledge and humility.
							False confidence in spirituality - I am far away for Krishna is not just poetry it's a fact also.
							Better to claim that I am stupid which is fact also.
							Speaking english is seen as sign of knowledge so much dust on head.
							BG heard by Arjuna but got to hit Bhishma the 10th day so remunerating.
								He was such a student won't sleep at night - not watching cricket match.
							In whole MB only 2 mentions of Kali Yuga - Markandeya Rishi and Hanuman to Bhima.
								Purpose was not to make them inactive but active - do dharma now.
							Drona represents concept of modern education will discuss that later.
					Q - Saying the Shivaji was misguided and frustrated person.
						Hindavi swaraj which is not KC.
						Devs not from Indian background may say this cuz they don't know historical things.
							less informed about historical things.
						SP - Let Indian things be handled by Indian people - they know their political environment, practicality, history, etc.
							1 dev criticizing Indira - shut up and do devotional service. Be sensitive to your surrounding.
						It's an aparadh - and I am not MH but Kannadiga.
						Krishna is available to eb - Krishna is to be seen in splendorous activities.
							better say that I don't know and talk to some Indian devotee.
		</Duryodhan>
		<Gandhari>
		Application - st we misuse our dharmik credits for wrong purpose.
		Gandhari
			Intro
				Application - even these names are high benchmarks - have power so not even named.
				Flags of personalities -
					Krishna's greatness.
					Kunti - forbearance of Kunti - limitless sufferings.
					Vidur - foresightedness or insight.
					Dharmik pandavas
					adharmik or evil kauravas.
					Dharmasheelata of Gandhari
				misuse of dharmik life is another thing.
				No1 names their child after these - why? None of these had stable lives.
					full of limitless life - name is so powerful that we can't handle.
					Arjuna got brahmastra after chanting 10 crores of gayatri mantras.
					Satyavati had children killed.
			Dhritarashtra heard wife's advice but never followed.
				Application - Good advice should immediately go into some scrum plan.
			Gandhari made beautiful house of dharma but destroyed it to ashes by cursing Krishna.
				Application - to err is human; e1 has regret at the end of life and should have cuz no1 is perfect
					don't paint anyone good or evil - both exist in world of duality even on dimensions like gender.
					accept real world grey dimensions cuz it's not about niceness but alignment to laws of nature.
					even tolerating negativity has a limit. So, we must express our humanness with sb.
				Vedic culture you remember mother along with God - it's not attachment but being cultured.
				When a person leaves the world he should have triangle - satisfaction, gratitude and regret.
					no regret means you are an animal only.
					Krishna's regret was not helping Draupadi at right time.
					What a good fortune of God regreting for you.
					Vidura also remembered by Krishna - Vidura broke out on hearing this - what is my qualification.
				wall of determination can't tolerate negativity for too long.
					Gandhari could never express her humanness with anybody - this is very important. ?Even as devotee.
					All of us have potential and weakness.
					St people ask who are superior men or women - this question is redundant, useless, illogical - those who attempt to answer also get into vicious cycle.
						Both are different is the answer.
						Padma puran says human life has 4 lakh varieties.
						Tortoise vs rabbit - st rabbit may lose cuz of laxity but can't make that into rule.
						Lion and elephant - elephant will win in eating and lion in ferrocity.
						Bhima vs Raghunath DG on eating - who will win?
						Diversity is so limitless.
				Dualities do exist in MB characters
					MB doesn't make them only devi.
					Modern narratives do - why? - all women are good and all men are bad.
					empowering women narratives but you go to their lives there is a gap between stage and lives.
					even women become cause of abusing other women.
					1 lady who was gang raped at 17 on being told that she deserved it.
						Parent unfortunately into analysis of why this happened or that happened - how we could have saved it.
						another approach is glass fell and broke accept it - ensure it does not happen again.
						Death penalty to predators will give her some satisfaction but still emotional life is deeply affected.
						She decides that in her life she is gonna help those victims - such girls had become prosti and would spit at face.
						After some months they revealed - we are brought here by women only and don't trust any woman anymore.
						Bad is not done men to men to men to women and so on - it is not gender centric but an attitude.
					MB brings good side and negative side of all - including genders dimension - mother is not always good.
						Idealistic mothers sometimes - children ask icecream you refuse they eventually stop asking and these idealistic women grumble that they were being taken advantage of.
						MB is so brutally honest - Vyasa dev or Manu are brutally honest - MB is not about niceness - it's laws of nature.
						women's determination can become cause of her stubbornness - 3 hath - stri hath is one of them.
						Protection is good but can become narrow minded.
					Vyasadev tells nothing is all good and also all bad.
						Small act but mistake can destroy whole dynasty.
			Her father agreed for marriage to Dhritarashtra for political alliance.
				Application - Every choice has its consequences.
					Marriage is meant to be more than political alliance - ?like willingness, compatibility also important.
				She obeyed her father without uttering a word.
				Blessings from Shiva to have 100 sons - she was a devotee from her childhood.
				The culture of marriages for alliance alone - kings won't even be able to say no.
				Krishna in one sense came to break this tradition also
					instead of asking why did Krishna marry so many; they ask why he had to married so many?
				Rukmini's marriage was also an alliance proposal only.
					fortunately she took responsibility and didn't play victim card.
					arranged marriage or love - those who propose and marry - both responsible - fire burns whether voluntary or mistake.
					laws of nature give no excuse - material nature is mechanistic
					So just trying to explain some other source other than ourselves.
					So many marriages are based on the principle of respecting elders - who says you should not.
					But besides that you should also respect your own conscience, you gut feel.
					someone disturbed in marriage - I ask - you married cuz you wanted, family wanted or were confused.
					So many situations where they say they thought jane do abhi kar leta hoon - can't do it like that.
					agar jaane do you essentially say ki aane do [miseries, etc]
					Rukmini wrote letter to Krishna - first original, authentic, shastric, dharmik love letter.
					Krishna earlier did not go for Revati cuz he recalled pains caused to Sita and in dwapar people are complex with good and bad both in people.
					Then letter from Rukmini Krishna said let's go.
					Krishna married all of them cuz they needed protection and shelter.
					How can Krishna be questioned - he has compassion but he also has capacity.
					He had power to expand himself for every person.
					He knew that 1 form can't suffice for 16108 wives so he expanded
					?Krishna in human like form but won't shirk from displaying godhood if necessary
				Her land was Afghanistan - the land of restlessness since ages.
					weather conditions (including psychological conditions) always changing there.
			Determination vows she took.
				Application - not every act of determination right. It's very difficult to blindfold but is it beneficial?
				There is religiosity, spirituality and race.
					Afghan race famous for keeping their promise or determination.
					race is deeper than religion. Afghans have nothing to do with Arabs. And Arabs with Persian.
					Mecca but different gates as per which race you belong to.
					German christian and british christian some differences. Britain English treat American english like child.
					Marriage is not about these. Marriage is about compatibility, relationship, satisfaction and happiness.
					Marriage can not be outta compassion but should be outta compatibility.
					If compassion, then you will end up showing compassion for life. You will get an object of compassion.
				Was tying belt on eyes beneficial to her?
					Was it only commitment to her husband or more to it.
					Both Gandhari and Shakuni were experts in economics - arthashastra.
					Shakuni was rebirth of disciple of prahlad - Nagnajit.
					Why Shalya joined Kauravas - he was brother of Prahlad in last life but conflict of heart in last life.
			Sanskars - influences of childhood never go away.
				Application - internal strength and devotion saves her from wicked associations.
				Patterns of life can't be taken away - pyscho nature which affects our physical personality.
				Taking DS or KC is easy - it's hatke - but I have to go deeper.
					Tell the story of how I stayed in KC is far more important than how I came.
				Spending 300 crores on day of marriage is good but staying happy for 300 days is better.
				100 sons dedicated to Duryodhan's mindset and brother always scheming against Pandavas - how she survived? Strong internally.
					How would shakuni get sleep and uluk son also.
				Sanskars
					Matri Devo Bhava
						Container, Samskara.
					Pitri Devo Bhava
						Content, Information of life, Practicality.
					Acarya Devo bhava
						Utility for right reasons.
						Spiritualizing.
					Aap svarna kalash mein kachra nahi dalte - garbage on silver plate.
						both tub we enter but won't put sweet rice there.
						bathroom has utility but not purity.
						Shoes always out - separate thing that winter and it's difficult.
						Home dog and outside dog are separate.
					Dog outside the house but cow can be inside - no partiality but science.
					Seed on infertile ground - guru will not change seed but facilitate disciple.
						Kapil Muni counts 250 varieties of DS - MOG, MOI, etc.
						My path is greatest path for devotee in MOI or so.
						violence towards other - exclusive and loyalty and so violence to others.
						loyalty => narrow => exclusive => violence to others.
						In MOI, Bhakti is separatist mentality but in MOG - cooperative DS.
						I will not convert to your level but sympathetic to your level of God consciousness.
			Making Duryodhan's body of vajra is not in Vyasa's MB and undermines her dharma.
				Application - People's knowledge is a lot outside of MB so that's why they imagine things.
					giving blessing has maryada and also capability required to take it.
				It may be in puranas or folktales.
				She never blessed Duryodhan with victory - where there is dharma, there will be victory.
				How can you go to mother wearing only directions.
				gazed so powerful then steel body - nice story but not there in MB.
				She never supported her evil sons.
				Imagine the values that could not give false ashirvad.
					and also values that Duryodhan would still come to mother for blessings ed.
				Duryodhan had numerous curses - all sages. Pandavas got blessings from e1.
					empty blessings not enough - capabilities to take the blessings also required.
			Gandhari's boldness to tell Dhritarashtra to discard Duryodhan after Draupadi's disrobing which even Bhisma and Drona could not.
				Application - st better act right late than never.
				Dhritarashtra replied - let our kula go to hell but I can't reject my son, nor gambling match.
				Dhritarashtra like a worm - her terrible fortune to have fully blind husband and toxic children.
				We could not discard when born as per Vidura but at least now.
				st your child comes as your enemy - scorpion's child born tearing mother's womb.
				scorpion bite from person who was bitten said it's like putting hand in door and closing again and again - you scream but won't die.
				Tara cautions Vali - how could he come back after beaten.
					Don't challenge him - make peace with him - "you less intelligent lady I am going" and loses his life.
			Her little weakness - lead to colossal war - like small spark in petroleum.
				Application - sanskars in formative years do matter.
					Laws are very stringent and unforgiving so we have to practice caution.
				child has no arrogance or false adventure in putting hand in high voltage socket - a life of unworking hand.
				Kunti already given birth to son - envy immense at that time for Duryodhan who had not come out for 2 years then.
				stuck her belly this sanskar is very strong and difficult to give up.
				onion no matter which layer we peel, we get same effect. Very deep rooted sanskar.
				Kunti - 13 year old has desire for adventure and curiosity so sun visible and asked for him. This lead to lifetime regret.
					It's not fair - but law says you put hand in socket - Krishna is angry - no, material nature is mechanistic - please understand.
					We can play with consciousness (that's KC) but not laws of nature.
					sb wants to give you gift in chambal then you get gift but lose life - this jewel to ugrasen said Krishna.
					Satrajit lost life and created so much strife. Krishna balaram fought and Duryodhan advantage to alliance with Balram and married daughter.
					Sun said you must take this benediction - I can't - no you must.
					Kunti in chandra dynasty and Sun - so grahan is the result.
					Has power to impact everything.
				After karna death, kunti tells the truth.
					2nd time he lost his temper how you could not tell.
					I curse women won't be able to keep secrets - Krishna you knew this - yes - why not told - for you.
			Action at right time - Warnings but not fearful - be careful - Some cares to be taken like for swimming
				Application - Need for acting at right time.
				at some point she should have asked shakuni for leave.
				suffering is like burden and break down is human nature after certain point - husband, son and no action at right time - banyan tree was difficult to cut with passing time.
				Vidura said to Krishna - it won't work - I know but it's my nature to give chance.
				Bhagavan ki daya covers his intelligence.
			Gandhari was waiting to curse pandavas - Vyasa told what are you going to do.
				Application - some psychological manipulation helps (praising your opponent to his allies)
					Krishna saves his devotee by taking curse on himself.
				Vyasa - You never gave blessing of victory - your words came true - what are you about to do.
				Yes but the pain covers my intel.
				Why you killed illegally - Bhima glorified Duryodhan that it was impossible to defeat him without - this pacified her and she spares the curse.
				Kunti looks yudhisthir's feet from the corner and his finger turned black and blue. Arjuna hides behind Krishna.
				Devs of Krishna - sensitive and accepting the power of dharmik lady.
					I am Krishna's devotee, I can go anywhere - and they don't come back - understand the universal laws.
				Soldier had courage of fighting but also ask forgiveness from their mother - what flavors of MB.
			Cover eyes and curiosity to see will come - some commentators by uncovering she could serve better - now 3rd person has to help.
				Application - It's easy to take determination than to maintain it.
					Krishna's doesn't only forgives but forgets - very playful and sportive even at taking curse.
				She wanted to see battleground and Vyasa to enable her sight - seeing sons dead and animals pulling flesh.
				Krishna I see all bodies homogenized into 5 tattva - earth, water, air, etc.
				Result of MB - complete royalty clan was lost. Vaishya and shudra remains.
				Krishna you are God. You should have not done this.
				If Krishna is God, why made me bald at 27. Want to have dialogue with God when sufferings.
				Krishna is sportive - jaane do na kya fark padta hai - no offence taken. Even forgiveness shows I am great.
				What if he goes mad if I ask this question.
				Draupadi could ask this question and she did when there is relationship
					Krishna not victim card I did so much to you; no, Krishna cried I am sorry.
					and departed thinking that late.
			Yadu dynasty to be lost and Krishna would die from hunter.
				Application - Krishna emotionally sensitive even while being cursed.
					Life full of pains for Kunti also but whether they helped you please Krishna or curse Krishna is your choice.
				No counter curse from Krishna but Krishna just smiled.
				This is not depicted in any movies or series but only Vyasa.
				Such character you won't find anywhere - this must be God.
				Then he speaks vedantik truth.
				Just like Brahmin wants son who is tapasvi; cow to bull for pulling weight; vaishyas for cow protection; sudras to children work hard. You might have given birth to children to die and kill.
				She was first among haters of Krishna for MB.
				Her lamentation was focussed on her children, instead of seeing the full picture.
				Her intense pain thru life but wrong understanding.
				Dharma tapasya was balloon and blew it off so very satisfied - Pandavas welfare done.
				Krishna said Pandavas very dear to me - I can skin myself for them.
				vs Kunti - life full of challenges - but asked for more pain for Krishna consciousness.
				Paundraka gave pleasure to Krishna he laughed with wooden handouts - but cuz pleasure he got sayujya.
			Eventually she would perfect her life.
				her earlier life adarsh without vyavahar.
			Next we study a teacher to practical vyavaharik - agenda driven teacher - adarsh lost.
		</Gandhari>
		<Drona>
		Drona -
			Application - poverty becomes a curse cuz the money buys you.
			The teacher with agenda
				Application - Personal problem st indicates a social problem.
				Application - not wrong to point out flaws in order to learn from them.
				Kunti - It's not about Draupadi but the system - justice is beyond a person.
				Arjuna - may we be victorious - if you would not come to me, I would curse you.
					His psychology revealed here - to Yudhisthir he said - I was servant of artha - money is nobody's servant so fought for Kurus.
					To practice dharma properly, 1 needs minimum level of material security.
					Povery living conditions and ambition for friendship were the cause for him having agenda of money.
				Don't talk about blunders of ordinary people cuz they do.
					women oppressed in past - without seeing other side is pop in intellectual side.
					No1 should be completely slandered and completely flattered - they are big adharma. What we need is critical analysis.
					You do have right to say if a meal has salt or not - whether you are good cook or not.
					mind, heart, intel integration should be seen.
				SP - Povery destroys all your good qualities. They become like museum locked up.
					Therefore Chanakya - root of dharma is in artha.
					Drona so poor that could not give milk to Ashvatthama - wheat floor in water.
			His strategy
				Application - use your interests for varna and hence artha.
				didn't teach anything other than warfare.
				special interest in archery, when it was not emergency.
				teaching management and becoming manager are different things.
				Bhishma and Yudhisthir talk - even why daughters don't inherit and not word called dowry but later.
					ppt makes me focussed although unnatural for me.
			Irony of parashurama's students
				Application - world of dualities with Parashuram's students also.
				Bhishma - kshatriya warrior renounced kingsman ship (became brahminical)
				Drona - poor brahmin became active warrior.
				Karna - died due to a curse.
				All of them fought against Krishna.
			Birth, background - Varna Sankar
				Application - Compatible Marriages and sanskars are important.
				Application - gurukul to connect and learn simplicity.
				son of bharadwaja rishi. born in a vessel called Dona.
				Drona - container to collect some rasa - aspect measurement in practice.
				married to kripi - the sister of Kripa.
					Kripa was brahmin birth but raised by shantanu so those qualities.
				Drona also got kshatriya sanskars from parents (brahmin + kshatriya)
					Brahmin should inspire kshatriya and kshatriya should protect
						not impose ideas from Brahmin then no kshatriya
						brutal if not guided.
						non-violence is principle not an application all the time.
					Both roles like pope of Vatican (also a king)
						but changed - multi-tasking emergencies is ok but expert at sth not eth.
					sumantra was mixed caste - actually caste concept didn't exist it was fluid.
						current caste system in name of progress has become degraded
						Gandhari consciousness current civilization suffers - cursing without knowing in full.
					Varna sankara power seen thru life of Drona -
						cause of the war between kuru and panchala.
						e1 was destroyed including his son.
				why kshatriya spent time in gurukul life
					extreme simplicity - king then intoxication it will cause but simple life at ashram.
					Boy had 7 security guards in international school - it's a curse; won't help me enjoy his boyhood.
					limitless diversity is seen so no question of pride. Beg in all homes - not attached to specific people.
					when they beg they learn the right to communicate.
					illusions like All rich are bad and all poor are bad or good get clarified.
					books don't teach you all this - they teach high disparity; rich priveleged and poor had difficulties - education for royal.
					especially important for royal cuz future kings must see the other side of life.
			His involvement into education
				Applications - Develop personality as Character, skills, values, purpose.
					Others only help you identify your nature - no1 decides your VA.
				Personality - tuple of 4 - Skills, values, character, purpose.
					Values are very relative in terms.
						founder's thinking on education becomes ideology.
					Character not spoken much
						only relative values - want rituals of truth without character.
						reduced to only value education these days.
					purpose - USA idea of education was organized.
						book of "Dumbing us down" - taught in best schools and realized.
						belief system to create labors and not entrepreneurs or original thinkers is deep rooted.
						rival researcher of Darwin - might is right and survival of fittest vs cooperation in life.
						explore and not rival - not lost in institute and teacher - explore life.
						Grow in relationships. Thinkers not labors.
						Fight ignorance. Fight infringement. Fight insufficiency. Fight indolence.
						Yuddha of ajnaana, arakshaa, abhaav, alasya. All have to contribute.
						e1's skill is utility for others in VA.
							A lauhar is independent - he sells his commodity if he wants.
						Modern - We talk about independence, liberal, etc but all are working under.
							no1 work for themselves - their ideology becomes yours.
				Who decides what to work on - I won't fight them.
					Krishna - no1 decides. Others support you decide your path based on nature.
					When others decide for you - they have an agenda.
					They mould your personality based on their agenda.
					1906 or 1911 - organized education came into being with agenda of making labors.
					original thinkers are very disruptive in nature.
					Weapons of mass instructions - rules destroy the creativity of child.
					Freedom and rule (discipline) both are required else recklessness and slavery if only 1 of them.
						noose around neck can't be progress.
						stand in line; dhoti is ritual and coat is advanced?
					Blind rituals - not based on change of attire - married and divorced without their knowledge.
						Ishwarchand Vidyasagar to a friends party - party in coat cuz affected by britishers.
							Party has dress etiquette and changed it and came back.
							eat now - so put it on coat - what are you doing - you invited not me but my coat so feeding them.
						Drink or gutkha - once in a school 11th class and gutkha around eb - tell me a reason why - I will also eat - no1 able to give a valid reason.
							friend told me to eat.
							Even for good - why chanting cuz mother is chanting - if she stops you will stop.
						Follow mahajans but use logic also.
					Uttarakhand Industrialist became teacher.
						teaching students and they said you destroyed our children or spoilt.
						why so - cuz need of parents was connected to core occupation at home.
						Abdul Kalam lecture we need scientists and 1 boy asked what about farmers sir
							called him and made him sit next to him till airport that taught a good lesson.
						over-emphasis based on need of market we get laborers.
			Powerful with word and sword
				Application - can give shelter with word and sword (very talented)
				on tongue he has 4 vedas.
				with hands the skill of archery.
				skillful with word and sword.
				can curse or give shelter.
			Extreme poor but wanted friendship of Drupad.
				Application - being too simplicity in worldly friendship. Krishna's friendship is different.
				to simple to trust Drupad for his word.
				Parashuram asked could you make me all wealth - people feared him for his teacher who destroyed kshatriyas.
					Ashvatthama didn't know milk like without internet some devs didn't know paneer or shrikhand.
				Politics works like you won't recognize mother if doesn't serve and make enemy as friend if apt.
				Krishna didn't give anything for Sudama and sudama didn't curse.
					Krishna thought his offering can't be compared to riches so in the background he gave.
				Drupada asked what he wanted - simplistically Drona said friendship - what's your calibre.
					4 reasons of friendship - Truce, Powerful influence, Nature, Material wealth.
					we were not relatives but classmate and in friendship we don't ask.
				give a charity without telling friend no. Asking at wrong time, friendship lost.
					resource for friends given as charity and they can return when possible. If don't, then it was charity anyways.
				MB war also called as panchal kuru war. Not kuru pandava war.
					no caste if you see in the kripa lineage
					1 forefather was rishi and next generation is king and so forth.
					Kripa and kripi had conenction with panchala who had cold war with kurus.
					Bhishma was careful with panchals.
					Drona what will you give me if I take out this ball - whatever you want
					Drona blatantly asked for Drupada fight after training - Bhishma agreed to Drona terms without consequences cuz keen on good training of children.
			Agenda to teach: revenge
				Application - elicit best services from a person given their nature and constraints.
					Show interest in person's interests and they will like you.
				Looked for right moment and right people - found kurus.
				Didn't teach any dharma consciously.
				Avoided dharmik spirituality.
				was only a teacher with skills.
				Remained loyal to kurus based on artha.
				Who will fulfill my desire asked Drona and Arjuna raised his hand so I will train you best.
					Deep attachment - Arjuna outburst on killing Drona that he criticized e1 including Krishna.
					all have different perspectives and flavor of truth in it.
				So he taught Arjuna the best with full focus.
					Others took training for outside also later - Bhima and Duryodhan from Balaram.
					Arjuna also later learnt from many other sources but refined personality so gave credit to Drona always.
					btw Karna also learnt from Drona as per MB and later goes to Parashuram to get more astra.
					Water filling partiality - bigger drona with Ashvatthama to finish tasks and get learning. Arjuna used varuna astra speciality and being pleased Drona taught him also.
					Brahmastra to Arjuna but not son - he insisted so given.
			Ending - political alertness kills Drona
				Application - Broad minded to tell his kill secret.
					sometimes family attachment makes you weaker.
					lie still has an effect even if spoken for and on instruction of Krishna.
						KC means willingness for hell not just in letter but literally.
						And to actually choose Krishna even when sth else seems very alluring.
				Drona questions Yudhisthir about death of Aswatthama - Arjuna unwilling.
				Bhima condemns Drona - for sake of attachment to son, he killed e1 without discrimination.
				Brahmin with no discrimination.
				As person he paid obeisance but as king asks question from Bhishma, Drona, Shalya and Kripa
					how may I kill you. Drona said I can't be but departure of 7 dear.
					Yudhisthir forgets but not Krishna - gotta be politically very alert.
				In drama and movie different - public display so no cut allowed and present with emotions in 1 go.
					1 person in North America - drama he would be able to make you cry and then laugh.
				Asakti kills the potential of children - branding children - minimizes their children.
					lost interest in battle but more brutal and fierce since gonna die now. 40K in the battle.
					demigods said you are brahmin - supposed to guide and not kill - became neutral to battle.
				Yudhisthir said man not elephant and krishna blew conchshell is not the MB story - only masala adding.
					actually he spoke man loudly but elephant very silently to convince himself that I didn't tell a lie.
					cuz of habit of truth.
					More unhappy and detached but fought - bhima blasted the teacher not a revenge from childhood on teacher.
					chariot came down - in practicality it makes no difference - no utility - cuz of lie only.
						He had to experience hell cuz of lie - DS is not putting responsibility on Krishna for following him.
						If circumstantial DS then that's not pure DS.
						Whether heavenly situation or hellish situation, I am with you.
						It's not poetry, 1 has to literally go thru if DS.
					Arjuna - I will fight but need your relationship Krishna.
						so it is important to be qualified in order to do DS else we can't do.
						We are not supposed to be burden to Krishna but shoulder.
			Price of ill treatment to the body - Jiva is still soul.
				Application - st overdoing a right thing starts to cause a problem. Need to know when to stop.
					Emotional reality should not be made objective reality (Arjuna on teacher's demise)
					Humility and shelter taking saves from even the power of Narayan Astra.
				Hiranya dies then prayers. Vibhishan told to do last rites.
				Drona separated from attachment - remembered Vishnu. Om chant and invoked presence of Lord.
					Body there but sadhana was so strong that soul departed from body b4 - fortunate for me to see - Krishna also saw.
				Dhrishtadyumna - supposed to respect teacher - defeated but don't kill him - threw head away.
					Drupad being insulted had done yajna for son to kill Drona and daughter to marry Arjuna.
					This was Arjuna's quality to become fascination even among enemies.
					Bhima celebrated by hugging Dhrishtadyumna.
					This treatment was so anger causing to Ashvatthma and that I will kill whole army with Brahmastra.
					This opportunity used by Arjuna to chastise Yudhisthir - outburst outta affection for children - Bhagavan aparadh of forgetting BG.
						must be going to hell for doing this.
				Emotional reality should not be seen as absolute reality.
					so practicality to see every sound.
					reality is not 0 or 1 - superficial religions teach you right and wrong but justice is narrative centric.
					TPC to be considered - modern times we question what you did but vedas why you did.
					punish the house when son misbehaves.
					We ignore the layers of reality
					SB and CC say - This concept of this right and wrong is already wrong.
						this is bhadra and this is abhadra.
					If jealous god then Krishna would have become angry against Arjuna.
						don't hear just words but emotions.
					Body was disrespected - the body is made temple - attachment and agenda - great offence from rule perspective against Drona.
				Ashvatthama fires but Narayana astra's solution known to him.
					humility. MB should have been read by Gandhi - bow down and when not to bow down.
					Bhima with his spirit marenge but jhukenge nahi - maratha spirit.
					Business people lose money cuz ego of not losing although intelligent otherwise.
					Arjuna bowed that I can give up Gandiva for cows, brahmins, shelters and Narayan astra.
					Killing ego is bigger than people so I win said Ashvatthama - shut up said Duryodhan this ain't ashram.
		</Drona>
		<Karna>
		Karna
			Application - dangers of misdirected loyalties
			Loyalty - vs Vikarna, vs Vibhishan, vs Aristotle.
				Application - Good Qualities vs Dharma - Dharma is more important cuz qualities have flip side and can cause immature stand.
				Loyalty definition - values localty more than 1's own life.
					mental psychology - loyalty centered on person not principle.
					When in dire need and provided - emotional contact so strong that loyalty maintained even when crooked.
				Karna's loyalty -
					individual - he may have gained reverence.
					collective perspective - hindered him from fighting for the right cause - fight for dharma.
				vs Vikarna spoke against vastra haran but not powerful so ridiculed
					Application - Character without competence isn't enough.
					small boy you shut up. Only vidura had spoken none else.
					battle followed family instead of dharma.
					Bhima killed him with respects. and Verbal pay.
				vs Vibhishan - loyal to family but more to dharma.
				vs Aristotle - I love my teacher plato but truth is dearer.
				attacking king vs kingdom recent 1000 years - disrupt civil societies.
				Vibhishan - not an opportunist
					Application - st action is so much right (beyond scope of people) that it is misunderstood.
					Theorists - abondoned brother when thinking that bro may lose the land.
					this is my place but not as servant of Ravan but critical and good advice.
					Kumbhakarna - in battle I lose discrimination then don't come in front and need sb to do last rites.
				Loyalty - vice or virtue - has down side also.
					Application - Loyalty should balance individual and social fronts both.
					Powerful medium and facilitates in the growth of a relation or it may also aid in the betterment of a situation.
					Becomes a very vicious trap that makes it difficult for 7's loyalty to break away.
					Krishna - World is designed in such a way that duality is the core principle of life.
					truthful but family became poverty stricken.
					valorous - forgave mughal sardar - compassion so forgave - Shivaji chastised him scorpion should not be spared as per MB.
						even small weed left out, it will grow back.
						so went in the camps of Diler Khan - maddened heroes killed few people but slaughtered to pieces later cuz still mad strategy.
					Dharma isn't truth, compassion, love, magnanimity - all of these have a flip side.
						Application - Dharma != Attitude or qualities or kartavya or religion => follow qualities as subservient to dharma.
						?Dharma is doing natural for the role or being for the shreyas - not moody but in objectivity.
						Love - wife lost husband at 44 and didn't know what to do.
							Application - Use love to empower not disable you.
							who experienced unconditional love has become conditioned by time.
							time so powerful - other party useless that can't live.
						Dharma as narrative ethics and law ethics - what happened and why happened.
							Application - prefer terms dharma, kar, pravas, etc over their stereotyped english equivalent.
								Balance himsa and ahimsa aptly.
							why happened is more important.
							the war MB is not necessarily dharmik cuz it's war - BG doesn't propose war as dharma.
							MB also teaches ahimsa paramo dharma - that's 1 aspect - but st violence is necessary.
							MB has nth to do with Krishna proposing violence.
							What is dharma? First, there is no equivalent word for dharma in any non-vedic vocabulary.
							What's kar? not tax - tax means trouble in life - taxing my brain - kar is ray of mean or hand
								when kar is taken it's like a ray of sun evaporating the water - taking some money from citizens.
								and returns as clouds.
							Yudhisthir didn't take tax when not ready - taking extra honey without hurting honey bees.
							even words make our consciousness
								hit the road vs pravas karna. Kar vs tax. Dharma vs religion or even kartavya.
							Even Dhritarashtra had great predictive powers but didn't act.
			Karna represents a hindu - personal over social
				Application - social obligation more important than personal obligation.
				has numerous books as a hero - but won't name their child as karna cuz sign of failure.
				There is Arjuna award but no karna award - balanced, etc.
				Pejavar Swami - Duryodhan represents power of buying. Karna represents a hindu.
					Application - Gradually we gotta learn to appreciate the social side besides personal obligations.
					Ask any liberal hindu - more from personal level - I am personal genuinely practicing hindu, not concerned with society.
					British brought us railways. or education - it's debatable as per Shashi Tharur books.
					While travelling on trains they only see personal perspective of trains benefitted them
					but not why they created and what could have been.
				Children play - deal with victory and defeat - sportive where fun of game is more important than winning - learn to deal with dualities.
					But play becomes profession then winning is important.
				dumbing us down author said - Only 3 languages - mother tongue, music and art
					when foreign tongue used - sensitivity reduces and intel of mentally retarded child level intel.
					Americans difficulty in reading normal things - all different countries - only english people can do multi-tasking.
					If n languages then can do multitasking.
					If 1 language, then incentive to learn more is lost many a times.
					Power of language - sanskrit is language of cooperativeness.
					learnt new Russian language in 3 months cuz knew sanskrit.
					Gujaratis not fanatic but speak gujarati wherever they go.
			Karna - dangers of simplistic vision - saw life as a bamboo tree but it's a banyan tree
				Application - Life is banyan tree not bamboo - learn to see complete picture (wrt to time, people, events)
					avoid getting emotional over a few details forgetting the full picture of the past and future possibilities.
				gotta reconcile past, present and future.
					don't get stuck with only few instances of the past.
				1 problem of Indians is that we show no enthusiasm for history
					?or it's either not known or not presented properly - avoid simplistic vision cuz of ignorance.
					Those who don't study history - repeat it.
				south Indian temples you go there but rituals and no1 to give knowledge.
					good at giving knowledge but gotta do it.
					BSS - deity darshan is eye massage without knowledge.
					Some Vastu say no MB at home - it causes fights - like we don't do otherwise.
						Just see how our narratives have changed.
				Past does not control our present but has influence over it.
					Law of karma doesn't control future but alert me to it, inspire me to future, etc.
					Past present future terms are for convenience actually there are streams going.
				Vedas - don't focus so much on death cuz that's not conclusion of life.
					Application - think about death appropriately - not too much, not too less.
					We in extremes - either no death and material illlusions OR only death and paralysed.
					dying ed cuz death will come - forgetting to live.
					those who live are not reflective.
					BG - don't worry about life or death but about svadharma.
					Getting out on 0 and depressed over it then when will you play again.
					0 or 100 - play is important - jiva soul being eternal will play eternally.
					greatest crime is merge into non-existence - you don't relate to friends, relatives, etc.
						that leads to life of isolation - not contributing to others or yourself.
				Karna is fascinating but destructive character.
					Application - choose heroes wisely.
					as per me, greatest villain in MB.
					Power to attract you but life of isolation and selfishness is the result.
				Book nations fail - 1 theory tropical countries are lazy so no impetus to economic improvement.
					Application - in aaroh, logics can be biased (incomplete or twisted) to present a picture or narrative (to serve selfish interests) - 4 flaws.
					sounds correct in isolation.
					Eg - Europe grew - cuz of protestant ethics - adding religious angle to it.
					Now, if you see last 200 years it may appear so. Even saints can be called so.
					Eg - But study history of economics - not fictional stories but recorded history.
						GDP contribution to world was 24% average. 36% also.
						China - in history used to be good competitor 28-30-32% but others nowhere close.
					Eg - Ramdas to Rajputs - going to aurangzeb to surrender - why? cuz chakravarti is expansion of vishnu.
						such destructive undertandings.
					Eg - English came to rule in India - let them rule.
				1st PM - temples of India are the cause of our lack of growth.
					Hindu growth rate he said (which is not good) - slow progress meaning.
					My modern temples are history - he had read superficial readings of scriptures.
					Where studied and from whom is the question - where Mahatma Gandhi got his first BG? from London.
					In that poetry MB was presented as brutal history of India - MB the warfare and Krishna as violent god.
					BG - symbolic representation of it.
					This symbolism seemed so good - never went out of the body - MB seen in the body only.
					Gandhi - if MB took place I am ashamed to call myself hindu. So, attachments to qualities becoming stronger.
					This is all karna-ism - habit to see things with narrow perspective.
			Loyalty towards person or principle
				Application - Following principle is more important than person.
				VA system - loyalty should be with principles not persons.
				loyalty to person without principle - obsession.
				loyalty to principle without person - lose critical thinking and ease of elevation.
				Why GSS tripod system is so important?
					Guru sadhu shastra - 1 guru, 2 disciples with indpendent mind, experiences, senses, alerness, etc.
					contradiction in understanding guru - chocolate to be eaten or not.
					SP - let's have this castle - yes SP, jay SP. Let's have this ground - yes SP, jay SP. Let's have this dog - yes SP, jay SP - nonsense, that's blind following.
				1 of greatest debate was Shankaracarya and Mandan Mishra - Karma Kanda vs Jnana Kanda and vairagya.
					They didn't use to go to public debates and create controversies but talk to scholars and influence thinking.
					Traditionally marriage or sth - sanyasi is not invited.
						cuz sanyas sends vibration of vairagya.
						Conducted by grihastha sages.
					came inside and asked to give donation (culture); these days 7 asks he will ask for MLA seat ticket.
						he said donation of debate - he said ok who be the judge - your wife (and some think women suppressed)
						2 great scholars and judge is wife - the concept of housewife is not Indian actually - cuz no high buildings but construction on kshetra (more wide than high)
						she was very loyal so in dharma sankat - disloyal to husband or truth?
						As Shankaracarya winning the debate - loyal to justice - but high command vs high principle.
						She gave decision of Shankaracarya winning the debate but challenged to debate with Shankaracarya and chose the subject of sambhog.
				Yudhisthir allowed free speech - give feedback to king on face; not free speech of bharat tere tukde gang.
				Conflict between Prahlad's son and Shukracarya's son - both looked good and girl said you decide whom I should marry.
					so Prahlad to resolve this - now what's right - too idealistic to let adharma happen to son or favor the son - what's right.
					Prahlad chose what was right.
				1 noteworthy principle - Krishna always installed a localite as a king not outsider
					who understands you culture - consulting is ok but not ruling.
			Karna vs Kunti
				Application - empathy vs actions judgment.
				Karna judged Kunti for her actions not intentions.
					never gave benefit of doubt why he did so.
					Adhirath was like Sanjay b4 - suta.
					Even Kunti was an adopted child but didn't make an issue out of this.
					He became event centric not the reason.
				But why Kunti left Karna
					Person centric - abondoning cuz he was karna (like abondoned cuz it's a girl or so)
					Principle centric - abondoned cuz she was in tough situation.
						13 years old girl in this situation - even in USA of current it's so tough imagine that time and that culture.
						her mistake was her curiosity - no1 will believe that surya deva gave.
				1 bharatiya vidya bhavan - girls orphans but such confidence for Krishna lila - 400 girls.
			Karna as Angaraj - Match fixing
				Application - human psychology with legitimate emotions can be taken advantage of.
				In MB, It was a fixed match - not that they met first time, they were friends b4.
					people present it differently but that's not Vyasa's MB.
				not from royal family - stay away from royal is what parents generally tell and good instruction (afford power, etc.)
					friends with equals is important principle for all times.
				Duryodhan sent Karna to perform.
					Kripa asks your family background (etiquette question) - he felt humiliated.
					Bhima is not soft whether Yudhisthir to burn hands for gambling, Drona for adham brahmin or so. Krishna beware.
					So here, if not from royal then what are you doing.
					Duryodhan - bhima, lion babies appear lions not rabbits.
						if not royal then angadesh king - was a great investment - life long impact on karna.
				His loyalty came from the fact that Duryodhan purchased him which appeared like empowerment.
					It's difficult to analyse a person who has raised you from rags to riches.
					People get lost in such relation instead of rising.
					So, Karna eventually stood by him for eth - disrobing, burning pandavas - rebelled but followed.
					Draupadi disrobing - there is no denial of his active involvement.
			Karna's qualities - attracted to following
				magnanimity - Duryodhan - discovered him.
				Affection - Radha and Adiratha - raised him.
				Justice - Kuru kula - trusted him.
			Karna and Krishna
				Krishna never asked Karna to give up his friendship with Duryodhan.
				advised that Pandavas would willingly crown him as the king of hastinapur.
				If Duryodhan was indeed Karna's true friend he would be happy but karna knew that was not truth.
				If kurus and pandavas comes together even Indra won't look at hastinapur.
				Rule properly as per dharma - even SG centered is still ok. Give them 5 villages.
				Krishna's nature is - he may chastise Karna but come out fresh next day like nothing happened. Gives opportunity.
				Spoke not to make Karna weak - Karna said I knew this already.
				Karna asked Krishna not to tell Yudhisthir. Even if you gimme kingdom I will hand it over to Duryodhan.
				What is this - blind loyalty?
				Krishna's affection to jivas is based on what they represent - not people but principles in BG chapter 16 - never person centric.
				Krishna can kill shishupal - he was family. Why kill Ghatotkach - Krishna celebrated - Arjuna asked which side - dharma Krishna answered.
				Bhishma defeated cuz on the side of adharma even if so exalted.
				BG is not a book on religion or favoritism -
				If Krishna is devotee centric then devotee will do any thing and say that I am Krishna's devotee so doesn't matter.
				Shelter means loyalty to principle not person - Krishna shoots kills his qualities not person.
					Who would do final rites of Ravan after the fight and all that he had done to him.
					Ram said the problem is not Ravan but his activities - Krishna saw jiva soul in Ravan.
					If you don't, I will perform his rites.
					Bhima stepped on Duryodhan's head - Krishna said don't do cuz royal family - don't celebrate perversion.
				Haridas Thakur - they said don't give him muslim or hindu rites - each party said.
					this is fanaticism - instead of having people principle centered, they make principles person centered.
				In friendship it's good but friendship is not above society.
					plastic dropping from me doesn't make difference - garbage all around cuz e1 thought so.
				Karna refused to fight when Bhishma diminished him and won't deny Duryodhan cuz that will bring him bad name.
					shows that he had status anxiety and not just waiting to die fight but just die.
				Maya danav - get sth - no my kshatriya dharma - ok some knowledge exchange please.
				Krishna gives opportunity with alertness
					kadacitki bhakti - do once in a year but do that.
					Karna is status conscious - didn't fight cuz demeaned by Bhishma.
			Karna donation.
				status symbol fame - no, I am famous as donor so I won't.
				pictured as charity but he wanted sth for offence but only defense not enough.
				shakti weapon came now offence - but Indra said he has Krishna shakti.
				His loyalty was all about presentation - he wants to hear his good side - karna means ears.
				Bhishma tells about Ashvatthama that he is a good fighter but problem is he likes to live - a warrior should not have strong desire to live.
					not living but valor. He is less than half rathi.
					What about karna - he is paper tiger (paraphrase) - he runs away in real battle - victorious always other than with pandavas.
					he kills dead bird showing his valor - defeating those that don't matter.
					Drupad beated Duryodhan and Karna fled.
						Gandharvas Duryodhan captured and Karna fled then also - happy you defeated them.
					Karna is half rathi - this made him very angry internally.
						He never appreciates me - all credit goes to him if I fight with him so I will not fight under him.
						For 10 days he didn't fight - so loyalty is with Duryodhan or himself.
				Karna vs Pandavas - willing to be misunderstood for dharma and karna vv.
					people will think that I left friendship during dire need so weak.
			comparison attitude - Like Krishna for Arjuna I need great chariot.
				Shalya had great ego - balloon filled.
				You are like Krishna - so Shalya's ego boosted so accepted.
				But it was not mutual - fight.
				vs Krishna - without ego would carry Arjuna and Arjuna also request mode.
				Krishna can call Arjuna Eunuch and Arjuna is ok not angry.
				MB gives 100 varieties of flying - crow does eth - hamsa knows only 1.
				Shalya said you are like that crow.
				Karna condemns madar state - you fool how can you blame all the people of some place - good bad ew.
				Karna targets Arjuna - Shalya said target heart - I don't change my aim, shut up.
					Krishna moves horses down by a tap (not just cows) and then move down and arrow goes tangent to Arjuna's crown.
				Arjuna won only cuz of Krishna's partnership - that's what political partnership is.
					no great warrior says I am alone - we need great allies.
				When Karna repairing his tyre not his driver but he had to go down cuz bad taste relationship.
					When Krishna's tyre went inside, Krishna went down. Whose fault is it.
					Shalya proud of his position but not Krishna.
			Karna's death
				Arjuna fair fighter - but when down you can't ask for favors.
					Like when fighting jayadrath and tired horses, Arjuna got down but fighting continued - fighting isn't supposed to stop by that.
					Arjuna never pleaded and fought better on ground.
				Loyal with wrong understanding makes you Gandhari - Karna also curses dharma.
					what's the use of practicing dharma that it is forsaking me now.
					His dharma was connected to his personal friendship alone.
					Krishna became extremely angry - you talk about dharma.
				seldom people talk about their own limitations - rare souls are reflective.
					Krishna enumerated all the adharmik activities of Karna.
					Abhimanyu episode interesting - 16 year boy defeating all the kauravas. Status anxiety for all including karna.
						Duryodhan sends his son Laxman and he was killed - making Duryodhan angry.
						That's when they decided to come together to kill Abhimanyu - still not able to.
						So Duryodhan comes to Drona - what to do with this guy - I will tell you but not take responsibility.
							from front you can't defeat so from behind remove his kavach.
							Karna did that.
					It was karna who put the seed of disrobing Draupadi - 5 husbands is prosti so even clothes removed is ok.
						even prosti have dignity - nb has power or freedom to make her clothless in public place.
				Krishna enumerated all this and first time his ego came down. Head down.
					Krishna said shoot him now and Karna's head came down along with sun.
					Vyasa adores wherever necessary - the kalpa tree of donation gone.
					Vyasa appreciates when necessary but also does not cover his misdeeds.
					He died adventurous death but not heroic death.
					He lived narrow life and not sampurna dharma.
				Some even religious leaders call Krishna shakuni like
					But Krishna does good to the world even if misunderstood.
					Karna so deceptive character that it can mislead.
					Even shalya was misled to glorify him after his death.
				If car hits a cycle and cycle is broken then car driver is blamed.
					once our car hit a boy - driver very practical don't stop that will cause problems.
					He continued driving thru difficult area - at least dozen stones pelted on the car.
				Just dying in battle isn't enough a reason to make karna good.
					loyal. Mother left.
					Stone is pelted on you if you negate.
					lock the limbs - give proper knowledge and not as I wish but as presented by MB as it is.
		</Karna>
		<Bhishma>
		Bhishma
			Application - isolation and integration.
			The evil of good - not that cuz so selfless so must be right.
				their selflessness not enough to take right decisions.
				no arrogance, no overconfidence, no remote controlling people - you always fall in love with his character.
				MB highlights almost all of his decisions were counter to growth of kuru gurukul.
				BG was not spoken to kill the evil people but mainly.
			Does our intention matter?
				Good seed => Good Results.
				Bad Seeds => Bad results.
				Duryodhan was seed that led to war - even though Bhishma had great intentions.
				Could not harmonize 2 cousins.
				Seeds will fructify even though 1 may have great intentions.
				For good results, intentions and seeds should go hand in hand.
				tragedy of life
					good people with good intentions with wrong strategy st create violence beyond their imagination.
				Seeds and Intentions but not miracles.
					failing student looks for miracles not bright ones.
					Ravindranath Tagore got PhD without college he thinks I should be next.
					Laws of nature - life not designed like that.
					fantastic concepts of Bollywood - defeat e1 without even sweat, forget blood.
				Actions matter even if you have good intentions.
					Duryodhan - not good intentions + intention for war.
						vs Bhishma - good intentions and unintentionally caused war.
					Conscious competence - 00, 01, 10, 11
						Conscious competence can defeat conscious incompetence.
						But cuz of unconscious competence - we may have intentions of nurturing 1K variety of rice
							but person with agriculture degree (conscious competence) better production with some fertilizer and we accept.
						Earnings of India was 27% saving - feminine economics is savings centered and masculine economics is heavy spending centered.
							liberalization idea opposed this - you shop till you drop is good for economics.
							1 hearsay story of Lal Bahadur Shastri - Stri means to expand gotta give to all.
								300 Rs you lend to others - how? we spend only 2/3 of our earning.
				Life is a gift of nature
					but beautiful living is a gift of wisdom.
					Common sense - unlimited information in current age but application is very less.
					Bhishma had gift of best in everything -
						teacher - parashuram (martial knowledge)
							taught him while doing kshatriya slaughter.
						Brihaspati - practical knowledge.
						Vasishtha - spiritual knowledge.
						Self learnt - shukra niti - ethics.
						As he was never shaken from dharma even a bit, he was given status of Devavrata.
			Life -
				No controversy with him but only pain.
					Journey of shooting at Bhishma was not easy.
					Never shook from dharma - never selfish.
					How can 1 be angry with Bhishma dev.
				His influence
					entertwined in the entire MB from beginning to end.
					He showed his skills in both shastra and then in shaastra.
				His ?Knowledge - could not answer Draupadi but answered all Yudhisthir's questions.
					He compiled Vishnu sahasranam. Millions of name.
						He spoke these while he had dried blood all over the body while lying on the bed of arrows.
						He was unclean externally but thru this he proved that he was internally clean.
					Bhishmovaca is simply wonderful in the epic in many places.
				His personality
					cuz he faltered with Draupadi disrobing, his decision brought difficulties to him and the pandavas.
						Vidura - she is different personality how can she be put on stakes.
						Draupadi also brings this
						Bhishma says - you talk dharma even in this situation is great. Then says that wife should be under husband's protection.
							why? If he would say that you are independent then connection with husbands would be denied
							then she would be non-protected woman.
							Also, slaves have no dignity - slavery is not there but mentality of slavery was there - we can do anything to her.
							His intention was that she should remain protected.
						Draupadi was seeking protection and not asking literal answer
							Bhishma didn't understand this but Jatayu understood Sita.
							Sita asked Jatayu to convey message but saw intrinsic ask for shelter or help.
							Jatayu didn't say - ok, I will tell, don't worry, you go.
							He lost cuz Ravan was young.
							Actually fighting and losing was not enough - sb reqd to tell Ram.
							Ram misunderstands Jatayu first.
							Medicine for your separation is with Ravan who has kidnapped.
						Instead of stopping Kauravas, he answered Draupadi - the answer which causes her greater trouble.
							He wanted to protect Draupadi from tag of unprotected woman.
							Hanuman - Shakti, buddhi, bhakti and tantra combination.
					repented for his action before his departure.
				His Parents
					Ganga - Purifier of e1 - who was born from feet of Lord Vishnu.
					Shantanu - who had the power to heal by his heavenly touch.
					Bhishma as vasu had crime of stealing milk and cow. But 1 did grievous so would suffer more.
					Drowning them was not killing them but taking them back to heavens.
					animal killing was not there - shantanu stopped animal killing.
					Bharadvaj - student of Valmiki and father of Drona
						different races and backgrounds and some soldiers consuming meat.
						He organized special kitchen for these - cooked meat of peacock, deer, rabbit.
						But did not consume personally.
						Vedas talk about not right and wrong but actions and consequence
						do you have capacity to handle the outcomes?
					How was polygamy allowed - we can't handle 1 but 7 can handle 5 - their action, consequence and capacities.
						why make 1 system appicable to all - all have different capacities.
						Can't tell Bhima to eat only 4 chapattis.
					Dynasty
						Pururava - then 18 generations.
						Bharat - Great emperor and then 4 generations.
						Hasti - Built hastinapur and then 10 generations.
						Kuru - then 4 generations.
						Shantanu and then Bhishma.
						MB tells lineage but these days family has become very isolated.
			Bhishma - life of unusual decisions.
				MCQ
					Fairness or kindness?
					Fairness and kindness.
					Kindness at the cost of fairness.
						this caused MB.
					Fairness at the cost of kindness.
				Being kind you give a cake but being fair you divide property mathematically.
				Bhishma continued to remain kind to all parties.
				Dhaumya was the teacher thru good and bad times - real substantial teacher.
					Drona was martial teacher and had agenda. Didn't visit during exile.
					But Dhaumya except in cognito he was always there.
					People don't know - cuz real teacher does not come in forefront.
					he helps students to grow - like Jambavan in Ramayan.
				Compassion to unqualified son to live stable life.
					in governance you can't do that.
					Duryodhan can't win empire so let him rule this and you develop khandav prastha - desert land.
					instead of execution of Duryodhan given kingdom after burning them.
			Material nature - bound to make mistakes.
				ordinary human when they get bad they get anti and start to blame God.
					But never blamed anyone but himself.
				proposed division of kingdom.
					Personal property can be divided but kingdom can't be divided cuz it's no1's personal property.
					foundationally wrong.
					king of kings is not owner but care taker.
				Shringi cursed king with some shatrik statements which are correct but not action.
					Kshatriyas like dogs guarding.
					Brahmins own but don't control and vv.
				St great personalities make wrong decisions.
					Like Arjuna also BG - right logic but decision is wrong.
					intention and action as much as is required for legacy.
					violence within beauty exists - vedas don't shy away from the duality nature of reality.
					Garden beauty while trampling insects and uprooting grass unknowingly.
					Hanuman leapt and beautiful sight but also note the violence.
					snakes coming outta mountain, tree uprooted, mountain throwing minerals.
					no1 can avoid these 2 - non-violence not always right and violence can't be avoided.
					pure being - such things don't exist in the world.
						Yudhisthir was ajat shatru - envy in others heart but he didn't cause it.
						don't hurt anybody - psychologically not possible.
				Bhishma tells to Yudhisthir and can write 100s of management books.
					practical perspective, etiquette perspective, scriptural perspective.
					there is no selflessness in love in this world including parental.
					some selfishness is there - this feels bad - cuz parental is closest to jiva and ishwar.
					The king is naradev but if doesn't take care of citizen then bring to public place and kill like mad dog.
					King should take care of child like mother carrying baby in womb.
				Truce of demigods and demons was short lived in samudra manthan.
					Yamunacarya - Ranganath - he would sit near feet and why not head cuz that's Duryodhan's side.
				What is it to be philosophical?
					Greek philosopher Plato says 2 things -
						Think clearly which is metaphysics.
						rule wisely which is politics.
					Some Vedantist over-emphasize the philosophical side.
						India was ruled cuz will of God.
						But there is also practical side.
						Human perspective makes you understand and learn.
						Ranganath - 12K brahmins slaughtered by Mani Kafir.
						Narratives - Krishna wanted to take them BTG - but also practical side that we gotta guard place as strongly as possible.
					Hanuman and Bhishma - hypothetical conversation used by Vaishnava to establish a point.
						I am not invited to serve the Lord
						Hanuman - no seva - Bhima - Krishna and Rama are same. Hanuman - but hard reality is that they are different.
						Hanuman - should I capture Duryodhan. No 13 years wait Yudhishthir says.
						Bhima describes what would happen if Hanuman would go to hastinapur like Lanka - asat sabha so that bad.
						for monkey you coming to me - not ordinary. Eventually, bhishma doing deity worship but would fight with hanuman.
						How can I fight you - I saved a woman and you let her be exploited although both are brahmacari.
						What can I do - neutrality will make you fight with Lord Krishna - shivering with the prediction.
						when philosophy of life and politics - ruled wisely - this makes Yudhishthir.
						1 should break vows like Krishna and keep like Rama.
							none of them caused problem to anybody.
			Bhishma's vision - isolated instead of integrated
				Did following
					Arranging the marriage of his father (reverse connection).
						A son cannot take the responsibility of a father.
					Vow of celibacy, i.e no kingship.
					Vyasa and his sister in law's sangama.
					Duryodhana was rewarded, instead of being punished.
					Kingdom was divided.
					Draupadi got neglected.
					Citizens were enraged, engaged and indifferent.
				Integration also causes conflict st but for short time.
					Actually his decision was strictly speaking not isolated.
					If king is not happy, how will he make praja happy.
					Therefore yatha raja, tatha praja but also vv. And also yatha praja, tatha raja.
					Compassion and magnanimity being unreasonable.
					Ram was compassionate but when questioned he said I can crush world under thumb so right to show such compassion.
					Great vow but blunder
						?Why great - celibacy is rare and that too for kshatriya and that too while living in kingdom.
						king captured by enemy then kid should not be kept in his place.
							only if son not qualified else don't sacrifice the kid.
							In this selfishness for the cause of the kingdom.
						This vow would be continuous trouble for the kingdom.
					Satyavati urged to get married but denied.
						Vow taken to avoid conflict, no emergency and no children - the vow became cause for later problems.
						marg vs gantavya - vow is marg but unfortunately became gantavya for him.
						We are not finding faults with Bhishma but learning lessons for our life.
						Many a times our upakaran becomes our upasana.
						Chanting is both means and goal - bead bag diksha beads is the instrument but not there, then do otherwise.
						Almost eb goes thru this.
						Should I do this or not is encountered by e1 - even postponing is also a decision.
					Niyog Paddhati - not allowed in kali yuga.
						vav lamba, offering flesh, procreating thru devar and taking sanyas.
						no access to their capacity and purity
					until prepare the consciousness, it will be counter productive said Vyasa.
						Force time to act b4 time - then can be counter productive.
						3rd generation - 125 years 1125 - it still stands - minimum for 1K years.
						vastu says home for 100 years and temple for 1K years.
					Flag supposed to be worshipped but immature citizens so lying on ground after world cup.
					Life is not involvement or abstinence but dealing with reality.
					A true devotee of the Lord is.
						Spiritually absorbed, politically alert, socially sensitive.
						Bhishma thought process - politically not very alert.
						He could fight Parashuram for 28 days.
						But Parashuram's vow to not kill marrying kshatriya, or surrounded by women - so 1 king called nari kavach.
						How Dashrath protected himself was getting married every time Parashuram came so 350 wives with 3 principal ones.
			Bhishma and Draupadi
				saw 2 alternatives -
					Widowhood - you are free - this makes her disconnect from the pandavas.
					Slavery - You belong to Pandavas - This makes her slave to the Kauravas.
				Lord expanded as sari some poets say.
				Krishna saw them as beggars - those who were appointed as king b4.
					very humbling and touching experience.
				Krishna said if I was there then I would stop them from playing gambling and if they insisted I would finish them off.
					The saree providing became secondary but what she went thru became primary - understand her emotions not her words.
					5 husbands with their gandiva, mace, greatness, medicine, future knower could not protect me.
					Krishna why you did not come - friend, devotee, not born ordinary and queen but even you didn't come.
					If you have deep relationship, then it's possible - even to be angry with Krishna.
					You can do anything but not good for us.
					can't cut relationship and curse Krishna.
				I vow that e1 responsible for this, e1 will see death after 13 years.
					Laws of nature may change.
					Philosophy giving when in trauma is violence - it's terrorism.
					It's truth but violent - greater then shooting with bullets.
					Facts kept in the corner.
					Vyasa tells that Draupadi was literally beggar in that state and offered only thing she could - tears.
					This is the water that Krishna asks for in BG not mineral water.
				Bhishma heard words but dhvani was not heard.
					what Draupadi needed - get protection.
					What Bhishma did - respond to the question.
			Bhishma and MB war.
				Plato is dear but dearer is truth.
				principle centric or person centric.
				panchals supported pandavas.
					in marriage alliance also - so natural for them.
					So panchals also settling scores with kuru - has to protect his own clan.
				cuz of his vow to Hastinapur.
					Dharma > Hastinapur. Dharma > Bharat.
						We call it bharat cuz bhav, raag, taal is in dharma.
						If Entire country becomes corrupt - it won't happen hopefully cuz of knowledge bank.
						Why spanish in South America - europe destroyed our civilization totally to the extent of our language.
						mayan uprooted from roots.
						Christian was middle east religion but adopted by Romans to that level.
						What religion were being practiced by Europe b4 christianity - b4 2K years.
						They got uprooted not just by force but by knowledge bank.
						not cuz born here but carefully study - 2K years. Greeks, mlecchas, hunas.
						Alexander realized that also fighting with the knowledge here.
						adharmik civilization then can leave says Chanakya.
						Not just how great you are but if stand against dharma then wrath of God.
					Truth will not make us rich but will make us free.
						Recognize, regret, reorganize, reunite.
						Try not have mundane master - cuz master takes away your time.
						When 7 says I don't have time - it is synonymous to I am bound.
						Free bird flies anywhere.
				will of God.
			Bhishma's character
				Saw limitations within (regret)
				Saw potentials in pandavas (satisfaction)
					Yudhishthir consciousness - repentant that for myself so many lives.
						vs us - Krishna ke liye kuchh bhi chalta hai.
					What are you thinking about - no contamination in him (may have made mistakes)
						Krishna tells Bhishma to teach Yudhisthir.
						But can't speak in front of sages and Krishna.
						Moon does its business but sun is sun and I want your signature on the words
						making Bhishma historically important from his teachings perspective.
						Bhishma closed all wounds and arrows coming out - he was devotee and also a yogi.
							left the body from brahma randhra.
				Thanked Sri Krishna (gratitude)
					His life was like Trishanku - worshipping Krishna in altar and then fighting him.
					withdrew all objects of thinking and only Krishna - after 58 days, focussed on Krishna he left.
			Krishna's vision
				Krishna saw fault in bhishma but not at the cost of his devotion.
					that's why shoot arrows at him.
					no1 is super human that no faults that's not possible.
				Krishna saw his devotion but not at the cost of seeing his faults.
					honest and sincere then Krishna comes to you either as arrow or himself.
				we have such personality to idolize, learn from and create legacy in our and others lives.
				Chanakya says following purposes of scriptures.
					Ramayan - teach how to live in this world.
					MB - teaches how to lead in this world.
					SB - how to love God.
					So, be alert, sensitive and absorbed.
		</Bhishma>
		<Yudhishthir>
		Yudhisthir - Catalyst of war.
			Application - Balance feminine and masculine morality.
			no enemy - ajatshatru - but many considered him as enemy.
			dharmo vivardhati yudhisthir kirtanena.
				whoever remembers yudhisthir, his intel in dharma will increase.
				whatever you associate with you become like them.
				Those who think how they were abused, become an abuser.
				many psychologists use this principle.
				Eg - Dhritarashtra born thru union full of fear.
				Eg - Duryodhan birth - late so mother smashed her womb in lamentation.
				Eg - Karna was unwanted cuz birth at wrong time.
				Eg - Drona - born of temptation and test.
				Eg - Bhisma - about to be drowned by mother and his father saved him by condemning her.
				Eg - Gandhari lived a life of blindness.
			Pandu curse so could not procreate - invoke presence of Lord Yama
				Dharma = yamaraj.
				why avatar? dharma samsthapanarthaya.
					avatar always applicable to Vishnu - cuz maintenance requires realignment.
						Veena or guitar not too tight or loose - right sound - too tight then breaks like Parashuram (Playing Lord Shiva)
						When Lord Narayana is without Lakshmi then becomes like Lord Shiva.
					dhama is embodied by Yudhisthir so Krishna came to establish Yudhisthir as the king.
				This resonates with Krishna's purpose of Dharma Samsthapana (and will eventually affect)
					SB 10th canto starts with when so many kings dressed as kings but were thieves.
					Narad Predicts Krishna's future activities
						that creator has descended to annihhilate Daitya, Pramatha and Rakshasa demons posing as kings
						and protect the godly.
						You will end king of cedi during Rajasuya.
						I see you appear as time personified, serving as Arjuna's chariot driver
							and destroying entire armies of soldiers to rid the earth of her burden.
					Krishna always thinking about Pandavas.
						Krishna saw devotees success from very beginning
						Draupadi Svayamvar - Krishna tells Balaram about Pandavas - but pandavas are dead said Balaram
						Krishna said that's rumor and that's best for them to stay as such.
					All avatars or Lord have weapons why
						Vishnu chakra and gada for bad and shankh and padma for good.
						Brahma doesn't have.
						Dhanavantri has leech in hand to suck bad blood.
					Masculine Morality and Feminine morality.
						Feminine morality is required for life, relationship and forgiveness.
						Masculine morality is required for systems, country and corporations.
						Even nostril has surya and chadra nadi - poetry, exam, creative, art, drama is chandra nadi or feminine side.
						passionate work then surya nadi - manage corporate, etc.
						cricketer tried yoga - kapha prakriti so accordingly I will tell.
							kapha prakriti - chalta hai na - if I can sit, then why stand.
								if peaceful then why fight with people.
							activate surya nadi then it will work for you so it has utility.
						The 2 moralities are mixed.
						The reference point is based on the need of the hour.
						Yudhisthir was looking for feminine morality.
					The reality of a peaceful life is war in regular intervals.
						not there must be but will be.
						If nothing outside then inside situation arises.
						China 10 years ago aborted 40 crore children in womb.
						Some say that revolution and renaissance, people have become civilized.
						But that's not truth. Tell me numbers.
			Yudhisthir too much bent towards feminine morality.
				Bhima - those who forgive are not taken seriously.
				no1 worships brahma have you seen said Bhima.
				People take him for granted. Other demigods are not.
			Rajasuya Sacrifice
				Father stuck in pitriloka so perform rajasuya
					Yudhisthir thought that means war and subjugation and that's not me.
					Narbali not recommended but 7 recommended this to Jarasandh and he started nripati bali.
				Parental affection that they would tell even military commander to take care.
				Krishna assured don't worry we will go beg for fight
					Yudhisthir cried that you will have to beg like Vaman.
					you are my heart and bros are my eyes - let them stay - don't worry.
				Shishupal changed narrative - he abducted Rukmini who wanted to marry me and you worship him a gvala.
					here he lost it and slandered much more than 100 so killed.
				Misunderstood prediction - After this yudhisthir concerned - Why this happened
					Vyas said after 13 years - kaal will use you as instrument for a devastating battle.
					what he heard was that he would be responsible.
					vow that I will never disobey superiors no matter what.
					st people say blindly follow authorities - externally it will not cause any conflict
					but eventually it will cause internal conflict which will manifest outside.
					With this vow - he took feminine morality - will follow therefore no problem.
				Don't keep guest for more than 3 days - trouble after that.
					Duryodhan still there and the maya mahal incident happened there.
					when arrogant person falls then laughter is natural - Draupadi laughed
					Yudhisthir stopped but Krishna said no problem and Bhima said blind's son blind.
					As revenge dice match arranged and invitation thru Dhritarashtra - who knew the Shakuni's plot of usurping.
			Dharma staked the essence of dharma to practice dharma of submission to superiors.
				That vow made him play gambling on advice of superiors.
					Another problem he was inquisitive about gambling but didn't play.
					This psychologically creates more infatuation.
					this vow so much so that gambled his wife also.
					Nala when proposed such thing had walked away in anger.
					Later on Yudhisthir said I act cuz I must.
					Draupadi asks why practice Dharma, Yudhisthir said I must not for fruit but the act itself.
				Yudhisthir had liking for gambling but no expertise.
					that's dangerous ?and eventually pulls one's idle curiosity
				immense adharma was created and none could change it other than avatar.
					but seeing what he did - how can we take him seriously.
					Evil side we understand. Bhima losing control can understand.
					Logic of MB is dharma when spreads adharma then it takes none other than avatar to rectify.
					That description shows him mad - Shakuni suggested and he described bodily limbs of Draupadi in assembly.
					He knew the politics of ethics but didn't respond quickly to the ethics of politics.
					He knew raja dharma but not raja tantra.
				Yudhisthir stand in 3 niti - brihaspati, shukra and kanik niti
					Yudhisthir was originally brihaspati and later became more practical.
					get power by any means.
					do dharma and establish dharma.
						who do you think will win against kanik niti.
					Yudhisthir says 2 parties fighting for land are like dogs fighting for piece of bone.
						he glorifies the path of giving up conflicts.
						Bhima suggests that if that's true, the tree, deers and rabbits should achieve perfection.
						Kunti sends message to Yudhisthir to act as per dharma - he argues that forgiveness is superior to discipline.
					Yudhisthir followed Brihaspati's ethics till gambling match, changed his ways following the event.
						idealism without practicality is as brutal as terrorism.
						as long as the hitler, stallion and cheating exist, people such as Gandhi, Buddha or Jesus will only become martyrs or create other martyrs.
						Many environmentalists write India as land of Buddha and Mahavir but seldom write it as a land of Rama and Krishna.
							that's not right narrative - we certainly need feminine ethics but not at cost of masculine ethics.
							at social level - it gives you more and more injustice. Good for personal bhajan but not social system - that's violence.
							Ashok's non-violence is glorified
							Arjuna outside without Buddha inside is Hitler.
							1 thinker says that Buddhism's acceptance in royalty was problem.
							to an extent that sushrut's surgery stopped cuz violence to animals.
								cuz of that practice the passing of that knowledge stopped and finished off.
						at personal level, feminine ethics (personal level goodness ethics) can be great and take you closer to perfection
							but not necessarily good for social perfection - that needs masculine ethics (passion requiring ethics - face offs related)
							dharma is not rule centric but narrative centric.
							Dharma is not static but dynamic.
					Shukra niti is do dharma or adharma to establish dharma.
			?Krishna wanted Yudhisthir to be king cuz dharma samsthapanarthaya
				Krishna had annihilated most of powerful demoniac kings who were outright demons in guise of rulers.
					Kamsa, Jarasandha, ekalavya, salva, narakasura, bhaumasura, sisupal.
					No question whether to kill kamsa - killing children, imprisoning relatives father, sister, etc.
					Jarasandh - no confusion.
					Ekalavya - many have. As demoniac as Jarasandh.
						can't play caste arrow - cuz Krishna was yadav and Ekalavya was son of king.
						Krishna btw had buffalos also which Yashoda would use to make sweets. Tells Rupa G.
					narakasura - had kidnapped 16K girls so no confusion.
				However the problem was in hastinapur - which was the epicenter of politics.
					greatest powers were centralized in Hastinapur.
					Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Bahallika, Bhurisrava.
					Shalya, Kripa, Kritavarma, Shakuni.
					How was shalya bad - he was very ambitious - if Duryodhan become king and not very good at rule, I can eventually be independent.
						but pandavas win - then nice rulers and I will have to be subordinate to them.
						that's why reception of Duryodhan became big deal to him. He came with agenda.
				So, raja tantra - battle was not between outrightly dharmik and adharmik persons.
					BG to not kill Duryodhan and party.
						but the giants Bhishma, Drona, etc - the establishment of dharma isn't that easy.
					offering respects and finding secrets to kill greatest of opponents.
					Lying to eliminate Drona.
					Was it all worth it?
						First, it's difficult and second, yes (more on it later cuz this was the question of yudhisthir also)
						@Police to kill outright murdered is no big deal but if become person of good intentions accidentally.
						Eg - I was in jail - not as prisoner but to teach.
							300 murderers to be lectured - they will be other side of the bars - no they will sit in front.
							My god they have experience and can easily do with me also.
							Prayed to Krishna and reminded of what makes a person do bad even knowing its wrong.
							After interaction, except 4-5 of them, most were circumstantial murderers.
							pious people who in anger murdered.
							1 of greatest kirtans.
							Jailer said he has done 3 and 6 from him.
			Yudhishthir exemplifies - Importance of yoga in the world (be in but not of the world)
				?practically balance all the roles with right focus.
					Being lotus is very difficult - detached from the world is easy.
					Krishna is teaching yoga - don't give up and don't get attached but be there - balance life.
					You are there but not there is the yoga.
					Those who can balance spiritually, intellectually, personally, socially they become Arjuna.
				So, BG doesn't teach war - it teaches that st life is difficult that you gotta deal like Arjuna.
					or 7 has to deal cuz you are the Bhishma in that situation.
					not cruel but tough decisions need to be taken - easy to be anger but crying and shooting Bhishma isn't easy.
					To tell lie isn't difficult but for person who has never told lie has to lie to beloved superior to kill him is not easy.
				5 married to Draupadi circumstantially thru Kunti's words and benediction informed by Vyasa.
					Kaam arose - not lust but desire (iccha) - Yudhisthir said we all should marry - shocked Kunti
						cuz it has come to my mind so it can't be adharma.
						can anybody have guts to say this.
					shastra wants us to be that empowered.
						we want 7 to take responsibility of our decisions.
						cuz they they told so their responsibility - no!! They suggested and you chose.
						Your choice and your repercussions.
						So, shastra wants us to be empowered to take decisions not recklessly but with empowerment.
			Yudhisthir's Transformation
				balance of buddhism and shukra niti that asked secrets to kill the greatest opponents.
					Transformation of Yudhisthir - he learnt the art of changing or transforming.
					My yoga teacher - Shirshasan is not circus balance but balance your mind and the body - the 2 are related.
					this is a changed Yudhisthir with feminine and masculine morality.
				Eg - Greatest pain offerable to Duryodhan is to show compassion to him - Bhima agreed.
					So saved from Gandharvas.
				Why Krishna chose Yudhisthir (transformed one) over other pandavas
					cuz philosophically strong and his tantra had changed.
				Eg - The idea of Shalya provoking Karna was given by Yudhisthir - so very smart guy after this transformation.
					He gets provoked and agitated easily Yudhisthir knew.
					Some think that Karna's provocation would not let him succeed in Draupadi svayamvar.
					Imagine Arjuna who came as Brahmin and therefore ridiculed by all others (Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc all but Krishna)
					This made Arjuna stronger.
					he prospers in challenging situations.
					In stage Karna performs well but in life it's Arjuna.
					Later it became habit of Shalya - Karna also used to condemn.
				Eg - 9th day Arjuna could not do immediately.
					Krishna rushed to kill Bhishma - no problem I will do it.
					Bhishma tells the secret and Shikhandi is woman only.
					those who resemble like woman, name like woman, in last lifetime, I don't fight.
					Shikhandi was not on rath but in front - armor for Arjuna.
			Yudhisthir asked if it was all worth it - crores of people died
				life of 36 years as king and 60 years of Parikshit afterwards and then again kali comes.
				even 1 day of dharma is worth it.
					And for 100 years so many people would perfect their lives
					?and destiny is from results of action not action themselves
					Material stability in dharma makes one inclined to spirituality
						poverty does not and great suffering does not make philospher else e1 in hospital would be - they become atheist or agnostic.
						Philosophy vs facility
							Easy to speak that suffering for lives as many hair on the cow.
							They don't even have water - you are already adding salt to their injury.
							Rather than philosophy - give them facility.
							pehle pet puja fir gopal ki puja - ironically it is true.
					BG - not spoken to make Arjuna philosopher but use philosophy for leading a life - it's just a tool.
						but unfortunately philosophy becomes goal.
						Krishna spoke it to engage him in positive action.
						for 100 years ahead, people would see BG practiced and get inspired and create a legacy.
						Krishna establishes mentality of ownership - BG should be seen lived and not only heard.
						If they would not win - BG will remain theoretical.
						Where is my food will become the center of life.
					During Duryodhan's time - education, cow protection, etc fell apart.
						If woman of stature of Draupadi could be abused, what of others.
						Legacy of violence and injustice and that would become lifestyle of people for generations.
						People would start believing in adharma as lifestyle.
					So, congratulate Yudhisthir for becoming king.
						Need to take care of family - this legacy comes from far off sources.
						Stay buddha internally but warrior externally.
						Krishna spoke BG to pandavas and SB to his next generation - without them we won't have these 2 important books.
						May pandavas legacy remain.
					7 coming to hear about Krishna is rare and should be thanked for coming and hearing.
		</Yudhishthir>
		<Vyasa>
		Vyasadev - The unbiased historian and neutral participant
			Application - An unbiased neutral participant.
			Vyasa historian thought as community - cuz 1 could not do it being so huge effort.
				They misquote - Manu Samhita - this person is collection of many vyasas but literary incarnation.
				We forget divinity of Vyasadev.
					avajananti maam mudha - divine considered mundance and can't happen - reduce scripture to your level of reality instead of raising your own level to level of scripture.
			Vyasa Pitha - Vedike - Legacy
				Tyagi - dedication - vasistha was great grandfather.
					Vishvamitra caused trouble but maintained non-violence.
				Samarpan - Surrender - Shakti
					Shakti - dedicated for the cause of demigods in the fight with Vishvamitra.
				writer - Kritikar - Parashar
				compiler - sangrahakar - Vyasadev.
				kathakar - speaker - Sukadev.
			vyasa purnima irrespective of your parampara.
				such terms come from his contribution.
				Veda garbha - knowledge of universe is same as srishti cuz manual - it is revealed and provable.
					Rishis became 1 with knowledge - we are redundant but knowledge is fresh.
					7 Rishis are not same but changing - limitless actually across universe and even inside.
					Shruti is principle and Smriti is application that's 1 understanding.
					REL Writing happens thru experience when shruti how to do kitchen but when never done then written down.
					2000 BC, MB was written - it's possible shruti and smriti is recurring concept.
				?Vyasa vs common historians
					He would stay in home as much as the time is required for milking a cow - very less.
					MB is life darshan - Responsible Vyasa himself - participant and writer.
						Vyasa asks what he could do - Draupadi had lost eth. Subhadra lost children. Kunti suffering mistreatment to Karna.
						All DAKM in life but conclusion is moksha or liberation or prema.
						he is also participant in MB - neutral but seeing pain he would go there.
						He is divine and also human in MB.
						But not attached in the story.
						Gandhari gonna curse so he rushes to Gandhari.
						He is not audience in the movie - not a contributor as audience - he is a contributor.
					rights without responsibility become abuse.
						Responsibility without rights also gives abuse to oneself.
						we need rights with responsibility.
						Great house parampara? - greater is given, greater is expectation.
							like sat yuga - think bad has consequence cuz given a lot and high expectations.
							death penalty even after heinous crimes in kali yuga so eth is slowed and delayed.
			Janma
				born in middle of jamuna island so called dvaipayana.
				grew up instantly - MB doesn't talk about his education.
				Parashar took Vyasa with him. He didn't stay with his mother.
					People don't wanna part from child cuz later don't know and belief comes true.
					But then, sent to get culture and training.
				He came to mother or parents whenever required.
					they were all sensitive.
				Amba Ambika informed about upcoming conflict and had gone with Vyasa.
			History and Itihas
				History - winners or losers - who writes it.
					There's big debate about this happening since modern education has systematized.
						narrative presented - slendering not huge but a slow poison.
						Winners write more than what good they did and hiding evilest acts.
						Losers eventually write how they were brutalized by the winning country.
					Losers can also make history with apt historians.
						Eg - there is so much written about American civil war losers.
					Historians.
						They make you appear refined and classy in your brutality and violence.
						They make you appear magnanimous and large hearted in your destructive and cruel act.
						They make you appear charitable when you are charlatan.
						They make you appear scientific and progressive in your blindness and stupidity.
						Many history writers are like makeup men who make dead body have a lasting smile
							even though person must have never smiled in his entire life.
					Thus, true history is buried in the lies of prejudice of both the winners and loser parties.
						History has natural prejudice.
							cuz we are covered by our MMN.
						dharma is defined by 1 in power says Bhishma to Draupadi and it's in their hands.
						Kunti telling about Karna to Vyasa - worried not about results but action itself.
							Surya was about to curse 1 who gave benediction, family, etc.
						Powerful by tapasya, repentance, responsibility - can digest eth. You were young and innocent.
							judgement not by action alone but consciousness behind action also.
				itihas means iti+ha+asa - thus verily happened.
					it's different from history.
					means history as it truly happened.
					this is what happened, happens and will happen is the spirit.
					word can't be translated unless that concept exists in that tradition.
					SP said the difficulty is we gotta use foreign language - not he didn't know but that language is limited.
					There is no avatar in that world. incarnation - coming back to flesh.
					Christianity is once and flat and not circular.
					Abrahamic faith has no name for God only. But in Vedas we have 1K names - limitless activities.
					Krishna - how much greatness shall I tell you - 40 mins cuz fighting gotta do.
					God is not same as bhagavan.
				Differences
					History is narrative based on facts
						but itihas is meant to narrate the darshan of life thru impacting life.
						finding fault with your own country also is a prejudice - gotta see as it is - tattva-darshi.
						History has always been boring subject cuz it has lacked truths and life.
					Valmiki and Vyasa and other rishis create impact.
						vs other historians create facts - some real and other fabricated.
						eg - yes 1857 happened would be true but capturing the complete mentality won't be captured properly.
					without itihas we never understand life in totality.
						jivan darshan is the purpose of valmiki and vyasa.
						Raghuvanshan, Abhijnanashakuntalam - creates a character by Kalidas
						But vyasa describes shakuntala as she represents a psychology to make an impact in lives.
						Don't get stuck in proving character but focus on characteristics - vyaktitva is more important to us than Vyakti.
					Oriental institute research conducted - to separate fictional verses from MB
						who gave them this assignment and even right to do this.
							Their PhD degree, college, funders.
						vs Rishi means drishya - means the seer
							the power of seeing so deep that my answer does not stop here
							1 layer of reality has more depth.
							you questions start becoming greater.
							REL Read BG next time - deeper understanding they say cuz of this.
							word has an idea not just meaning.
					Respect for their Jeevan darshan and time factor making things mature
						After 20 years garland making has become a siddhi - fascinating combinations of malas over time.
							God's grace, disposition of humility and time factor (paripakva made by time).
							we impose perfection ignoring time factor - it's only ignorance, arrogance and foolishness.
						Jeevan darshan how much they spent - without limits.
						Eg
							this is a garland - compiling bhagavat, upanishads is also an art.
								The idea was to serve.
							Mother has cooked for 40 years and you try - nowhere close for sure.
								Let it cook for as long as it has to become.
							pickle isn't made in an hour.
							80 years to took the hastinapur kingdom for pandavas - even if they had Krishna.
						I want to write book now trying to become Vyasa
							artist trying to make ganapati ended up making monkey cuz no capability.
						Getting sold in colleges is very easy cuz we want success.
						Devs should hunt for rhinos - but are we devs?
						Turban - expertise is there but eventually - 98% times dissatisfied.
							Now imagine Vyasa after doing eth felt dissatisfied - can't compare with mundane.
							Vyasa's standard was so high that even if vedas had words of Krishna but still looking for more.
							After hari katha if you feel satisfied then not good - show greed that it was not enough.
							Like businessman - no matter how you earn you wanna earn more.
						Purana means stay fresh thru jivan darshan.
					Qualifications of Vyasadev and Valmiki
						Sponsored by no one - not sold.
							you are bound to become their servant and invite their energy.
							that's why brahmins stay independent so that go deep into something.
							independence not based on arrogance. They had humility.
						sheltered by tapasya.
							SP - 12 years anything you get perfection. Shaili changes.
								Zakir hussain plays like machine. Sachin's game - divinity in that opulence.
								Man is not God but God stays inside man.
							Not just writing 1 lakh verses but transformational verses.
								when they say that he was committee that should increase our respect for him.
						sheltered by yoga.
							also with kala prakriti, MMN, jiva and interactions - sensitised to all this is also yoga darshan.
							practical about Parikshit - elements merged with respective elements - the elements are not destroyed but displaced the energy from different parts can be brought together.
							This chair could have been someone's body or bathroom's commode - it's the elements of nature.
						sheltered by dharma
							sb gives more than you have acquired you feel insecure.
								these sages have nothing to lose - fear of losing when you think it belongs to you.
								Gauranga Pr's parents - what did we do wrong that he left us.
								when they got answer they also joined
						sheltered by satya.
							st in biases can't speak satya cuz sold out to some party.
							Valmiki said accept Sita - I take vow that she is pure and accept her.
								this episode happened in Naimisharanya.
								he said this during 1 yajna.
								For person who knows value of satya to take vow like so is very significant.
						follow the legacy of rishi parampara.
							Narad blessed their work after they had started.
								thru SP books and lectures we just connect to Narad and Vyasa
					Suffering is temporary principle but ananda is eternal principle.
						by changing perspective changes eth - spiritual world is consciousness says SP.
			His character is udasin - udasin is not neutral - ut + asin - sitting on top.
				writers but also participant both Vyasa and Valmiki.
				Characteristics of Neutral people
					Neutral is the person who always leans towards the powerful.
					Does not flatter them but unconsciously adore them.
					Do not stand for the oppressed - gives them philosophy of inner life.
					//Neutral people don't take sides cuz sides keep changing.
				Eg - Vyasa taking responsibility for Parikshit
					2 brahmastra collide then 12 years of drought.
					Only a brahmacarya power could withdraw it and Arjuna did.
					Ashvatthama said that he can't withdraw but only direct it.
					I can direct it to womb of Uttara - Vyasa says so be it. Why?
					cuz 12 years of drought claiming millions of lives vs 1 life.
					Vyasa knows that Draupadi was told that all will die but 1 will survive that that tested guy would be parikshit.
				Eg - Not taking responsibility
					French queen said don't have bread then eat cake.
			Warriors of knowledge
				Vyasa able to guide and take tough decisions like Parikshit
					cuz knew and did dharma so he could do what had to be done.
				Left liberal - separate hindus from brahmins.
					conscious effort then communities can be separated out.
					Some say bad people but their religion isn't bad.
					Others say that bad religion but good people in there.
					they don't stand by customs, attires, etc cuz that's the mental programming.
					this is all bogus and bad - narratives are subtle.
				facts vs impacts
					MB and Ramayan being jivan darshan are bound stay relevant.
					Rishis - those who see movements in life and no subjective experiences.
					Heavenly surrounding vs depressing. Not experience as truth of life but view of life (drishti-kon)
				Nivritti have no experience of life but talk idealistic.
					This conflict of idealism and practicalism also exists.
					kavyatmak drishtikon and another has anubhav.
					but these personalities had both.
					So it's aparadh to see exalted people at same level as others.
			What they made outta their life - Samajik samanta vs samajik nyaya.
				give opportunity to e1 - not e1 but those who can handle it.
				else wastage of resources.
				has potential but poverty sticken then help but not cuz he is poor.
				Qualifications of Vyasa - son of parashar and fisherwoman.
				Valmiki - learnt mara since birth.
					can make distinction of good and bad is a journey to start off.
				Mrigari - killing half and full - so desensitised to understand the pain of others.
					If you are killer then try to minimize the pain.
				varna is merit centric and jaati is reservation centric.
				They see Arjuna more that character or person but personality or vyaktitva
					story of Arjuna but also principles in that personality.
					Ramayan will exist as long as srishti - unchanging principles of life - greatest cheating is where there is greatest vulnerability with relatives.
					Faith and no vyavahar so greatest cheating around religion.
				Rama checking if Bharat was happy in Ayodhya - had faith but practicality added to it.
					Pandavas - Married to life then make a rule - they had faith.
					When legalized then even bound by yamaraj and kingly rule.
					Anushasan parva become necessary - demigods are witness so no need of legal but later legal becomes more important.
					Manthara was not heard just once but consistenly - Rafale chori hai eg.
						lie repeated enough times.
						Bharat said mother you never understood me.
					if we don't understand history, we repeat it.
					Philosophy and darshan are not the same word - no word for darshan.
						cuz philosophers are intelligent but not rishi.
						sadhana and tapasya.
						darshan and sudarshan - see rishi darshan else see sudarshan or kaal chakra.
					Gandhi made Indian father - for country more than 5K years old and people accept.
						these rituals accepted cuz not centered on Vyasa and Valmiki.
						Jarasandha consciousness - destroy kings - capitalism mentality - destory newbies to stay powerful.
			Impacting following
				Birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu.
					Bhishma had vow greater than legacy of bharat-varsha.
						niyog paddhati - not allowed in kali - even legally.
						if kshetra is same and seed from qualified source then child belongs to that family.
						Shiva is virupaksha - difficult to see but not ugly.
					Vyasa told that eth should be given time but no we can adjust mentally.
						KT given to ladies but still training mind takes time.
					Some can handle chillis easily - body also has characteristics.
						nut allergy - same nut becomes poison if different.
						she closed her eyes in fear - instead of welcoming.
						Dhritarashtra - 1K elephant strength, insight of life cuz vedas but closed eyes so blind.
						So garbhadan sanskar is so powerful - even Vyasadev so powerful but blind power.
						Grace of god without my efforts and endeavor gives blind power.
						Guru powerful and jiva potent - fully best on both sides then purush prakriti meet well.
						Jiva sankalpa done - that I want to do bhakti - God does not help.
						God can do anything but he doesn't do anything.
						He is more loyal to his laws.
						Was vyasa responsible for Dhritarashtra to be born blind.
					Go to ambika after ambalika.
						Her body turns pale. Child was powerful but some disease he got.
						Capacity and determination - 00, 01, 10, 11.
					They had determination but didn't have the capacity to handle Vyasa.
						3rd time - Dasi - she had courage, culture, capacity and determination - ability to handle the unexpected.
							procreated thru her and you are no more a dasi - sakshat yamaraj will appear - very important personality.
							Vyasa willing to give and she willing to take.
							Similarly Vyasa is willing to give knowledge thru MB and are we willing to take.
							Grace of Vyasa and Greatness of mother made Vidura.
				Making 100 Kauravas
					Gandhari still pregnant - she did tapasya for child to take birth.
					paap vritti for small time that my child won't be the king.
					miraculous power - divided embryo and children made 100.
					Here brahmins could not say what the signs said.
					Discard the child said Vidura.
				Taking his mother and Ambalika and Ambika.
					Vyasadev did his part and not responsible to what they do with it.
					St listen to mother and st tell.
					This place will see limitless conflict and stay with me.
					But he would himself participate to educate and enlighten them.
				Marriage of Pandavas.
					Vyasa always hints in astrology - else we live in their story and don't work hard for it.
					God's will and take it for granted and don't work - only after work is done and result comes that is what we call as coming from Krishna.
					After Vyasa said Draupadi's past life but still it became background for pandavas and not deiciding criteria.
					They still struggled - meant for Arjuna as per Drupada. Arjuna thinking can't marry b4 elders. Kunti's words.
					It has come in my mind - this can't be sinful.
					no1 can dare to say this.
					Drupad also complained but Vyasa explained to him and he agreed.
					Vyasa, Narad, Krishna approved the marriage. Entire kurukul marriage - why should we object.
					especially after their credibility demonstrated over years of togetherness.
				Approving Rajasuya sacrifice.
					Yudhisthir avoiding Rajasuya for parents who were stuck in pitriloka.
					He welcomed sage guidance that he would suggest to avoid conflicts - Vyasa told otherwise.
					Bhima also defeated karna during that time.
					Least mistake then better yajna.
				The prediction of war during Rajasuya.
					Shishupal did more gaali than the mantras.
					the obstacles didn't stop - Vyasa said they would exist for 13 more years.
					and this would end after making you cause (not responsible) for destroying all asuras in kings dress.
					tolerate always isn't a principle for all times.
					Bharat was yogya so it could be given but not with Duryodhan.
					His vow would cause problem which was heard by Duryodhan and attacked them.
					Karna - best time to strike them while they are weakest - no army, weak, etc.
						this is kaal that Krishna repeats this at the time of his death.
					Vyasa - man doesn't improve but ask others also.
						see exalted people are not proud.
				Warning to Dhritarashtra about ill behavior.
				Death of Abhimanyu - Yudhisthir disturbed.
					Don't lament cuz on mundane platform he has had glorious death.
					Personal destiny of Abhimanyu.
					Generic destiny of eb - Reality of death should be accepted.
					Pacified but what to tell Arjuna. Just listening philosophy immediately doesn't show change but overtime.
					Vyasa also explained to Yudhisthir what to do.
					People say we don't need satsang - it makes such a difference.
					Pandavas could have walked away even after all the injustice.
					So especially good people need it more than bad.
					Krishna gives anugita but does not repeat BG.
						Arjuna said he forgot so give again.
						Vyasa has the contribution to give it to us.
						LCM said those who don't follow Vyasa's text and practice mental concoctions only vinash at personal and social level.
						70% of class 6th can't solve maths but get certs - how much India will change if we have ideals of Vyasa.
				Showing Gandhari life as it is on the battlefield.
				Pacifying Dhritarashtra
				Pacifying Kunti.
		</Vyasa>
		<Dhaumya>
		Dhaumya - Power without position.
			Application - Power without position.
			People so conspicuous by his humility.
				He is there but so much kept in background that not spoken about so much.
				Student gets a feeling of learning himself but such ambience of training for student confidence.
				Like Jambavan - Hanuman's glory brought out by him - where to go and what to bring.
					Going to lanka.
					even bringing mountain.
					Jambavan never says I told him to bring mountain.
					He contributes in such a way that don't make hanuman to say about it.
			Purohit concept
				Purohit = puru or puri + hit - the well wisher of family or city.
					literally there is no different between family priest and SM.
					Sages, saints and brahmins were especially meant for such functions.
					Thinktank - only 1 project - upgrading the knowledge of people - fully dedicated to uplift.
						opinion presenting and they are free to choose.
						Vow to be a guide.
						Dronacarya was open about fighting against Drupad and never comes to meet Pandavas in forests.
						vs Dhaumya always by there side so the 2 are not comparable.
				Purohit word is misused in current times.
				the purohit also prays for his own growth cuz he is giving so much of his personal time to specific family.
			First Meeting
				Gandharva told our land - Ganga land belongs to e1 says Arjuna and defeated - gifted chariot.
					You don't have purohit and no1 progresses without.
				Dhaumya tells about bharatvarsha with rivers like ganga, and all.
					this destroys the idea that India is a new nation concept.
					He doesn't talk about Nile river and all.
					He talks about the 4 directions.
					Tells about rules for pilgrimage - not for food, old age suffering, sanyas body weak, sweet eating, etc.
					They honestly told that they could not go
					they didn't say that Krishna will take care (st sign of immaturity)
					On recommendation Yudhisthir many sages got back into kingdom.
					Dhaumya accepted cuz if I serve such committed people - it will serve society at large.
				Once accepted he would stay with Pandavas in their good and bad times.
					similar to secretaries to the PM but post PM there not people.
					Eg - 1 person wanted to chant at 40 being kula parampara.
						Teacher told that they are to be chanted and not analysed. They reveal with time.
						They become vedbhashi over time - their way of speaking itself changes.
						whatever they say becomes true.
						Once accepted, when disciple could not go cuz of bodily issues, guru went to disciple being committed.
					Likewise not a decorative post but commitment.
				Their identity as pandavas had to be hidden so only during in cognito he had to leave - mantras of blessing so that no1 will be able to find.
					Kripa was kulguru of kurus and Dhaumya for Pandavas.
					cuz of association of Duryodhan Kripa would eventually even become a warrior on the field.
					Kripa would even assist Ashvatthama in the slaughter.
			Pandavas were permitted to hunt in forests
				Modern psychology to release your internal energy - this is shastik also.
					Pandavas used to do fight practice.
					takiya markar. Stand in front of mirror.
					Better mantras - shanti mantra.
					Kshatriya so gotta keep the spirit of punishing miscreants alive
						else they would become so brahminical that will start forgiving outta weakness.
					takes great courage to discipline.
					So would go to forest.
					Also the wild animals can attack the villages and farmland.
						so to keep the population balanced.
						when too much depleted they pleaded Yudhisthir for population control and he complied.
			After the asat sabha insult - the picture depicts them
				Yudhisthir face covered cuz of glance would cause fire.
				Arjuna scattering dust, Bhima looking shoulders.
				Nakula and Sahadev covered with dust. Draupadi with open hair.
				Dhaumya chanting sama sukta mantras with kusha grass (symbolizing weapon) invoking yama.
				sand indicating arrows. Dust to not recognize and no1 to be attracted to them.
				Open hair to tell society what they are in.
				Yama to be called after death - destination is stuck otherwise.
				Dhritarashtra told about this picture - thus foreshadowing what's coming.
			?Dhaumya worked for relationship not money
				?Current consciousness is money centered.
				Communists made e1 poor and thus narrow mindset.
				   Consciousness only I me and today. can't think of higher reality.
				Modern society is threatened society of losing jobs.
					no1 can do anything anytime - relationship is based on your competence and productivity.
					relationship has become tool for achieve something.
					vs old times - relationship is goal and eth is util.
				no personal wealth - eth belongs to master - not to ensure exploitation.
					psychology is why should I worry about funds when master is taking care of me.
					verse without surrounding consciousness becomes a deadly poison.
					no money with ladies cuz her money belongs to her husband but can't quote it in modern times cuz values and MMN have changed.
					st religious people quote shastra without context.
					shastra are so dynamic and powerful that without context they can cause problems.
					Yes, it is true that poor then good qualities are destroyed.
					that's why - Only grihastha has right to tell how to live in the world cuz he has.
				Education system not money centered - You study vedas and we will help you - Ayurveda, etc - vidya should be done free of cost and be supported.
					Money centeredness and children become costly - expend on their expenditure - whole system becomes money conscious.
					UKG - Education sold in Kg.
			Akshay Patra Origin
				80K people had come with Yudhisthir outta commitment.
					Lost kingdom but not charitable disposition - I gotta give them.
					People answer based on logic not thinking.
					Dhaumya meditated and said sun takes juice from earth.
						see sun in grains and vv - cuz its energy.
				Invoke surya for akshay patra
					in heart of sungod narayan resides so surya narayan.
					Also see narayan in anna also.
					don't see Krishna only in my temple, deity or bead bag.
					108 names of sungod who appeared and gave akshay patra.
					pot made of grass.
					For us akshay patra is earth or bhumi devi.
					Show affection towards earth and cows - prema and vijnana and it became akshay patra.
					akshay patra in their consciousness - easy to find them - see where the opulence is.
				?Earth also follows ye yatha maam
					makki roti and sarson saag in amritsar - the taste stays on tongue.
					make soap outta ghee but kitchen does not have it.
					you develop relationship with earth - it starts to open up.
					hiding resources by mother when son is squandering like Vena.
					Prithu saw that earth was holding back - their complaint is bona fide.
					Respect, shelter and love and she started giving.
					Akshay patra gave unlimited blessings to pandavas and Satrajit jewel caused death.
			Guru Disciple Qualifications
				Very 1st verse of Ramayan describes the quality of guru and shishya.
					tapasya, svadhyaya, vak tattva cuz reciting vedas
					Valmiki - is muni pungava; he was equally tapasvi.
				Guru qualifications
					Siddham Satsampradaye - knowledge in legacy.
					Sthiradhiyam - even though the knowledge is coming from parampara,
						but the student (teacher) should have focus and attentive mind with shraddha.
						Guru parampara is contribution of vedic life.
						even Krishna says even rishis say - quoting auth and purvaja (born earlier)
						they don't become flow but be a part of the flow.
						ritvik philosophy as last guru then affected by abrahamic process of 1 guru.
						from vedas perspective it should flow.
					anagham - free from contamination or towwards that journey.
						there is no limit to purity cuz dealing with para brahma who is supreme pure.
						Rupa G - you start realizing your limitations the closer to reach to Krishna.
						Never perfect cuz in perfection you improve.
					shrotriyam
						the teacher should regularly study the vedas cuz that's the root.
						Rishi hunkar and shastra arrows in all direction - these 2 combinations indicate dharma stabilizing.
						vak siddhi - why do they say take blessing from brahmins.
							cuz tapasya over years. Their words have power - in touch with recitation of vedas.
							what of rishis even experts of any line - their words have power.
							that's why don't make seniors upset with us.
							you are sploit and he becomes that. gaya guzra hai.
							Let them speak auspicious words - vidya, aishvarya mile.
							affirmations mantra these days same concept.
							shanti mantra
							blessings has become old fashioned these days.
							Comedians every 2nd line is cuss word only.
							Rupa G tells grass the cow and walk around forest.
							Rajasuya - Dhaumya seva of organizing other sages for yajna.
								Krishna - I will wash feet of atithis - kings and sages - they should not use bad words so good words.
								the bad words enough to destroy the pandavas.
								even when wrong - it works. Gandhari's curse words actually worked cuz Krishna wants it to work.
					Brahmanistham
						He needs to understand first by his own faith in the process and on the supreme.
						Otherwise, what's the point of vedas.
					Sattvastvam
						being situated in sattva, food, thoughts, and association.
						annamaya kosh - good food, music, smell, colorful clothes are all inputs - MOG be in all of them.
					Satyavacam
						He should be uncompromising in presenting satya.
						He should not sell his soul for popularity.
						We can use shastra to misuse shastra - like woman who earns forgets her master and such strong words OR brahmin should not earn.
							while that's true but not to hurt people but transform people.
							truth and kindness should be together.
						Near Gokarna - good locality - vedic guy said vibrations not very good.
							europeans go there - he informed without hurting her - not you, but the surrounding vibrations not good.
							She used to smoke and drink there.
					samayaniyataya sadhu vrattya sametam.
						He should choose for his sustenance - based upon VA principle.
						and according to the time, place, circumstances without compromising the principle (an amazing point!)
						Grihastha brahmin so where to take shelter - dakshina from sources.
						Brahmins and kshatriyas in emergency can be paid.
						But had taken job in Virat kingdom and didn't beg.
					dambhasuyadi muktam
						free from competition and glory.
					jita vishaya ganam.
						keeping the senses within the limit.
					dhirgha bandhu - affection for students should be sustained.
						older school - teacher would remember 4K students. Will come and must meet teachers.
					Compassion centric - this is the way to express love.
					svyalite shashitaram
						love should be flavored with discipline, when required.
						SP - if you don't have a teacher who can chastise you, you don't have a teacher only.
					sva para hita param
						the acarya wishes for both for himself and his student the highest benefit.
						big celebrations also - not much masti mazak - respectful distance between father and child - tough love.
						only internal - no extra jubilation or lamentation with results.
						Mother not making child feel that I love and father is yamraj like they do these days.
						Parents want to prove that I am more dear to you.
						outdo affection in front of others - using both of them - child gets spoilt.
						Maintain gravity so that success does not go into brain.
						In name of well wisher, teacher can't forget his own sadhana.
						never talk the language of martyrs - I will lay down for you - no. You grow and I grow.
							Guru tattva is plural - he should deal with all my problems - not information without atmiyata like google.
							you learn the art of applying the knowledge - he also makes you man of wisdom. jnana and vijnana.
							not flat questions to eb but change its flavor and get different views.
							Good QA then speaker, listener and audience all benefit.
				qualifications of student
					sadbuddhi - he knows the purpose of learning and benefits others.
						teaching is art of teacher.
						westerns keen to learn at banaras but purpose was appropriate the knowledge and misuse it like rakshasas - misuse like miscommunicate to destroy faiths.
						shabda kosh intended to convert to christianity.
						earlier this was understood by teacher and denied wisdom - you don't have sense control and hence I can't give.
						Eg - Drona didn't give brahmastra to even his own son and karna.
							later becomes week on zidd and gives it half way.
							karna came to parashuram - ambitious to get brahmastra and disguised - disguise is done by robbers or cheaters.
					sadhusevi - serving the sadhus.
						Power to digest what you learn.
					samuchita charitah - develops good characters by such sangha.
					tattva bhodabhilashi.
						understand the difference between shreyas and preyas.
					susrusuh - look for great teacher, serve him and wait for him to teach him.
						can't force to teach you.
						When shukadev goes to meet Janak M - he had to wait for 7 days at every gate and 7 such gates.
						we need crash course but eth takes time.
						energy to get married vs energy to stay married.
					tvayaktamana - giving up all mana, even if he the son of great king.
						sandipani muni sent boys to forest - how serious this is - anything can happen.
						e1 in life should have experience of anything can happen.
						cuz that's how life is.
						little wrong then can't handle it cuz not trained so.
					pranipatanpara - able to offer dandavat cuz he is free from pride.
						st in temple boys get down and others claim what you doing - parents have not taught them at all.
						in classrooms we stand in front but gurukul times, prana sukhega if you won't get down.
						science of not seeking blessings - this does not give confidence.
						punjabi disciple offering dandavats to BSS in stingy place - what's the use of life if I can't bow unto you.
						don't call me by relationship but name - these days.
					prashnakala pratiksha - eager to learn from teacher, but waits knowing that by serving, all the question will be answered.
						question should be asked.
						BG and SB are knowledge but thru service.
					shantah shama
						quality for controlling external senses,
						cuz of this the previous can be achieved.
					dantah
						it is important to have inner and external character for developing daya.
					anusayah - should not be envious of guru, god brother's knowledge.
					shastra vishwasashali
						has the trust in shastra beyond material perceptional reality.
						nyaya is a tool not a goal - can't worship it - shraddha is therefore necessary.
					sharanamupagatah - disciple should search and take sheler of guru, by his search.
					praptaparikshah - it does not mean that guru has to accept, he should test, examine.
					kritavit - guru should take the student after studying of his quality of gratitude.
						kritajna vs rin - rin is fees paid and the dues are over.
				Qualities of Dhaumya rishi and Pandavas - both sides had these so best combo.
					name giving ceremony of parikshit.
					there with pandavas when Krishna leaving.
					marriage ceremony of Draupadi also - priest at that time also.
					He guided pandavas to see departure of bhishma dev - guiding them always.
					Miracle when student Arjuna and Dhaumya come together.
			Dhaumya tried to stop Jaydrath for hideous act - price for sinful activities.
				who guided pandavas to leave when Krishna left the planet.
					so foolish that Draupadi fell and no1 was around to pick her up.
						lady who is not in parampara of dhaumya but palace of illusion - Draupadi felt bad of having married Pandavas that's aparadh.
						imposing your character on Draupadi - even in her tough time she never thought anything other than dharma
					84 years saying that I am approach old age is good realization but 16 years thinking that I too will die is suicidal and he will become ghost.
					Heavens not just me but dog also - then common sense question.
					you didn't stop for pandavas but why dog - marana dharma - so could not stop but how can I stop taking care of dog.
					yaksha prashna was 1st question and this was second.
					Vyasa on ghatotkach and Abhimanyu death to Yudhisthir - don't lament for death but care for living.
					just like marriage - people talk after death but don't care for the living.
					Yudhisthir that's why thinking about dog - the living and not what's gone.
				Gotta leave when it's time
					MB is not a likeable thing - it's a deep shastra.
					Sukadev leaves and Parikshit also leaves after SB
						why left for takshak cuz raising consciousness is the whole point - body is anyways transient.
					don't worry that he would have got food or not - no, you should assume that he has cuz you can't help sitting here.
					go win is the consciousness of blessing giver.
			Pandavas would always travel while in forest and learn from sadhus.
				opportunity in adversity - got to learn from and about sadhus and also serve them.
				markandeya rishi taught them surrender.
				officially initiation for that also - although they were surrendered.

		<ArjunaSeries>
			Applications - Thriving in troubled waters, hunger for learning, Krishna sakha.
				ability to impress e1.
		Arjuna
			Lecture 1-3 : Thriving in troubled waters
			Lecture 4 : Hunger for learning.
			Lecture 5-6 : Krishna sakha
			<Lecture1>
				Application - ???
				Represents success, focus, prosperity, determination and stability.
					Ppl sympathize with Karna but e1 wants to be like Arjuna.
				Who is Arjuna
					Sanjay after BG samvad says I become ecstatic thinking about it - 2nd hand knowledge.
						Context for Arjuna but also generic message for e1. That's power of Krishna.
						Where there is Krishna and Arjuna - Krishna inspires Arjuna but not act for him.
							there is success, victory, etc.
							driver of chariot of life then all the power comes.
						BG does not cause fight but guides us.
					Arjuna is historical personality but also principle.
						SP - Arjuna and Kunti are eternal associate of Krishna.
						Arjuna expands in all brahmanda and plays the role of Arjuna.
						Arjuna has human and divine manifestation.
					Nara Narayan - dharma married murti the daughter of daksha -> nara and narayan appeared.
						In Badrinath - Arjuna and Krishna - avatar is descent - balance of human form and divinity.
						Krishna follows the rules of avatar.
					To invoke the nature, names should be given
						Brahmin's son - knowledge, stability and satisfaction.
						Kshatriya based on bala or strength.
						Arjuna - means shining, silver, brightness - assisting Krishna.
				?Some quick qualities overview
					Krishna wanted to identify himself with the greatness of Arjuna - so he said pandavanam dhananjay.
						what an appreciation by the very personality who made Arjuna was he was.
						Krishna himself ws ever fascinated by his friend and devotee.
						special fighting styles would stun Krishna.
						During marriage - Arjuna saw Krishna first time but recognized.
					Competence - savyasachi - can use both the hands.
						savyasachi institute
							fighting for young children - mardani khel - 1 police cop controls 38K citizens.
							Learn the art with proper sanskar - himsa is always directed towards helpless, this is always seen.
							kshatriya dharma is so important that when so trained in self defense you get strength.
							resourceful and sanskars => become self sufficient, no more looking for sympathy, don't complain, call ill names to society, don't play a victim card.
					Ability to fight and ability to discuss shastras.
						Meeting Gandharva Angara Parna.
					Can handle unpredictable situations
						Life is mostly arranged such that there are more unpredictable situations than predictable ones.
						the more we try to make things predictable, that much vulnerable we become unpredictable.
						Lost ability to handle unknown situations.
						Exhibition and Reality - capturing Drupada by Arjuna.
				Arjuna's defining characteristics.
					Thriving in troubled waters (Emphasis of this lecture)
					Hunger for learning (next lecture)
					...
				His life is not a stage performance but battlefield of chaos.
					For us it becomes yuddha symbolic - at home, school, office, within, etc.
					yuddha is specific and also principle.
					maam anusmara yuddhasca.
				Kauravas had stolen cows - cow fights have been very old.
				Stage performance is Uttama syndrome
					boastful b4 fight and when facing kauravas then you need Arjuna.
					Huge army is happiness for Arjuna - celebration.
					Arjuna - Going on battlefield fighting for dharma is my greatest pleasure
					just like calf looks for mother's milk and lovers looks for beloved.
				MB Injustice
					Many believe that good people should be satisfied internally so don't satisfy them externally.
					but Arjuna exemplifies that yes that's true but good people should not be externally satisfied
						cuz gotta contribute and also connected to external world.
				Can't be shaken from sva-dharma
					Powerful tapasvi with lots of shakti and ability to convince Arjuna to give up hunt for weapons and do tapasya.
					but Arjuna well aware of his svadharma so continued.
					I gotta be resourceful to stop those who have resources for wrong reason.
				Arjuna the student
					He became very famous for his intelligence, which entailed the ability to respond in difficult situations, focus of the mind, strength and enthusiasm.
					Arjuna having a good disposition of a student and for his great affection for his guru, he unconsciously or consciously became the best warrior.
					Although Drona was teaching e1 equally, he was irresistibly drawn to Arjuna and Arjuna was irresistably drawn to Drona.
				People like orderly environment but in chaos he was at his best.
					life is so designed that surprises come and they fall like cards.
					modern times create perfection like karna but stats no victory in real battle.
					BG - change of seasons - Change of events - suddenly camera, watches become redundant.
						change of business, change of royalty, change of overall philosphy, etc.
				Vasudev, father of Krishna - sent a pujari for all sanskars of Pandavas in forests.
					Imagine what they had to go thru in their teens.
				Rumors spent that they are not kuru-kul cuz not born of Pandu.
					that's not true cuz the way Dhritarashtra, Pandu, etc were born was also using Nirodha paddhati only.
					Bhishma didn't stop them - higher beings confirmed that they are officially sons of pandu.
					But for adopted people - It's a pain to know who their parents are.
					Even kunti speaks to Krishna - that I adopted by another was not easy for her.
				?Commands Respect - Always unconditionally respectful to teachers -
					Drona doesn't go to meet outta fear of masters
					Arjuna as brihannala was not change in dress but truly transgender.
					Letter being from mughal king was treated like mughal king
					Drona told about Brihannala that not ordinary guy.
					2 arrows - 1 at feet of Drona and 1 near the ears. Permission seeking and blessing.
				Arjuna hesitant to strike Bhishma
					Application - ???
					Learning is a journey and it concludes in when we apply what we learn.
					Applying and learning are 2 different things.
					From seeing Bhishma to killing him was a continual journey with so much "Dharma Sankat" to Arjuna.
					Arjuna's initial response - toughest decision we run away or walk out, procrastinate.
					Hanuman chalisa to not change the situation but to get courage to deal with situation.
					Krishna convinced not brainwashed him - inevitable and your dharma. And 10 days to convince himself.
					He would fight lesser on seeing Bhishma.
					9th day Bhishma killing left, right, center and Krishna picks weapon and Arjuna not at his best.
						his 9th day anger was result of Duryodhan's politics.
						Promise that I will fight properly but sunset so still thanked sun.
					Story of Panipat - 1 arrow changes the history - Hemu attacked on eye and whole army lost confidence.
					Vijaynagar king winning - 1 arrow with head tossed and subsequently 15 ton gold looted.
					Arjuna had a journey of decision to its execution - but stays determined
						what he is supposed to do is always in the mind even though he is frank about his limitations.
				We don't fight enemy but fight ideology
					so heroic death is given to enemy - it's only ideological differences.
					Shivaji after Afzal Khan's death gave cremation deserved by commander - which was misused when people started going there for mannat.
					?MB Dharma Yuddha - not faith war but ideological war. Eg - Bhurishrava.
						BR Chopra captures it well but what Arjuna must have gone thru to do that
							Bhurishrava and Satyaki - about to cut off head of Satyaki and killed Bhurishrava hand disruptive.
							How could you do this while other battles were going on.
							My dear Sir, I know vedas. When Kshatriya is fighting, he has to fight even relatives.
						MB was not dharma yuddha in its modern understanding, not a faith war - Krishna's devotees and non-devotees.
							None of dharma yuddha are related to faith.
						Krishna didn't protect many devotees on the kauravas side - Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Bhurishrava - but not protected cuz devotee cuz siding adharma.
							On other end, Ghatotkach who was adharmik and not necessarily Krishna's devotee but Krishna used his service.
							This is about Dharma but not shraddha. You make 7 into demon cuz believes sth that you don't believe in - that's personal business.
							bhakta and becoming dharmatma - bhakta not dharmatma was Bhishma so brought him down from adharma.
							angarakshak - both protect each other cuz he is his anga.
							Only king who considers praja has his part can rule properly.
						Arjuna - Abhimanyu was tortured and slaughtered by you only Bhurishrava.
							Bhurishrava could not say anything and sat there in meditation cuz otherwise great.
							Doing Vishnu puja and while not supposed to do but Satyaki ran to chop of his head while Arjuna screamed to not do it.
							Krishna recited same mantra that Ram sang for Jatayu. My dear Bhurishrava, go to the place that's beyond mala, Vaikuntha.
				Making impossible to possible
					Pleasing 2 authorities with contradictory orders.
					Killing of Ashwatthama encouraged by Krishna with Logic.
						Krishna - SB 1.7.37 - when one should not kill.
							equivocal words from Krishna for why to kill and why not.
						Why kill
							He is cruel, he exists at other's cost.
							Punish him, for his own well being or he will do down for his own action.
							Krishna - a friend or brahmin should not be killed but if he is an aggressor he must be killed.
								you have to fulfill your promise to your wife (and others) and you must also act to the satisfaction of Bhimasena and me.
								Arjuna in the middle.
						Why not kill
							Arjuna had promised Draupadi.
							as per Draupadi -
								he is brahmin so our SM.
								father exists in son.
								mother still living cuz she has a son.
								"Don't make the wife of Drona cry like me accordance with the principles of religion
									and were justified, glorious, full of mercy and equity, and without duplicity".
								all 5 sons killed - pain should not lead to revenge.
									previously, when dignity is questioned and challenged in vastra haran - justice has to be given.
									she was not revengeful but wanted justice.
						SP - contradictory orders of different persons are impossible to carry out.
							Therefore, a compromise was selected by Arjuna by his sharp intel and he separated the jewel from the head of Ashwatthama.
							Thus being insulted, the hummiliated Ashwatthama was simultaneously killed and not killed by the intelligence of Lord Krishna and Arjuna.
							Verbal punishment is like killing a brahmin.
				Drona's favorite - Foundational character of Arjuna
					Application - Submissiveness pleases Guru.
					How he responded when Drona in surprise, asked who will capture, Drupada? This was even b4 finishing their education.
					no1 asks for guru dakshina b4 teaching only tution classes
					Arjuna was quick to answer - this was Drona's seed of affection for life towards Arjuna.
				Drona continues to test them.
					Application - don't tell me, show me.
					Who among you will kill the bird.
						not MCQ but those who can hold guns.
						surprise test - no depression allowed so we pamper children.
						mardani khel - no prana present - people collapse in morning assembly - can't even stand in morning assembly.
						b4 shooting, asked what do you see - I see everything.
						Yudhisthir asks your lotus feet - this is not vyas puja.
						Only eye of the bird - he didn't think what answer is best - no smartness but alertness.
						IAS QA - 1 devotee told about tikdam questions
							can you drop an egg without breaking it - here it can refer to concrete so smart.
								Or boil the egg is another alternative.
							can you jump from this window - 3rd floor
								he jumped inside the building.
						His answer was not smart but his reality.
						Ashwatthama - why do you favor him so much.
							even karna got to learn under him - BR Chopra doesn't show it that way.
					Crocodile test - abrupt.
						mystical person - competent with mantra and yantra to save himself but screamed help.
						Narsimha arti, trayambakam yajamahe chanting is all good but practically - nobody could help.
						Arjuna shot an arrow - hit crocodile to open the mouth of croco without hurting guru.
						Drona demonstrated to others what makes Arjuna special and being pleased gave him brahmastra.
					Observed some partiality with son of Drona
						vessel same size but greater mouth opening of Ashwatthama's vessel.
						Arjuna just made that observation but didn't complain to his father being the king
							not threatening the teacher
						Next time - Arjuna didn't go there and varunastra to fetch water.
						Indicating to Drona that Arjuna is extremely smart, alert, and eager to learn.
						so taught him.
					Gudakesh - Drona heard the sound of bow arrows.
						observed Arjuna practicing in the night.
						once light went off in the daytime and he managed to eat in darkness - so should I be able to shoot in dark.
					Such students fascinate the teachers.
						unlike these days when both teachers and students wait for the session to end.
				Fascinating his opponents
					Application - real hero impresses his opponents.
					Capturing Drupad - and impressing him in the process - that's Arjuna.
						Drupad definitely angry with Drona.
						So fascinated that He decided that get his daughter married.
					Even Karna glorified Arjuna
						b4 fighting he said imagine my fortune of fighting against him - what will my stature be if I defeat him.
						Modern authors have made him more famous than he deserves.
				Exhibition and Reality - Ekalavya's exhibition and trial
					Application - Good for exhibition but bad for reality then talent isn't glorious.
					making it up vs limitless practice.
					Sadhana vs practice - respond in challenging situation.
						Practice is in conscious event where you know what to expect.
						Eg
							music concerts practice b4 perform.
							But shastriya sangeet is sadhana - you must practice raagas.
								Foundational principle of music is understood then no matter what song you give him he sings with expertise.
							Ayurvedic doctor also same thing.
						efficiency and precisely is lost with practice games.
					Vyasa tells story as it is - Arjuna is not minimized.
						Drona declared that he would make Arjuna best archer
							Ekalavya from nowhere comes and shoots the barking dog shocking Arjuna.
						yes the talent was exquisite which threatened Arjuna being young.
							right wing or left wing - there is no critical thinking but a sold out veredicts.
							Vyasa is not like that - when his favorite characters show weakness he writes it.
							without critical thinking there is no growth - only flattery and blind following.
						Arjuna asks Drona that he is better than me - that's human.
							Kunti gives only twins to madri and nothing more.
							Kaushalya chastises Dashrath for exiling Ram but didn't become demonic over it.
							When Arjuna lost Abhimanyu he lamented - that's humanness but he rose.
							to say that Arjuna never saw any human weakness or that he was a villain there - both are wrong.
						Drona tells Ekalavya to remove his thumb
							1 movie super 30 tells that samaj ne ekalavya ke hamesha ungli katvaya hai.
								not true.
								IIM prof's book - economics in India were prosperous. All shudras were free and didn't work for anybody.
									they were all independent entrepreneurs.
								vs Guha was Nishadraj - kingdom outside of VA.
									Both were nishads but Ram didn't take his thumb but called him his brother.
							Actual reason is revealed in MB itself in 2 verses.
								This guy will not use the knowledge for the right purpose - just like in this demonstration.
								jnana should be given but for what purpose.
							Ekalavya system
								60% sizzerian in India but 14% in world - being threatened while so much success rates.
									this place is known for natural delivery - fit and strong - ghee and haldi
									ekalavya becomes system - threaten the patient, manage patient, don't cure him.
								1 USA doctor who could not get herself cured with allopathy - grandmother being ayurvedic specialist guided.
									he later wrote integral medicine book.
									his boss told her - we want to manage our patients - they should stay with us as customers and not leave.
								SP - modern education system is being forced to work under others.
									independent ability to work is gone.
									Gujaratis after education say that I don't wanna do business anymore.
								Ekalavya represents a system - threatening.
								Ekalavya was threatening - an alternative government.
									how much damage he could do so Drona showed smartness.
									Give me your thumb - he gave but still so powerful.
									Krishna sides Dharma
									Ghatotkach was killed; Krishna celebrated his death.
									Arjuna questioned why so - how much I have to organize everything.
									I had kept shishupal, Jarasandh, Ekalavya and Karna all separate.
									If they would have come together, it would have become difficult for you.
									I killed Ekalavya outside of battlefield - it is satya, forbearance, etc.
									Although he was family but conscious organized opposer of dharma, vedas, protection of cows.
									I lost him and also karna death is now possible.
									If Ghatotkach would not have died today, I would have killed him.
									Krishna is so transparent - not just family but dharmic so I am connected to them.
							Arjuna is a system of warrior - you come to me - I will give you freedom to live in your own way.
								Chanakya - admin should not become more powerful than people.
								Raja should not be more powerful than rajya.
									cuz purpose of governance is to give freedom to people.
									Eg - Britishers - banned sword fightings and martial arts in Kerela, etc.
										banned sari, bharatnatyam, etc.
										stopped fine arts, buying cotton, etc.
										why India so divided - so many kings and systems
										cuz more diverse it is, the more self sufficient you remain.
										Not divided but diverse.
									Eg - 1 dev who is prof in IIM had to go to South America for 5 days.
										Lima, Peru - economics in PhD - pics from there - you see 2 things - Jesus and poverty.
										Posters and pasteurs everywhere - it was prospering country b4 being colonized.
										flourishing country b4 but they lost their language, prosperity, all lost.
										Some say that Christianity in India sanitized our system - not true - see South America.
										Not fanatic; critical thinking from prof of IIM.
										unsafe but filled with faith.
							Arjuna goal is prosperity and not control people - that's why Krishna wanted him to be ruler.
								Even Yudhisthir would be chakravarti but won't control like dictator but prosper e1.
								why India has to fear Pakistan - so much in army they have invested - unlike other countries.
									apna niyantran na jaye.
								Talking to 1 air force officer - you know what ethos of our understanding
									we exist to not let outsider force to threaten our independence.
									Praja can speak anything - so we don't interfere in public domain.
									disaster management is exception but we don't interfere only outsiders.
									That's not our style to tell our own citizens that you move and I remove your head.
								Yudhisthir had liberty and freedom to tell you grow as much as you like.
									relish your freedom.
								Arjuna represents that mentality of not letting that freedom to be taken away.
									so removal of thumb of ekalavya is very important principle in MB.
			</Lecture1>
			<Lecture2>
				Exhibition match - Karna performed better than Arjuna.
					Application - Life is more than an exhibition match
					Karna would never perform in need - in desperate need, Arjuna would perform.
					Life is not about event but connection of events and collectively.
					Against Drupad Karna was defeated.
					Bhima and Arjuna - not just obliged to teacher - good intentions not enough - need good strategy.
					4 things reqd for success besides daiva says Vidura
						raaga (connection to mentors), yoga (resources), dakshata (expertise), tantra (strategy)
					Bhima has rudra shakti - vayu after all.
					capture with dignity - Drupad was captured.
				Arjuna learning archery - I me mine was there but connected to greater cause
					Application - KC is expansion of I me and Mine and not its negation.
					I Me Mine exists in Spiritual world also
					Can't free oneself from desire - to become shunya is also a desire.
					Ramayan - Janak gave Sita to Ram.
						He also talking in terms of I, me, mine - this I me mine is very small
						but my sita or my Krishna is very expansive.
					There is svarth in material and spiritual life.
						I need to progress in spiritual life.
						connection to world become lesser gradually if cultivated properly.
					If material world is so useless why would Krishna come and stay for so long.
						Kings don't have love affair but political affair.
						Pandavas - lakshagriha.
				Ganga flowing - angara parna stops Arjuna from bath.
					Application - always willing to fight for dharma or right cause
					Arjuna tells him about Ganga having no discrimination.
					Gandharva about to be defeated by mortal so fought and Arjuna defeated.
					Knew shaastra and shastra.
						Martial arts are physical but kalipedu or mardani khel - experience divinity in shastra also.
						Drona Didn't give brahmastra - to son (you can't do tapasya) and Karna can't control senses so can't.
					Gave chariot but Arjuna won't take favors - so gave teaching and got chariot.
				Draupadi marriage so 5:1 can have confusions so discipline.
					Application - special situation, special measures.
					Narad proposed discipline of 1 year association.
					Others must stay away from her every 1 year and if they do then go to forest for 1 year.
					Love marriage can be as much chaotic as arranged marriage and without discipline, it can be more.
				Arjuna had to enter private chambers to get Gandiva.
					Application - dharma sankat then sacrifice dharmetar.
						sudden decisions need lots of training previously.
					Brahmin yajna means cows should be available.
						Cow very important
						1 Brahmin's cow was taken away.
						Kaushalya in Ramayan - Did he separate calf from cow in last life that I had to go thru it.
					more than admin, protection is greater duty of kshatriya.
						Arjuna was not upset that's why he would move away as some propose
						Arjuna in fact proposed how he could marry b4 elders.
						Draupadi had more affection for Arjuna but that's natural not adharma.
						Here what's the more important principle he thought.
							Bhima killing for sairendhri was this dharma sankat and choosing higher dharma of protection compromising even in cognito if he must.
					5 things - cows, Brahmins, women, children, old people.
						Culture endorsing, protecting, supporting and encouraging these aspects of civilization they prosper.
						Protect Brahmin => Protect knowledge.
							BCCI have 20K crores and don't have to pay income tax.
							Coach get 7 crore Rs per year for training them.
							Ved Pandit - shabd power.
							Communist govt have no faith in extending the culture of God.
							Donation to qualified person is daan, unqualified person is daya.
							food to poor people is daya; to qualified brahmin it's daan.
							Dev once asked what if millionaire, then best is to bring education - protect knowledge.
						Protect cow => spiritual protection.
						Protect children => their future.
						Protect oldies => their ultimate destination.
							crores of them. SB audience? that's what they should do - no better daan than this.
						Protect women => making them consciously cry than lakshmi or prosperity is gone.
							Ram asks bharat - All women happy and protected right, confidential matters not told to them right.
							good and bad in e1
							Chanakya - when 7 marries woman from other country - it is disaster - never marry from outside cuz affects legacy of country.
						We in fruitive mindset catch only youth while they are important but other 5 are also worth protecting.
					decision to be taken based on
						no instant guidance cuz life not based like that.
						it has to come from your intel, paramatma, etc.
						we gotta take decisions ourselves.
					Yudhisthir says no need to go for 12 years.
						In MB, people would quote scriptures and not people cuz who is ultimate authority.
						If guru contradicting sadhu and shastra then reconcile and so with shastra and so on.
						Elder brother is like parents so your entering is not that serious. If I enter that's problem.
					Krishna wanted Arjuna to travel for gathering resources as Dhananjaya - resources thru marriage alliances - married chitrangada, Ulupi and Subhadra.
						Draupadi glorifies but feels upset.
				Why Arjuna goes to different demigods
					Application - multi-tiered life should be dealt with at respective tiers.
						demigods are a reality and not to be negated or obsessed.
					Problems at different tiers should be solved at that tiers respectively.
					Healing course - 9K Rs - money has to go to some Brahmins.
						problems cause by human or human efforts, should be solved at that level.
						problems caused by daiva, need to solved at daiva level.
						problems of body solved by gross medicines. That of mind by mental means.
						Foundation problem by misidentification of by then yoga.
						Medicines not given by Krishna so not loyal. Some medicines not even veg also.
						Not made by devs - some don't believe in God. ISRO with tilak.
					1 Baniya Dev in NY - Indian raised in USA - hardcore westernized desi or confused desi.
						Hardcore westernized desi
							knew nth about puja path, eating lifestyles, etc.
							Kerela people also eat - 1 brahmachari from kerala admitted having consumed bad.
							description of food provided by king in Kerela b4 britishers.
							pure vegetarian - bloodless revolution book mentions.
							USA devotee - cultural context is not there. all life sanskars in India but not there.
							True vaishya works very hard - no lenience in that regard.
							In effort nth less, but nth coming out.
						NY dev goes to astrologer - you know philosophy transcend this.
							But not able to transcend. It's a real problem you are working hard for.
							If I approach devatas won't it be compromise - you have come to NY it's already a compromise - that's not a place for best PDS.
							It's a capital of Kaliyuga. Raghunath DG didn't go to NY to practice DS.
							I am not compromising right - if you stop chanting that's compromise.
							But if you chant another mantra, that may act as a subtle level medicine.
							st people get attached to medicine - medicine is not our goal but the means.
							Doctor is not our SM unless by profession b4.
							SM does not tell solution to ulcers that's a bodily problem.
							Medicine does not heal, it increases body's already existing healing power.
							Medicine creates a facility to the body.
					Another devotee he tried all pathy's - allopathy, homeopathy, tirupathy also.
						finally vastu and astrology solved his problem.
						It is mathematical - not mystical and it's dependable.
					?I don't accept it as nastik or transcendentalist - both are extreme stands.
						it's a vidya. 1 not believing in vedas is nastik.
						Arjuna respected all demigods. Loving Krishna is not same as using Krishna.
						Krishna se prem karo. Krishna se philosophy sikho.
						rog and yog has a gap of daiva also which is highly ignored these days.
						Arjuna spoke to whoever demigod he had to talk to but all for Krishna.
							Krishna says I am Dhananjaya among pandavas so Krishna approves that.
							you are able to handle this knowledge cuz you are my friend and devotee.
						won't approach demigods and then go to mosque or church. Some learn black magic from sw.
							and then would even sacrifice chicken cuz of aspirations.
						sharirik problems - aushadhi. daiva problems - subtle sciences like mantra. yoga - identity problem.
							MB explains - continuous along with these.
				Ulupi Vivah - sadhana even in shock
					Sadhana in Shock - agni vandan. haridwar dragged into water and sees water palace.
					agnihotra continued even in problem, made agni dev happy.
					Meets ulupi - but I can't cuz celibate - that's with Draupadi alone.
					Arjuna accepts her.
					practice for skill. asana is practice but also sadhana for a bigger yoga goal.
					practice is for outside and sadhana (or sadhan or means) is for inside.
				khandavprastha - For new development, the previous has to be sacrificed.
					srishti mein samhar - this is integral principle of life.
						so much violence - agni consumed it all.
						the great non-violence attempt of 1947 led to greatest violence in the history of world.
						Punjab divided but sindhis completely dislodged from their roots
						call yourself gujarati but never get to go there.
						from sindh pakistan to India so many committed suicide. is it not violence.
						ahimsa can't be established without himsa - world laws are not made like that.
					Advani has to retire if party has to survive.
					Bali chadhana is not murdering. You are reluctant to do but no growth without it.
					1 dev in ashtang hridayam
						In ayurveda treatment, even best of brahmin doctor will recommend meat product also.
						ayurved is not about vegetarianism or not - but medicine which works.
						then is human life that important that violence to other jivas is justified - that's a reality that human life is superior to other life.
						human life has a superior reason to live. If living for sake of it, then karma.
						If living for higher cause and in the bargain if you do sth - you will have power to digest your karma.
						meant to control circumstantial situation so you gotta recommend.
					on 1 hand the world aborts babies in millions and on other hand, so much pampering that buises, mudstud not allowed.
						it's white bread so soft - no strength.
						doctor not willing to take risk - without risk how can we further the society.
					Need strength and also resources - India has lots of strength and intel but not resources.
						2 mani bhavan - palace of pearl and your life strength increases.
				yukta vihar as per BG.
					Indra distracting Arjuna from svadharma.
						brilliant tapasvi at root of tree performing tapa.
						throw this dhanush and try to achieve perfection.
						could not create conflict in Arjuna's mind.
						Indra asked to ask for any benediction.
						chariot wonderful, gandiva bow used by agni - like sachin's bat - mahaprasad.
						tapasya is better than shastra and shaastra - his goal was not to study scriptures but dispel in fear of people.
					confusion but only for some time - not like us who either don't have sp identity, or in crisis.
						only once Arjuna in precarious situation instead of thriving, became confused - willing to throw away his weapons
				savyasachin Arjuna -
					These days phenomenon is specialize as sales MBA, etc.
					specialization st destroys your general knowledge; wholesomeness is destroyed and you become isolated.
					woman becomes an MBA and does not know cooking rice anymore st.
						is cooking responsibility of women - no major cooking is always done by men - festivals, temple, hotel, etc.
						women also have quality to cook - doesn't mean not good in other fields.
						women specialized schools - baseball, basketball, cricket, etc.
						with training women can do whatever men can do but still look for a superior husband why's that.
						you don't want man as a husband who earns lesser than you.
							Singapur you must join army for 2 years and distracted while women get to pursue education.
							Problem that many women don't get qualified husband.
							If girl marries inferior guy, it's not easy to handle.
						Manu samhita tells marries as per parent's choice but that's not the only statement that manu samhita makes.
							in name of giving freedom to women we make them helpless.
							in name of freedom, we don't compromise empowerment.
							What's difference between freedom and empowerment.
							Politician said vice-prez of BJP - I don't believe in Kanya daan.
							colossal adharma takes place when Draupadi is disrobed and nothing is done about it.
							empowerment comes by samarthya not sympathy - only 1 with samarthya and resources commands respect.
								so what it really needs is prayas.
								why not treat men and women equal - he said you are making assumption.
								why would a company recruit someone based on social rules accepted by people.
								they would like to hire based on people's calibre and capacity.
								If I can hire a man at 100K dollars, why hire a person for 140K only because she is a woman.
								it should not be joked I agree.
								But women friendly laws, you see weak women don't get to use it, only reckless ones get to misappropriate them.
								Law is not meant to be used but law is meant for justice.
								law is meant for justice to 5 weaklings - misused doesn't mean we should not talk about it.
								Balance is required - traditional people are extremely rigid and liberal are extremely unscientific.
								dharma means to create a balance.
								I don't believe and will never believe that empowerment means giving freedom at expense of making society reckless.
								Whole MB fought for Draupadi.
								I disagree that no society has respected women like Indian society..
								Draupadi is not responsible for bloody war but war was fought to give justice to her.
								We are not making her responsible but giving her justice - it is based on shastra.
								Pandavas said compromise. Krishna said for this injustice I will not compromise.
								What's projected is USA respects women and India is rape capital - how can I accept that.
								Current times any english speaking is called educated - they are the ones dominating the narratives.
								So from 1 extreme to another extreme has to be debated and it will hurt some people.
								But that hurting is not the purpose.
								See Kunti - she was not an innocent devotee but knew shastra and politics so much.
								See Draupadi, Sita - all literatures about Sita portray her as abused person.
								Same goes with Shakuntala also - it's all false - they were not helpless women.
								All present days social problems are directly connected to scriptures presenting a view of oppressed society.
								So that battle also we gotta fight - shastra made women like so - not true.
								Another battle is truly empower them which is purpose of vedas.
								This narrative is everywhere.
								I disagree I will always speak like this - woman needs man as their hero else it's broken marriage. I can quote statistics.
								Man has to be woman's hero.
								"I apologize" - you don't have to - you are hurt - we discussed that.
								You are hurt we are sorry for that
								she had a relevant need to discuss - that's respected - nth wrong in that.
								We still have time for QA.
					Arjuna equally balanced - Music and Muscle
						Arjuna had to stay away from his gandiva for long time.
						his greatness that could use gandiva and at same time could teach vina, the string instrument.
						Arjuna said to king - I can braid hair; make earrings, flower garlands. Can give baths, clean mirrors, make rangolis, teach music.
						Present education system makes you flat in growth not wholesome growth - I wanna do this and not do that.
						Man comes back and I have come from work and don't want to help with kitchen - she also has come from work.
						Arjuna is best of purush - mahabaho, best of bharats, bulls among men.
						Unfortunately when one become intellectual, 1 loses sensitivity - that's a sign of arrogance.
							and when you are sensitive, you lose the power of discretion.
							Arjuna is a concept also not just person.
							Men can be sensitive like Arjuna and women can be strong like Arjuna.
							Arjuna is a balance of masculine and feminine energy.
							pure feminine energy becomes the object of exploitation.
							only masculine energy causes cruelty and not sensitive.
							Arjuna showcases masculine energy most of the times.
							Only fittest will prevail - this is unfortunate reality - jivo jivasya jivanam.
							You can't grow in life looking for sympathy or getting charity.
							But only by empowering yourself and harmonizing your energy.
							act of cooking is also feminine energy - there is refineness - a little more does not feel good.
							Life is about balance.
				Arjuna and Urvashi
					You witch trying to spoil my career - neither too bad nor excited.
					Why Arjuna attracted to her dance - as respect while they performing their arts.
						and why specific cuz of her exquisite art and Arjuna's knowledge of natya kala not lust.
						that's why Urvashi approaches but Arjuna denies calling her mother
						yes but it does not apply in heavens; And considered Arjuna as heavenly being.
						No my vision does not change wherever I go.
						so curse of becoming Eunuch.
					Arjuna shocked at what happened - I didn't come here for this.
						Indra clarifies that it would help. Opportunity in adversity.
						Arjuna also applauded by Indra that it's a feat impossible for others.
						Vyas tells whoever hears this story remains stable and reasonable in choices of life.
					Urvashi was born from the lap of nar narayan. Not tempted and not even angry to curse - unlike Vishwamitra muni.
					Body of eunuch but Virat admitted you must be from royal family.
						Prana in him. And same nature - that's not gone.
					Arjuna is balance of being powerful and soft.
					Arjuna so sensitive - heavens does not give daya bhav or compassion emotion.
						extreme pleasure or extreme pain then thinking about others is not possible.
				B4 leaving Arjuna asked Dhaumya
					please protect my brothers and allow them to travel all across planet.
					Dhaumya had taken other pandavas feeling separation from Arjuna in all 4 directions.
			</Lecture2>
			<Lecture3>
				Virat had many mistake like not protecting sairendhri from Keechak.
					Despondent of losing servants. Fear, respect, confusion.
					Marriage for uttara - power thru marriage alliance.
					Allowed in those days. Arjuna elder and Uttara was young. Dasharath was 60 and Kaikeyi was 18.
					Even women st want this.
					Arjuna rejected that he had been teacher but respected proposal by accepting her for Abhimanyu.
					Later Uttara's child will be Parikshit and seed for SB.
					Yayati with youth taken away by Shukracarya - shamelessly asked his child and puru accepted.
					Shantanu didn't take away from Bhishma but as father he didn't deny that but accepted.
					Chitraketu - object of negligence - women from good families became murderous.
						circumstantially murderous - they are not serial killer.
						cruelty is not necessarily a conditioning of a person but can be caused by surroundings also
						can't be called rakshasi (only mind problem and temp intel)
					Limitation is natural character of jiva - he could marry uttara but had her for abhimanyu.
					60 years of parikshit was much superior to Yudhishthir's rule.
				QA not for knowledge but for transformation.
					Arjuna getting confused - 1 person writes - but getting confused is an aspect of life which can't be denied.
				Krishna gave 1st choice to Arjuna to ask - I want you not your army.
					Do you want Indra's horse, Or Krishna riding from behind - I want you not Indra.
						Neutral unbiased me or favors of army with each as good as I.
						Jiva tatastha is different. Krishna being tatastha is non favoritism but Krishna always favors dharma.
						In abrahamic religion God doesn't come to world but as per vedas he does.
					In politics more than blessings you need votes. Similarly, what makes you win is number power and resources but choosing Krishna ain't easy.
						politics depends on the principle of what now and only present.
						st father creates conflict among children for control.
						King is respected for position but not dependent - SCA jivas are powerful in themselves.
						Satrajit had independence to not give jewel to king.
					SP - people come to God not for what God is but what God has - asking God himself is highest thing to ask.
						Poor man made friendship with king. Only bregadier in colony then people fear to befriend.
						I am king and didn't reveal cuz you may start asking favors - when I have you, what would I ask.
						as much as self sufficient, that much your friendship becomes real else burden only.
						Arjuna was friend of Krishna.
					Krishna had the reign of Arjuna's life.
					1 saint of Ramanuja sampradaya would stand by feet - why not head - that's Duryodhan's side.
					Krishna's narayani sena to fight Krishna.
						Using Krishna given resources to defy his existence or fight his ideology or him.
						Tripathi nastik - arrogance along with atheism in India.
						Beef eating in hinduism - 1 vaishnava born guy who was converted by britishers wrote the book.
					Ram so powerful - Huge Ravan army and Vanars rushed away.
						Ram thru special weapon appeared midst every 2 soldiers and they killed each other.
						This story comes in MB - Markandeya telling to Pandavas.
					Arjuna tells Yudhisthir - Krishna is synonymous to victory, humility.
						where there's Krishna there is victory and there is dharma.
						Therefore why choose anything other than Krishna.
						Dhritarashtra's BG 1st question sounds so stupid
							sitting in prasadam hall what did they do - I will eat.
							While it's externally true but there's more to it - not that simple.
							when politicians make a statement it has layers to it - 100s of them
							Why? cuz if later quotes him he can present another perspective to what he had said.
							Politicians never ask or answer questions simply or just like that.
							it is actually a psychology or mindset while speaking it.
							Karna and shalya discuss this
								Karna - In arya vrata has 4 categories - Kaushalas, magadha, kuru panchalas, dravidaas.
								their sharpness and expertise is different.
								magadh - they can listen to eye brows movement or eyes - so best as spies.
								kaushals - good as reading face.
								kuru panchal - half word understood fully.
								dravidas - they understand the full words.
							after BG, 1st question of Dhritarashtra is answered.
								wherever there is Krishna and Arjuna there is success, victory, etc.
								hinduism unlike other faiths - BG and SB difference not known forget learning it.
								MB has a lots - life sciences and 100 types of lies thru story and much more.
					In wartime you don't collect resource - wartime is for blessings.
						If not done, then god's grace should not even be expected.
						Krishna won't stop train or airplane cuz you are late.
						So 2 fingers shorts idea is strongly understood here - Arjuna's endeavor and Krishna's grace.
						Vedanta - action, place of action, involvement, living entity (instrument also) - 80% is jiva responsibility.
						ISRO did eth and then went to tirupati - if they had gone there without work then their credibility and faith both would be questioned.
						King's ideosyncracies - 2 good lemons and got 2 villages.
							see magic of my lemon - Yes but it came cuz of king's mercy - but that won't come without lemon
							This is vedant philosophy.
						faithful without knowledge - emotional and sentimental - plane late or surgery so now Krishna's responsibility.
							if accident, then why god did this - is this even a right question?
							your ways were not correct - 1 of drivers could be drunk or didn't have attention, etc.
							if seed of jamun then don't expect mango. Of course, rains is also necessary so daiva is necessary.
						Krishna can be tied by yashoda but not by duryodhan so just attempt ain't enough.
							Krishna has no start or end so how can you bind him.
							sarva dharman parityajya - has its seed in maam anusmara yudhyasca.
				Arjuna's lowest point in life was BG chapter 1.
					never bewildered but bewildered to teach lesson to us.
					being in precarious situation is natural aspect of life
						observing army as SP puts it is precursor of lamentation that ensues.
						Dhoni run out and people get heart attack.
						RNSM met Sachin - Maharaj do you follow cricket - RNSM being gracious.
							I am American and also sadhu so don't know much about cricket but there are many fans of yours in my temple.
							He became happy.
							New zealand kya cheez hai - people asked me - I don't make them play.
					Even taking to spirituality doesn't forgo dualities of the world - dvandva rahega hi.
						success impact has its equivalent of pain of being denied.
						death is not predictable in kali yuga at all - it's like chinese products.
						?we are not aligned to nature much so risky
						Arjuna who knew vedas and had fought many battles.
							but quivering hands.
					Arjuna equipped with best - quiver, chariot, horses, flag of hanuman, etc.
						hanuman used to make sound from flag.
						But despondency is still possible.
							3 of them in BG 1 - Dhritarashtra (maybe pandavas will go back), Duryodhan and Arjuna.
							?that way SP's title is most apt - observing the army cuz it's not just Arjuna's lamentation.
						Bhishma said I will kill 10K people but not pandavas.
							imagine Kohli saying I won't hit in that match.
							as long as bhishma lives I won't fight said Karna.
							Krishna came to karna camp then fight for pandavas - that's politics.
							waiting for commander in chief to die - this neutral people are very dangerous.
					Arjuna represents success - savyasachi, vijay, falgun, krishna, yuyutsu, kiridi, dhananjay.
						we gotta accept body as long as I stay despondent and suffer.
						we have to keep accepting body as long as we are unhappy - forget karma, reaction, sins, etc.
						artificially situated in distress - distress continues cuz we choose it.
					BG practical philosophy
						Is indriya sukh or SG sinful - banned for jiva?
							in bodily concept of life we can't enjoy spiritually so natural to stay in touch with it.
							Yudhishthir despondent cuz not able to serve.
							go beyond going and coming of object of senses - pleasure but limitless misery so avoid.
							Shaunak rishi - sukh is also 1 seed of overcoming distress.
							BG - yukta ahar viharasya.
							paap punya ka quota hai you continue the jiva.
							quota of happiness you enjoy and sufferings you manage skillfully.
							Some gopis were not allowed - their whole happiness was concentrated on meeting Krishna
								and when denied, intense concentrated suffering also ended and their bodies as well.
							can't achieve Krishna prema - only hanuman could cross for Lanka but others had to use bridge.
						Krishna's purpose of philosophy is to establish tattva alone - advaita or dvaita but to get action.
							Krishna says so many times - yudhyasva vigatajvara.
							Chocolate eaters can't eat sugarcane so BG is the sugarcane juice but digesting it is also difficult.
							BG is action with detachment - kriya with asakti yields duality and other side discourages inaction so detachment is a very important aspect of karma.
							inaction doesn't make us men of wisdom - not withdrawl from college, etc.
							We have stopped the experience of failing.
							1 coach once told his apprentice - experience this - relish the failure
							duality is so important - then you will not be angry with God.
						Krishna's message is dualities so tams-titikshasva bharata and not a victory promise
							Krishna never promised victory to Arjuna in entire BG - we promise but Krishna doesn't.
							See Krishna's tone if you win then worldly rule. Heavens if you die.
							Ch1 and 2 should convince you that despondency will always be part of life for e1 but it's a treasure of our philosophy.
							samasya come but saamna has to be understood.
							BG essence is act in divine consciousness.
							Yudhishthir - I act cuz I need to act. I don't have choice other than to act. Sukh and freedom is constitutional nature.
							Bal Gangadhar Tilak - Freedom is my birthright and I will achieve it by any means.
								where did he get this - it's not a political statement but a philosophical statement.
								philosophical statement for political emancipation - jiva is SCA
								we have no choice but to be happy and choosing happiness on Arjuna's path is yoga.
					how is Arjuna vishad yoga - how it became yoga - it's not rog.
						mental problems were considered taboo in world and tortured.
						vedas never seen mental problems as sin - it's disease.
						Body is not sin - it's instrument for perfection of life.
						It's a prison and a fort - go inside or outside when necessary.
						originally we are KC entities and no original sin.
						sin is always circumstantial. Sin is a spark in the sky.
						purity and eternality is reality of soul.
					Krishna didn't curse Arjuna - gadha kahin ka. so much time I gave to you in past.
						Becoming disturbed at the worst time.
						Krishna gave a curse of 3K years to Ashvatthama - it's nothing in comparison to eternality.
						Madhvacharya says Ashvatthama will become Vyas dev in next life.
						Vedas are super positive. By BG 2.14 Gita is over but detailed further.
						Bhagavan ke mukh se shap nahi ashvasan nikalta hai.
					Devotees in difficulty st say that I don't want to listen Philosophy but that's the most critical need time to hear philosophy.
					Arjuna - yoga raag dakshata tanta - all exist in him.
						courage gathered. Approached Krishna mentor so raag.
						daksha knew whom to approach. tantra - had sense of what to do.
						BG has eth - management, mal shastra.
						In 40 minutes (SP says), Arjuna was ready back on track of duty.
					had intel enlightenment but lots of efforts to have it at karma level.
						Dhritarashtra told Duryodhana and Vidura - If they acted as nara narayan then they can destroy us in blink of eye but on human level they will take some days.
							Cricket 9th wicket gone but hope still retained - good quality but misplaced.
						Life is not about taking decision to kill Duryodhan but to take tough decisions like dealing with Bhishma.
							That's the purpose of BG.
							BG spoken to increase anger towards Duryodhana and Karna.
							More so, BG spoken to reconcile Arjuna's affection to Bhishma and devotion to dharma.
							Don't reduce affection. Doing needful.
							Such dielemma we escape those situations.
					Outburst was there - it's natural
						expressing anger not sin.
							those who don't express emotions they die from inside.
							MB and Ramayan - father of shravan - If I don't express, then ulcers in belly will happen.
						Arjuna shooting Bhishma is shooting and crying.
							Bhishma wanted arrows from Arjuna to kill him not Shikhandi's.
							Bhishma had always done things for others, never for himself - he should have done.
							Not doing only for yourself also ain't best.
							svadharma and lok sangrah is MB principle - self and others.
							Bhishma wanted support for neck - not pillows - he knows how to answer questions so gave arrows.
						Narayani sena was destroyed by producing an illusion of Krishna and Arjuna being all over.
						Dhrishtadyumna urged not to be killed like that strangled but to die like kshatriya fighting
							he said you don't deserve this.
							That's the spirit of kshatriya willing to die in battle.
						Narad Muni appreciates Dhruva's determination not chastising it - praises it to Uttanapad.
						Ganga mata his mother came quenching not just thirst but a lifetime of struggle.
							Arjuna also conflicts in life but constant success whereas Bhishma conflicts in life but every selfless act was counter productive.
							But never left his faith that's Bhishma.
				Arjuna had to defeat Jayadrath - may fire consume me and far more list of all sins to me.
					sharanagat then no problem.
					Drona tries to stop Krishna's chariot from running away - Arjuna circumambulates and moves on.
					Duryodhan comes with golden armor - Arjuna could pierce that will special arrows - hands and palms.
					Great battle he expected but can't fight with such.
					Drona once in ashram said - if you ever fight with me, Arjuna, fight fully.
					Arjuna had done in Virat but here Krishna suggested to move on.
					Always responding very alertly in every situation.
				can't avoid duality but Arjuna showed how to reconcile and harmonized duality ?or harnessed it.
					Arjuna once said - in life nth good or bad - there's seed of bad in every good and potential of good in every bad.
					By contemplating on the great devotees and Krishna - we start to imitate them naturally.
					thought process and ideology we start to live and that way become mini-Arjuna.
					here or spiritual world serving Krishna - Arjuna also a gopi it's said.
			</Lecture3>
			<Lecture4>
			Quality 2 - Hunger for Integral Learning
				Learning so important
					Sudama and Krishna sent to get firewood
					Ash has variety, water is different (?structure), woods are different - firewood, etc.
					different woods for different yajna, even different kinds of fire.
					Vedas are beneficial when information becomes wisdom.
					Vidya should be to apply. Like fire extinguishers - lie but never used.
				Krishna tells Daruka - Arjuna is my very soul.
					You are my friend and devotee.
				His passion of learning
					Arjuna - I want to see you even in representation - God is matter.
					BG - We live in material world so ability to see him in matter is the real challenge.
						Krishna pleased with this questions, lovingly addresses him and continues to tell.
						The greatness of lion, best cheater, etc.
						See his energy ew.
						in MB vocab you won't find "do for Krishna" - eth is for him only.
						BG is kriya and parinam - Krishna doesn't want us to behave in a certain way.
						How long can you stay away - you choose not cuz 7 monitors you.
				?Vidya means vinay - You get sth but also lose - so sober.
					370 abrogation - This is not correct - marry Kashmiri girl.
					1 army officier said you can't win them by force but they need confidence.
					even 5 villages will offer you protection - even Indra won't look in your direction.
					Don't take our affection for granted but our army is also ready.
					Perfection is not to understand Krishna or his relationships
						completely - no matter how much you understand him we still stay away.
						nuances of relationships is still not fully known.
					Vidya vinayam dadati.
						Ignorance but arrogance means you don't want second opinion about you knowledge cuz of insecurity.
						Astrology has layers of knowledge - difficult to say sth for certain.
				Pandavas or Arjuna are typical devotees of Krishna - they are flexible for growing in life.
					Arjuna learnt all home skills in heavens when needed.
						MBA not getting job then jobless - st forced to do sth else.
						You should be ok to do to other things - savyasachi.
						wrestler given delicate things to play - can't do it - Arjuna player of gandiva could play vina also.
				Garbhadaan for Arjuna - ?n sanskars for psychological learning.
					Satyavati was told by Vyasa - your daughters will not be able to handle me - garbhadan sanskar.
					1 year fasting for Arjuna - heavens blessing.
					Solutions in MMN - MOI is black magic, MOP - elaborate puja thru 7 else and wearing jewels. MOG - mantra based - possible yes now also.
				Arjuna's predictions -
					always prediction on birth - constellation - all even LCM, and SP.
					janma kundali so purohit - pur + hit doer.
					Indra's predictions after Arjuna's birth
						he will be very favorable to the qualified.
							charity to qualified (investment for growth)
							downtrodden can be fed food but not charity.
							qualified does not stay with you
								people don't make qualified but grab qualified.
								qualified never follow people but principles if agreeable.
							Yudhisthir your qualification is people grow independently under you.
						transparent to educated class of people.
							370 abrogation is not celebration (euphoria) but a responsibility.
							after battle was over - sobriety in both parties after MB.
							Cricket and Bollywood makes you celebrate but educated qualified soldier is sober.
								he knows what's gained and what's lost.
						kind to cows, source of prosperity.
							Robert Clive wanted to destroy Indian economics to make Indians beggars.
							So destroyed 2 crores cows.
							Idea was make them dependent on us. See how far the thinking goes.
							Bhukhe pet se bhajan nahi hoga - that's truth - can't talk philosophy to flood victims.
							cow, farms, grains, nourishment, vigor or rigor - all connected.
							1 farm person - 6 months cow milk then alcohol becomes very unattractive.
							Ayurved talks about madyapaan as a tool - winter in extreme - but not for sadhakas.
							western know art of drinking - drink very little for socializing vs drinking in glasses like water.
							Cow brings shakti, buddhi and compassion.
						well wisher of eb.
							sabka saath, sabka vikas - but how should be known.
						cause pain to the enemies.
							our ahimsa has a place for himsa also.
							Give us even 5 villages and we will be satisfied otherwise our armies also ready.
						give pleasure to the afflicted.
							even enemies.
				no facilities for sanskars for pandavas.
					Vasudev sent purohit Kashyap (Kashmir comes from him - his native) to shatasringa mountains.
					Kashyap performed all samskars - garbhadaan, chuda karan, upanayanam, etc.
				Pandavas represent DAKM - 4 purusharthas.
					Arjuna represents prosperity, Yudhisthir represents dharma, Bhima represents Kama
					Nakul Sahadev represent Mukti.
					Draupadi reconciled all of them together.
					Material prosperity is focus? spiritually poor you get.
					artha also may mean poor relationships.
					Lakshmi of 8 kinds - vijay, dhan, saubhagya lakshmi, arogya, etc.
						people only focus on artha lakshmi and don't get others.
					Chanakya - sukh ke mool mein dharma hai.
						sukh from dharma from artha from Rajya
						from sense control from humility from serving elders.
						REL - arajakta - Kashmir - when impoverished, people can be bought for stone pelting.
						Rajya means no personal life.
						Maharaj word used for sanyasis - cuz nth for me but for others and also ruler of senses.
						Dharma + Murti procreated Nara + Narayan.
				Vedic training is in all fronts
					kshatriya king also has to clean goshala, etc.
					brahmin, kshatriya both gotta learn climbing the trees also.
					Sahadev, Nakul climbed - can't expect today's polician to climb a tree in their youth
						how distant are you from ground reality.
						If lost war then run into forest - must have learnt to live there.
						Eg - Maharana Pratap, Shivaji.
					BG not telling the knowledge but reconfirmation of knowledge already known ?as a flow of thought.
						Vedas and Upanishads are like sugarcane and BG like sugarcane juice.
						nyaya, grammar so much to do - only Max mueller's book is not vedas - that's propaganda.
						Retire not mentally - spirit remains although work handed over to children ?more of a guide.
				Talents cultivation
					under Drona
						Bhima - mace; Yudhisthir javelin. Madri sons - sword fighting. Arjuna - savyasachi expert in archery.
						Arjuna inclination and potential for martial arts also.
					Arjuna didn't think education is over
						40-50 in IT doesn't make you expert.
						Mature over time - even cooking of every day is greater than stage performance of Britain's got talent.
							No gas, no control mechanism but Jagannath Puri same taste.
							Cooking is an art not work.
						Next teacher has to be superior else boring.
							teachers don't like questioners - not creating learners but machine.
				Arjuna 1 crore Gayatri to have capacity to handle Pashupatastra
					Drona giving you cuz you can control your mind.
					can't handle if given too early then burn out.
				Pandavas life was movement and pause
					that's desirable not only movement.
					1 vastu - IIM is great architecture that people from world come to see
						but here they must use AC and can't open window.
					ew there should space and structure - only structure is scary.
					Stomach should have both, mountains should have.
					Musics should have pause also - continuous music causes pain.
					Never settled in 1 forest - never dominated ecosystem - animals get disturbed.
					Tourist mindset in village is gratify here.
						they want facilities and never become part of the ecosystem.
					Shivaji no palace but only fort - Jijabai below but no palace for Krishna dev ray.
					Taj Mahal is only a structure with no utility.
						Taj Mahal is on bank of Yamuna so creates disturbance in nature.
						Ajanta Alora - creating without destroying ecosystem.
					German architecture - awesome architecture but blocks air cuz cold there.
						It's counter productive in India especially the morning breeze.
						Good to look but difficult to stay.
					Heritage buildings in Mumbai - structure and space after removing all and have 1 building.
					Don't impose your culture on others.
						Krishna wanted Yudhisthir to be the king cuz he won't impose.
				Arjuna attacked by Gandharva - Ganga is for e1 (action as per vidya)
					Ranganath story is there but Varadraj not there attacked by Mughals.
					If deities damaged or destroyed then make new ones is vedic principle.
					But sentiment that worshipped by Ramanuja and Yamuna.
					Somnath is not original shivaling - ghazini destroyed it.
					Hamsavatar - even avatars become irrelevant over time.
					Freshness is required.
					Western ghats protection - Forestation but foolishness - grow plants which are not native to that place.
					land doesn't handle it - then prakriti ka prakop it seems but it's manipulating inaptly.
					Pandavas as tapatyas - Bharatas Kurus I know but what's this.
				Krishna doesn't oppose Arjuna's reasons but only conclusion.
					shraadh means gratitude.
					Politicians suggested farmers to kill cows after milk is stopped - utility principle and not family principle.
						Hitler saw people from utility principle - finish off useless people.
						That very utility friendliness becomes burden to society.
					Your experiences can't be imposed on others cuz different SecurityConfiguration
						so share what you do and why but don't impose.
					Knowledge means what to do but Krishna's style - Kriya and parinam - let them decide.
						Krishna only talking maths - 2+2=4, etc and then you decide.
						Better act as per your nature.
						stats and probability - your action and your results.
						Don't tell Krishna make me escape trouble of 12 years - if I enter, I get reaction.
							Ask Krishna gimme strength.
							sb forced me is not an excuse - it's still your responsibility, choice - idiot plays victim card.
				1 more vidya from Ulupi
					My dear husband, you will never be defeated in waters.
					You will be unconquerable even in waters.
					7 lakes that sages won't enter cuz crocodiles - Arjuna said I will enter np.
						He is not stupid - not adventure without logic.
						Only daring is problem. Too much care - then scared to heart attack seeing cockroach.
						?Dare, care, score
						Unfortunate life to not experience injuries in childhood.
						No self reliance is the problem.
						Diverse relationship should be experienced.
						Retrieved apsaras and gave them their original form.
				Arjuna intense Tapasya for Paashupatastra from Lord Shiva
					Chanakya - vidya and sukh don't come in a combo.
						College join but ac checking b4.
						tapasya is biggest asset of youth.
						vidya isn't algorithm but wisdom - not information but transformation.
					reduced frequency of fruits over days till only wind like Dhruva.
						stood on his toes.
						developed jata which was shining like lightning.
							all energy of tapasya is channeled in braid.
						those who are settled they are disturbed by tapasya - Shiva knew the purpose so don't worry.
				Now to heavenly planets
					to not enjoy but get learning.
					only eg of going to even heavens for learning and not enjoying.
					Arjuna learnt and came back to home
						Pak says clash of civilization - no, clash of faith.
						roots are the same arabs attack and we keep same names as them.
						that's why they come back cuz must find your roots.
						cuz rin to be paid back so must come back.
				However great you are you still have limitations
					and that's nothing to be ashamed about.
						Rupa G - devotee is not one who never makes mistakes
						but courage to take shelter irrespectively.
					Arjuna had outburst on killing Drona.
						alleged Yudhisthir to be materialists.
						sentiments but not backed by buddhi.
						budha bhav samanvita - you killed Drona like Ram killed Vali.
						Krishna not angry cuz it's emotional outburst.
					Willingness to learn
						vs Duryodhan not willing to learn
						For times to come he is saying that I accept that I am confused.
							so honest and courageous Arjuna is.
						Arjuna once asks Krishna to repeat what he said in BG
							Oh how could you forget - let me say something else. Anugita - double the size.
						LCM also - atmaram verse can you explain - oh, 1 mad man affected other; I don't recall.
							!Where is trust in Krishna's creation - more protection from worldly systems than Krishna.
				!Do teerth - illusioned mind gets stabilized.
					teerth means meet sadhu.
				Came back to earth with all the talents.
					for every discipline there is a way to crack it - trust is very important.
					Arjuna even proposed but wanted to come back from heavens.
					Krishna to Arjuna with profuse talents - not to display but to use.

	<Ramayan> Ref Amarendra Pr; Gauranga Pr (Ram Katha and Hanuman series), Krishna dharma Pr book.
		Application - ?Relationships, ?Dharma.
		<GovindPr>
		Lecture 1 - Ramayan - when vs what is there?
			Facility for imagining - history made s.t boring - not fiction or fact but impact.
			Movie on how they made a movie so his struggles to write the literature so participant there.
			Vyasadev in MB - but appears there although writer.
			arrogant, crazy or humble to write himself in the book - Valmiki is humble.
			People choose tragedy stories as heros - you become what you think - Arjuna had tragedy but success himself not others - Ekalavya and Karna not successful.
			Krishna asked for boon from Agni - not tu kya dega but in relp you reciprocate - deep friendship with Arjuna. Arjuna asked for divine weapons ensuring Krishna won't misunderstand.
			Perversion to see others team's defeat - choose worst players - Ramayan uses best characters.
			value vs valuable - not vastu but vaastav based.
			300 versions of Ramayan - Valmiki - heart breaking for brahmins and need to break hearts for kshatriya.
				100 version of ramayan - many slanderous - even court case why project Valmiki's version.
				Ram devotee's heart will break - why highlight Valmiki's? (10:00)
				Scholar - agnostic, atheistic, doubtful, dry grammarian (concept > grammar) - absorption makes you transcend page number. 1 with content.
					kshatriya would break their heart.
					alphabets, words, grammar lose their identity to enhance the purpose of Ramayan.
					@orchestra - all have presence but lose themselves for higher.
				Substance internally and externally. If no understanding but only aggression then fanatic.
				Rasikas - relishable
					yet no conflict with siddhanta.
						Raavan - try to find good in evil people. Endorsing that people can get away with crime. Eg - Human resource people come many times - his past or sth.
					Eb is good. God's wish eth happened - Then where's free will.
					overemphasis on greatness of God.
				Ravan told st - fell on feet or Duryodhan I wanna do good - Jiva has good tendency but doesn't stay - but punishable still.
				ordinary poets - have kalpana but not darshan - siddhanta distorted.
			Spirituality done wrongly affects society badly is a fact
			Why - reasons for writing
				Niti - game, wealth, teach practical interactions, gain freedom from curses and disease, achieve moksha, teach and transform others.
				Sahitya academy, jnanapeeth, etc.
				King reads your content and recognition - then prasiddhi.
				Intel -> arrogance. So stay fool? Envious otherwise. So, intel would be ignored in past.
				children you can be flexible but adult in arrogance so why attention to me, etc. So learning best at children even scold and they forget but learn.
				No flattery for psychological growth of child. Ram praising Hanuman was against it.
				Gurukuls run by grihastas - not sanyasis and brahmacaris - no love and harsh bad for them - efficiency by males and affection from females. Dualities of life to experience.
				murti are shaped fast but deities take lots of time - patience.
				certs but not skills
			(10:00)
			<SitaKalyanam>
				Sita Kalyanam
				<IntroNVishwamitraIntent>
				Corona Phase
					Newton saw matter. Einstein saw energy ew.
					All activities closed so MOG on rise.
					competition for seat - survival of fittest like animals.
					Peacock showing up.
					Poison for 1 - nectar for another and vv.
						they also feel the pain but feel happiness also.
					Arjuna - How can I see you in matter. Seeing spirit in matter - learn that art.
						Nowadays, people see even God in matter - that's mayavad
					Nature belongs to Krishna - st it shows up that I belong to not you but ishwar.
						Showing Ramayan to children - lockdown time I saw Ramayan.
						Chanakya says
							Intel talk about gambling in morning (life is gambling)
								MB in morning.
							Ramayan stri prasangat - in afternoon.
							Evening - Krishna's pastimes
				Shiva and shakti - can't separate 1 from other.
					shakti and shaktiman.
					fulfill each other.
					prakriti and purush.
					Chandra and surya nadi during anulom vilom are the inseparable.
					prana and rasa come together for progress.
					Daya and nyaya - come together. Can't talk kindness without justice and vv.
					LCM was kind and soft like petals but st hard as thunderbolt.
					Parashuram was without lakshmi - he was nyaya without daya.
					for vaman, lakshmi was hidden under his deerskin.
						Bali is my dev but moving towars hiranya's side.
						Bali wanted to be big like China - consumer not cooperator but had sanskars of prahlad.
					That's why we don't worship only male god - male and female together.
						these 2 meeting together is kalyan - meeting of the 2.
						Even gods worship - other religions think of marriage as contract for utility but hindu doesn't think so.
						Hindus currently think marriage as event to be managed.
						celebrating event of marriage - real tapasya is being married
						Vivah - lakshmi aa rahi hai and now these days don't know much she would ask.
					so many - tulsi vivah, chidiya, 27 nakshatra for moon - shukla and krishna paksha,
						agni and svaha
					Dharma and Daksha's daughters in SB
						dharma and shraddha -> shubha
							foolishness - delhi assembly in mosque - faith in God but blind.
							If sick, shok then don't visit temples - assembly but be god conscious, think, satsang, etc.
						dharma + maitri -> Prasad.
							Complete satisfaction.
						Dharma + daya -> abhay.
							bhaya otherwise.
						Dharma + shanti -> Sukh.
							1947 largest migration - sindhis left hometown.
							Mumbai flood and suicide.
						Dharma + tushti -> muda (delight)
						Dharma + Pushti - assured identity - svabhimaan
							being Indian, devotee, etc not insecure with it.
						Dharma + Kriya -> Yoga
							Yoga with yukta practices based on dharma.
							Disciplined life - among yogis, bhakti is best - bhakti without yogi is eventually a rogi.
							Even recreation but yukta.
						Dharma + unnati -> Darpa (Confidence)
						Dharma + buddhi -> artha
							anartha otherwise.
						dharma + medha -> smriti.
						dharma + titiksha (Patience) -> Kshema (well being)
							exploitation without it.
						Dharma + Hri (Shyness) - Prashraya / sabhyata - gentle and refine.
						dharma + murti -> Shriman Narayan.
							badrinath - there this vivah took place.
					Kula parichay - ayodhya - jise jeeta nahi jaa sakta.
						sita can't be ordinary to be married there.
						Traditional families also - girls dowry became compulsory
							Marriage became contract from sanskar - from dowry to love marriage.
							Liking based on most ordinary event in life.
							Marriage should be based on compatibility.
						Scriptures say - If you follow will of shastra, can experience satyug even in kali yug.
						Vivah - vishishta rupern vah iti.
					Nimi and vasishtha - didn't want body, body manthan.
						essence of nimi was janak - result of manthan.
						He was nishkam karma yogi. Vaidehi - 1 name of sita - not attached to body.
						nagnajita - conquered nakedness, shamelessness.
						Sita Ram marriage can't be compared to anything but themselves - Lakshmi Narayan.
					Vishvamita angry - Vishitha did giving name ceremony but I have to do the marriage ceremony.
				</IntroNVishwamitraIntent>
				<VeerShulkaVivah>
					Ram astitva is in e1's heart - what more proof do you want.
					What valmiki wrote were as it is revelation to whatever actually happened.
					Daksha and Shivji relationship - Daksha represents srishti and shivaji represents samhar.
						They are bound to conflict - creation or destruction but ?coexistence.
						Sati broke her relation with father thru body - so left body - not suicide but separation.
						and met shivji thru her samhar.
					Tataka not immediately killed - not punishable immediately.
						Stri tadan ke adhikari but shastras don't agree.
						Vishvamita and Parashuram were black and white but Ram would think and act.
					Maricha was not killed - my basic work won't be done.
						he had become sadhu.
						Ahalya had become stone - over ambitious - controlled by senses, our heart becomes like stone.
					The same dhanush or bow was passed down to janak - 30 wrestlers would carry.
					Sita originated from earth and ended into earth.
						Sita was not from womb.
					Draupadi says - Purusharth, Daiva, Ishwar Ichha.
					Marriages types - veer shulka (find superior guy), Svayamvar, Vivah, Gandharva Vivah.
						no matter how feminist you still want a hubby superior to you.
						Veer eg - Pay the price thru challenge.
							Sita, Draupadi, Krishna also Rukmini, Nagnajiti, Vrishabh; challenge to control 7 bulls - Krishn adid.
							Also Rakshasa vivah abduct.
					What all to be done - Shiva shakti to be defused, Parshuram to be rested, Nyaya and kripa combo to start.
					Ram saw and extracted all power of bow.
						Arjuna - let me see in BG ch but Ram also wanted to see.
						not that all people tried but Ram did it directly. Why Veer shulka Janak wondered - he has to be husband.
						Curious to touch not string also said Vishvamita.
						Powerful weapon of destruction - picking it is a big deal.
						Cracking - all fainted but not Sita. Ram indicating that in future, a lots is gonna happen by Ram.
					Vivah - not 2 but families. I was curious to see - not for marriage although you are ready but still gotta ask my family.
						love marriage should have consent and understanding of parents. Arranged should have liking and acceptance of children - not good otherwise.
						Attracted to Sita. Not the shadow on earth.
							Parikrama but plastic thrown - We want Ram without Sita - that's disrespect.
							We won't throw into Ganga if we see connection.
						Janak sent message to Dashrath - don't play with time factor - wait for it - don't force it.
							Deal with your emotions all the while.
							Waiting for marriage and then immediately marriage.
							Balaji sankalpa for 1 year and takes 20-30 days and that eagerness trains your consciousness.
							close your eyes - 30 sec darshan for either case - but such deep for those who kept waiting.
							Surrendering isn't leave all work and go to Krishna - Rupa G explains it properly.
							Corona teaches us patience
							Prayas Pariksha says Rupa G.
						Ashwamedh - roam and should be not taken away.
							Counter eg - sadar M and Indra arrested the horse and got children killed. So Bhagirath for uddhar brought ganga.
							Sweet rice - why 1/4, 1/8 - Kaikeyi would be angry - that's maths wrong not 1/3.
							Kaushalya ka shesha - after providing to Ram. Left over - 12 months later - purna.
							Rama ka shesha Lakshman and so forth.
							Test tube - not relationship centered but preserve for 10 years - will work now - tamper with nature.
							Taj Mahal - not much evidence so take as it is but so much violence for it.
								it is result of exploitation - looks good but so much violence.
							Ajanta caves - Sages and saints - Yajna for 1000 years to develop with tapasya.
								Sun rises and watch reflection - make that much.
								A culture dedicated to make it. This churns your heart.
							Very eager but on arrival, no midnight meeting but wait for next day and all arrangements.
						Traditional marriage or love marriage is stupidity - no logic or scriptures - only ego or emotions - both hit hard the people.
							didn't break the protocol of parents - parents who raised - svayamvar but not svayamvadhu.
							Such marriage - Social sensitivity, psychology, culture and spirituality.
								that's why we celebrate these marriages.
							Sita used to walk with Ram or behind Ram - not mindless reckless freedom but wisdom based.
								Yaksha prashna - yudhishthir said wife is best friend.
								so open that Ram was called impotent by Sita.
								cries also cuz woman but gives reason and also scolding.
						I will do what I should do and your parents told about what you should - that's my fortune.
							Both talked responsibilities and not rights - unlike today.
							Rath and Rathi; Paan and Supari - like they left.
						What's our family they discussed.
				</VeerShulkaVivah>
				<MarriageOfFamilies>
					Vivah - Vahan - present times is like 2 tyres cycle vs car with 4 cycles - more power, more robust and able to handle tough roads.
					Dashrath and Vashish tell Ram lineage - Many great people in the line.
						Ikshvaku - Prithu - Mandhata, Sagar, Anshuman,
						Dileep, Bhagirath, Kakusthat, Raghu, Ambarish, Nahush, Yayati.
						Naabhag, Aja, Dashrath, Shri Ram
					Bhagirath Prayas
						Sagar was given poison but became immune to poison - don't know how true.
							his horse for ashwavmedh was kidnapped by Indra.
							Pratyaksha and made anuman that he has arrested - but no shabda - so rishi must have stolen.
							Agni kriya not possible cuz burnt by fire.
						Was ganga not there at that time? Vikaas karna - nature is very dynamic - tourist place but culture gone overtime.
							kishkindha or hampi - even 1 year changes so much.
							?Vrindavan was excavated by Gs. Krishna took them to Dwaraka - Kushavarta.
							Migration was very convenient - painful in 1947 sindhis or punjabis all suffered.
							Ganga was already there b4 gone happens. Just like cities and villages over time.
						penance by Anshuman, Dileep, Bhagirath - vyakti parivaar ke pratinidhitva mein doing it.
							It's a legacy of endeavor.
							1857 fight - but great failure. kept fighting and finally in 1947 we got after 90 years cuz never lost hope.
							In 1000 years our ancestors could lose culture and gain other traditions that allow cow slaughter but they didn't - feel proud of them.
							Ganga promised will come but who will tolerate my vega.
							Samhaar shakti can be controlled by Shiva so prayed to him as well
							bridge made by Shiva's jatas and went till pataal.
							Benefits for all others and coming generations also.
							Sugriva ajna or bhagirath prayas such efforts are called.
					Janak tells his parampara
					Kanya daan - Godan, Bhumi, til, suvarna
						How can a girl be donated? is he an object?
						Gita says only supatra should give donation - donation giver is superior or taker.
						Giver is superior - Giver says that now it's not mine - na mama - not mine anymore.
						But daughter is always child of parents - shakti or lakshmi banane ke kshamata.
						Kul deepika is given to others - na mama by giver but mahi by taker.
						Taker is yogya and giver is mahaan - no1 is superior.
						Alcoholic given lots of money won't know what to do with it.
						Vivah now are events not sanskars.
						st Brahmins given donation even kingdom donated but returns that you better manage it.
						Nowadays, daan or fees to cricketer or singer in wedding.
					Rishi means seer. Mahrisi vashishta - Mahrishi means great seer of AT - in this but not of this world.
						He asked for Bharat and Shatrughna also.
						Bharat's mama also came - not like shakuni.
						Pitri puja.
						ISRO chariman or sanskrit teacher very less income but cricket chairman or bat mover gets so much paid.
						Muhurta is decided not based on weekend for more people but what's good.
						Krishna freed them - what's hope for us said 16K ladies - what can I do
							Satyabhama suggested that marriages and people allege Krishna for being lusty.
							3K for Akbar then great but Krishna becomes womanizer.
							Krishna expanded to 1:1 wives. not consistent in argument and logic that they refuse to accept this.
							?His expansion indicates that he could do it cuz he could expand but not eb can expand their energies.
					After hand given then Sita could be seen by Ram otherwise only shadow till then.
					Janak also said mama Suta - but this mama-ta is not same as Dhritarashtra's mama ka pandavashcaiva.
						Nishkaam KY - 7 said your place is burning - no that's not mine he said so was well aware.
						you can't give up I me and mine but it has to be expanded that's the idea - vasudhaiva kutumbakam is the idea.
						Porus gave food to enemy - that's the culture - Alexander you won't starve them to death - no we will defeat them to death but dharma centered.
						that mama is for bhumi devi - e1 connected to my jurisdiction. She is lakshmi.
					Sita vipralambha is rasabhasa but our philosophy is very deep to see connection and disconnection.
						Sita is burning your lanka cuz she is fire and you are maintaining her like this.
						Ravan is burning by his sinful acts not that Sita is burning.
					Sisters - Sita, Urmila, Step sisters - Mandavika and Shrutakirti.
						Pradakshina, agni, vedi.
						kanya dhan was given after all this without previous plans
						But voluntary gifting is good. no compulsion of sinful dowry. That became part of culture.
				</MarriageOfFamilies>
				<ParshuramFinishesKalyanam>
					Vishwamitra - Name got justified after this.
						Sutra dhar - director or author knows how much weightage to give to each character.
						So much anartha to kul guru vashishta in past - finally done.
						Will you make peace or pieces is bound to happen - Krishna to Vidur - karma ke parinaam are not in our hands.
							This will to act and acting to do the necessarily is itself pious said Krishna.
						Vishwamitra nowhere to be repeated again. Just like Manthara - very little role.
							sweet rice and 1 drop of ink spoils it all.
						Pride that I did it spoils it all so a service done in humility.
						Accepting dowry is a sin - it's a properly of the lady only.
					Dvandva shakun witnessed by Dashrath.
						BG starts from Ch2 with bhagavan's song.
						World of duality is experienced by every jiva - even if PD like pandavas, Kunti, etc.
						They get capacity to withstand but not that they change.
						Nature can clean itself - we need mercy to ourselves and align.
						Samudra vasane devi...many do that.
						Jalandhar is 250 Km away but could see Himalaya from there.
						Material world is not only right or wrong - it's both.
						Vashishta said we would experience both peace and fear.
						Sensitive to nature can catch these omens but not e1 so can't play around.
					Parashuram shows up.
						Most of the people fainted except heros.
						Where there's love, logic gets sidelined so Dashrath forgot that Ram is SPOG and felt fear.
							st criminal's mother says that execute the spoilt child but still cries.
						Parshu simply said you broke it. So this is Vishnu dhanush.
							Again shaivism vs vishnuism!? Creation is not done for destruction.
								Creation is for stability and give purpose to e1. Shivaji after all.
								That's why avatar for only maintenance once.
								Temple making or destroying is easy but maintaining isn't.
								Maintaining govt is difficult than making one.
								need justice and also compassion.
							The breaking was not necessary was his point.
								told the history.
					Parshu was angry and Dashrath apparently feared.
						Kshatriyas can't forgive et.
						Bhargavji you are brahmin so not saying anything - see my parakrama.
						Ram was tough also - killed tataka when necessary; accepted challenge of parshu.
						Brahmin would attack Shivaji et after Afzal Khan defeated. He warned but he attacked again and again.
						Ram stringed it and took the bow and now tell what shall I destroy
						2 powers of Parshu - Tapa and Gaman (go anywhere) - I gotta go to Mahendra parvat
						so removed his tapan shakti - all credits removed.
					Ramayan Views
						Ramayan is conflict of how high you can go and how high - Ravan, Ram, Vibhishan, etc.
							Ram is not just a leader.
							KK are so amazing that people just need to hear it from right person, books
						Nakshatra - born in particular nakshatra.
							so powerful Ram was. Friendship etc - not commoners cuz so much renunciation.
							Not easy to be related to SPOG in his pastimes - can't be narrow minded but broad minded.
							Huge sacrifices it demands - eg Krishna's parents, etc.
						Maricha bigger or Garuda - who killed by whom and serving whom - what's the weightage.
							Maricha took the name at death but consciousness was not favorable but unfavorable.
							Garuda died connecting the 2.
						Many marriages are kalyankari - Prithviraj - I must marry the sanyukta
							and jayachand in anger sold off to take revenge. Calling M Gauri.
							Leader can't choose whom to marry - Rajiv Gandhi can't marry Sonia - says Chanakya - cuz her goodwill is bound to be with her country.
							can love yes but can't marry.
						King wanted to married a lady - she said being brahmin can't deal with politics and conspiracies.
							King attacked crossed boundaries so states fought and lady committed suicide.
							When spark meets cotton, it's not 1 and 1 making 2 but all ash.
						When returning to Ayodhya.
							Ram saw redness in sky and remembered sacrifice of Jatayu and tears came to him.
					Dwaraka Lila - Sita is bold and wrote a letter to save me.
						Mandodiri great girl but her father conspired to marry her and she stayed miserable.
					HN is eternal connection of Radha Krishna and Sita Ram
						so it's kalyan utsav - it is to be taken and shared.
					QA - Astrology I know philosophy but not practice
						won't understand family social dynamics but only maths.
						Take their help but not shelter - VA is supportive system not a shelter.
						Goal vs means - upah vs upakaran.
						Uttardayitva is always yours - not one who suggested.
						Do we ever find in Ramayan refering charts and then doing nothing.
						Kaam is not maithun sukh but enjoyment in KC way.
						Now our specific questions of gonna go foreign or honeymoon for a year or not - difficult to answer.
					QA - How Dashrath married to ladies from different countries.
						Videsh and different states is different.
						Himalaya to ocean is bharat - root of arya civilization.
						Arya and Dravida divisions are mentioned in CC but part of bharat only.
						So, civilization was 1.
						Krishna Devray married Pratap Rudra's daughter after friendship. Bijapur understood he won't be with us.

			Spirit - Story told with transcendental reasoning, sanskrit, lessons - and further pastimes supporting the lesson.
				Trans includes allegories, more than earthly vision - karma reactions so this happened, heavens what was going on, what Krishna wanted etc
			<HowRamayanAsScriptureStarts>
			L1 - How Ramayan as scripture starts.
				People know more tech than Rama Krishna. What else to do in evening.
				only 2 chapters you must have heard enough about him.
				Krishna all attractive used to listen about Rama.
				Culture names that have all names RamKrishna bala subramaniam. Ref of person.
				Revive the culture of hearing - how all good qualities - Krishna himself comes in heart and cleans the dirt.
				@uproot leaves will turn yellow some time; fan switched off but it will move for some time.
				@baby dirty under shower will be clean in a very short time.
				Bring mind back - name syllables, bhajan, shlokas, NGRL, etc.
				Yamaraj - bring those who have never heard Krishna and leave those who have heard just once.
				Hear, Glorify, remember, worship - 4 things to connect with Krishna.
				As if Krishna is doing austerity to take darshan.
				Mediums of mercy seen as mediums of punishment - cuz Krishna's hand is not seen.
				Ram Katha in different languages - the root composition is valmiki.
				Tulsidas refs ramcharitmanas in north but not famous in south cuz awadhi.
					I have ref of many authors, scriptures, etc and also valmiki as base - writing for my happiness outpour in simple language.
					some say verse in shastra that valmiki shows up as tulsidas.
				Heaven ram katha has 100 crore verses. can solve greatest sins.
					Great people do it for others - cow doesn't drink its own milk - dividing syllables across 3 worlds - 2 syllables left - Rama.
					Rama = Radha Krishna = Radha + Madhusudan. (?Radharaman)
					24K verses for only Rama - 18K for different devs and all incarnations. MB - 1 lakh for itihas.
						halwa in hand as prasadam is vaishnava aparadh in ISKCON.
						All 10 incarnations - 10 mins for others but Rama katha for hours.
				Krishna is tough syllables to chant his name.
					he walk, actions, glances is crooked. Thief of butter from neighbors but owner of eth - who is thief.
					liberation you want - understand pastimes in truth!
					Then in BG he says be simple and straight forward.
					syllables from vishnu sahasranam to Narayan to Govinda to Rama (that's it) - can't make it one om.
					Ramayan - poetic style and expression like cookoo and depth like lion.
				Valmiki asks Narad Muni - anyone in world with 16 qualities - gunavaan not dhanvaan - Ram.
					Japa goes to places it is attached there.
					see always Krishna - internal or external energies of Krishna.
					chaturvyuh as 4 bros.
					Chitrakoot like Vrindavan - Lord frolicked. Ram vs Krishna loving dev fights.
						Ram is great but Krishna ate mud and all. So, more fun loving.
						Krishna attached then goes to mathura but Ram takes monkeys to ayodhya.
					mad elephant story - tulsidas stood his ground - faith in Rama name
						Tulsidas asked a Krishna devotee you didn't trust Krishna's protection?
						He said - I was thinking should Lord serve me or vv
				Ram Rajya no weather extremes, no mental problems, collaborations, smile solves problems, etc.
					These days center is not Ram but Kam.
					1 celeb said - sandwich on belly doesn't satisfy but tasting so taste Rama katha and not material accumulations.
					Asked Valmiki to compile Ramayan.
					SM and obedient disciple => explosion of katha - SB, Ramayan, BG.
				Valmiki bathing - how will I fulfill. Eg - SP - How will I do it - help will come said BSS.
					All of you are made to take birth here - you are telling me how to be a good disciple.
					KDK empowerment - garland, dream that I will help.
			</HowRamayanAsScriptureStarts>
			<KranchStoryAndPutreshti>
			L2 - Kraunch story and Putreshti.
				9.11.23 - great controller enjoyer when hears, goes beyond envy and stays in world but not karma.
				good material action leads to good reaction and reaction binds us to the world.
				Chaurashtakam - no more birth cuz no more milk in next life.
				Ramji - 27 when banished +14+44 rule after exile.
				guru akshare twice time to say - he is my guru but whether I am become his disciple I don't know.
					Aligning to the degree is as per me then where is surrender as much as we like.
					BSS work had signature of his SM.
					CC - what name have u given driving me nuts.
					Radhanath Swami - Diksha mantra is powerful fills heart with love.
				yamuna can't cross - Krishna is brahmacari then give way.
					Durvasa served - used both hands. Boon - unconditional DS for Krishna. How cross yamuna.
					Controlled senses equally satisfied. Accepts in devotion.
					Gopis from Radha and Radha from heart of Krishna - baby enchanted by his own reflections.
				Kraunch is subspecies of crane or baka or bagula.
					Sex life attachment comes griha, child, relatives, vitta. Bodily egos.
					Dogs trespassers will be prosecuted.
					Male killed by arrow and female confused. PD - soft as butter but melts on heat not true. But hurt 7 else then agitated.
					Curse. Why did I become so angry, that's not like a dev.
					With crane death, Brahmaji on swan has appeared so auspicious - na shobhate hans madhye bako yatha.
					Parikshit cursed by brahmin - accepted by the one who had seen Krishna in womb. That's a devotee - qualities.
						labcoat doesn't make you scientist. Or shirt makes soldier so external as dev but qualities.
						jada bharat - durga devi kills her devs.
						Prahlad never said bad father. These days people say. See what a dev is.
					Use this meter to compose shastra - I inspired this verse from you.
					sits in dhyan for revelations.
						baal gandharva for singing. apsara for dancing. Lava kusha learnt Ramayan and sang to Rama.
						Hari katha is so amazing even hari wants to hear it.
					ethiopia - lavadveep and kushadveep - earth into 2. Kushaites - present day africa.
					Goloka singers - snigdha and madhu kantha - kuvera children - after deliverance. May we see Krishna.
					10.10.28 SB shloka.
				putra - pun + tra. Putra kameshti yajna - first class rishi.
					sanat kumar hari satha said about dasharath - he must have told rishi name.
					Rishyashringa story - no meeting females. But king romapad get rains from - bring him here so send females.
					purush vikar on meeting them. Insignificant portion of fruits we have there. Goes to kingdom and it rains there.
					Radhanath Swami didn't think of women for 8 years in new vrindavan.
					Rishyashringa married and tell father should not be angry.
					Villains ready - Brahma beseeches and Lord appears. Demigods start to appear and I will appear.
					Appear in 3 species - white monkey, brown monkey, bears.
			</KranchStoryAndPutreshti>
			<MultipleMeaningsAndKheer>
			L3 - Multiple meanings and Kheer
				Multiple meanings of the valmiki shloka
					ma nishad had layers of meaning. Like Indra's cussing words on Krishna.
					ut + danda (up stick - showy)
						Indra thought Krishna is talkative - Indra thinking himself as center of attraction.
						Many adjectives used for Krishna. Thinks of himself as pandit.
						pandit maninah as so pandits believe. ajna - nothing remains to be known instead of you know nothing.
					Gopis saying you are not son of yashoda - parokshavad very dear to Krishna - not philosophy.
						you must not be son of yashoda - crying son and she thinking I should help him but you don't.
						supersoul is only witness does not help drowning person.
						So, Oh, Krishna you must be paramatma - you can see us but we can't see you.
					This shloka has Ramanayan scripted in it - kalidas ma's that not steady - ma (laxmi), mano, madhupo, etc.
					Meaning - nishad - residence place of laxmi so ram
						may you stay always in pratisha.
						Ravana kraunch who hit with lust - approaching sita will be killed by Ram who is abode of mother Sita's love.
						while Ravana is intertwined with Mandodiri heart to heart like crane birds.
				Kheer - 50-25+12.5-12.5 - All incarnations as 4 - 4 bros and Jagannath Baladev Subhadra Sudarshan but kali as 5.
					2 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 5.
					Why 4 JBSS - Guru gives mercy to those who have not. Krishna gives mercy to those based on credits.
						Baladev representing guru tattva comes to alter first.
						desire to see the lord rises - su darshan - desire to see Krishna's hand in life. desire to see Lord.
						Curtain of maya removed and yoga maya gives and then Jagannath shows up.
					RLBS - These 4 bros also have meaning - 4 aspects of bhakti - that's cliffhanger.
						all avatars have purposes mentioned - agenda b4 they appear.
						Which university Ram studied to make bridge - Krishna is true karuna nidhi.
					We are never invited and have no agenda in this world.
						In middle ground we claim to be youth but born in stool and blood not kundals, only in middle we have possibility of proclaiming.
						Saci mother was glowing when gonna appear.
						after losing 7 children happy - how's that possible - cuz Krishna had come.
						and demons feel afraid when Lord appear.
						SP touching 1 devotee at gate didn't get up on time after dandavat - he started glowing
						all nakshatras align to Krishna - above astrology they are.
						3 mahaprabhus in Vrindavan - LCM, Vallabhacharya, Hari Vamsha (disciple of gopal bhatta G)
						Hari Vamsha says
							all auspicious signs in 1 chart is less than Krishna cuz that's only limited to 1 life.
							all inauspicious signs - give that signs to even me - if Krishna is there, there obstacle is limited to 1 life only.
						astorology important as science but not important after sincere bhakti - like 2+2 is not very important in high school.
						dhruva after austerity says brahma's abode as glass broken and Krishna is jewel - we think vv.
				madhu masa - spring - honey honey bee - so all about my devs.
					if not ekadashi then dwadashi but properly - he chose shukla paksha.
					navami is maryada tithi (Sita and Rama) if you miss the fast then nothing possible - cuz ekadashi next.
					why ashtami - human values Rama and Bhakti icing Krishna. Irresponsible devotion possible - premature paramahamsa principle.
					Middle of the 14 days so take middle path - take balanced approach.
					Time has to be picked now - muhurta important.
					Ravan vs Jatayu - chariot, heads number and weapons - beak servant; could not fight for you he says. I wanted to not defeat but delay muhurta.
					Last rite not done for vulture that he didn't do for father - 48 mins of bhakti is greater - we have 120 mins of japa ed.
					abhijeet - victorious externally or makes externals victorious. Rama victorious himself and made monkeys victorious.
					In middle of day he appeared - bhakti is top of head in priority then he appears.
					Krishna in middle of night - in problems of life, asking for help - Vasudev Devaki that no hope and Krishna appears after anarthas and guru tattva.
					we get sympathy from common people.
					Empathic listening and people thank you.
					Merciful incarnation of lord as HN - that dog meat eating and bear in hand but chant HK mocking devs chanting in streets.
			</MultipleMeaningsAndKheer>
			<What4BrosRepresent>
			L4 - What 4 bros represent
				Flowers offer frangrance thru wind to Rama on birth.
					too fast wind or too slow doesn' serve.
					@Indira Gandhi appearing so helicopter flowers and no beggars - even for PM of 1 country in this world.
					crying is normal on birth. Made to cry if not. Struggle et.
					sukh samriddhi apartment under construction. Uncooked sweet rice in world.
					Rama Lakshman in basket and Bharat Shatrughna in basket - when together they became happy - master servant makes happiness.
					SP you are dear to me - how dear - like freedom fighter or gandhi - better - cuz connected.
					Shiva drank poison - vish (poison) + ram (peace of mind, emanating of Rama) -> peace of mind.
						turmoils in world and chant ram => peace that's what Shiva did.
				HN - Parvati chants Ram and Lord Shiva gives his form - ardha narishwar form.
					Narsi Mehta - give me the best you have. Gave DS.
					CC - haram called but got BTG.
				Lakshman characteristics - filled with wealth from the name.
					he has wealth of Ram Bhakti
					Ram broke bow and eb got the consorts.
					He used to say let me check if forest temperature alright then you enter.
					Lakshman left his wife unlike Ram - busy serving Ram.
					thru all struggle and suffering for them. Shurpanakha - be wife of lakshman. Do you want mistress or be servant - lord then go to Ram so attacked Sita.
					Marich - Ram runs behind him and Lakshman stays back - they produce different voice. No1 can threaten Ram - you have been waiting for this right when Ram ain't there.
					You are Irresponsible for leaving Sita said Ram - Imagine his surrender. What more is there to continue - he does.
					What all he does for Ram and Sita and how testing - When jewels asked to be identified - I only identify the ankle bell not other ornaments.
					he stands for amanina manadena in SA. Unconditional service.
					Enough husband wife story - let me leave - never. That's principle of bhakti - austerity or luxury but service.
					Prabodhananda Saraswati - If whole identify me but Ram don't what's use; if none does but Ram ids then all gain.
					Some so poor that wealth is all they have.
					Fought with Indrajeet and who becomes hero - hanuman. Why my name not announced - setting score.
					Lakshman in background always serving. Anant always sees us says lakshmi so privacy (not principle in vaikuntha) - ok then Ram birth manthara conspiracy - but where anant - as lakshman still there so what's use she wonders.
					Shalyapurna listened by Ramanuja acarya - he already knows all pastimes but listens attentive - different caste but doesn't - curse to not be born as Brahmin if can't serve.
					His servants - Kuresh, dasharathi - deities back in bag - first deities and then padukas - first your deities then my deities. He smiled.
					Big competition to be served but no competition for service.
					SP has haridas Pr in Mumbai - KC shows broadcasted. He was pickpocket b4 KC.
						Devs merciful - wakes up for mangal arati and sleep themselves.
						asked SP I can't sleep - go shoo away the dogs - their sound comes in dictaphone.
					Hamsaduta Pr for sankirtan bus which gave sound every part except horn - education incomplete but enthusiasm is complete. So do editting service.
					Krishna tells tree as siksha guru for tolerance - fruits for others, tolerates weathers but gives shelter.
				Bharat characteristics - unsung hero - service without reciprocation. Bhakti is path of thorns.
					Bharat had russian mother - Kekeya desha - Russia - Rasia Krishna or Rishi desh.
					dasharath decided to step down - no bill produced like democracy rule is what king says.
					conspired against pandavas now go to Forest. So time very powerful.
					Ayodhya goes from victory to defeat. After 15K years (?astronomical evidence)
					Raven kicked Ashtavakra muni - monkeys will kick you back and defeat your kingdom.
					Angad on head and passed urine - more service than asked - I am vanar can do.
						Vali wrapping in tail - for gayatri - so make him friends.
						Vali finished by Ram - like needle passing thru banana.
						You can't even move me - my power chanted Ram - 10 heads, brains, 100 fingers move my feet - I don't touch monkeys feet.
						Indrajeet will try. Ravan - one who finds pleasure in giving torture to others.
					Ravan in our consciousness and Ram katha will win our heart.
						Dashrath has 10 senses under control - peaceful city ayodhya. Ravan miserable city lanka and makes cry.
					Dasharath announced and Ram corronated - e1 said right decision - he didn't get offended to undo his decision.
					Krishna told by Narad for pain in mathura and Krishna understood I am coming - 1 calf there enough to change his decision.
						Cricket fan - GN deity - umpires giving sixer so their devotees.
						India vs Pakistan in India who wins India or Pakistan - so that's love for cricket.
					Manthara saraswati on her tongue then why not bharat asks Indra
						if on tongue of devotee, then that will be serious offense and you know anger of Lord said Brahma.
						you know the story of durvasa.
					He was thought of as seed of conspiracy. Bharat M thought at least dasharath would understand.
						can I perform rites - no that's what he said b4 leaving better vultures eat my body.
						Let me renounce kingdom - some said genuine others said drama.
						Let me sleep below the ground and eat oats in cow urine. Living the life of forest that Ram's living.
					Bharat is one who did bhakti performing the bhaar or weight of misunderstanding thru his life.
						No NRGL of Lord even in ayodhya, then don't stay there.
					Lord walking with demigods is favor to them but walks among monkeys.
						you have every reason to reject us - no intellect, no bodily beauty but you are with us.
					We want Ram but needs unconditional service attitude of Laxman and tolerance of Bharat for him to appear.
						Madhusudan Pr to Africa - wanted to serve but taking service - serve in every condition or situation is the spirit - rubbing his head.
						Giriraj M - taking headache for Radha Giridhari in Mumbai.
				Shatrughna - bhakti completed by him.
					ahead object not movable - killer of shatru.
					killed the shatru of false ego.
					south indian commentators - served the servant vs laxman who was servant of master.
					Worship of my devotee pleases me far more says Krishna.
					stands for humility - when Krishna uses no anaesthesia to humble us
					humility - thru serving devs it comes.
					Jayapataka Swami's preaching doubled after his medical troubles.

			<HanumanInRamayan>
			L5 - Hanuman In Ramayan
				hanuman chalisa on rama navami
					you are lotus but honey bee to extract honey is more important to us cuz we can't tap honey from lotus ourselves.
					Impossible to describe Vaaman without Bali. Vishnu without Dhruva. Sudarshan without Ambarish. Likewise Hanuman.
					End with sweet after meal so hanumanji.
				Why Sundar Kand - Hanuman was very beautiful. Ramji also - so in the heart of the one love for that.
					one who connects energy with energetic becomes beautiful.
					Sita playing with ball stuck on tree - used bow to take it down - did you do that? - no I kept it back.
						If husband not strong enough then chatni - so at least be able to pick it with both hands.
						Ramji like best class - doing what the intent is so even broke the bow. Not just doing as much as asked.
						Sita with garland - I did what guru told me - blessings to get married.
					Sita represents luxury of world and Ramji as God so connector of the 2 is beautiful.
				Sun eating
					Sun represents enlightenment - run to eat the knowledge and realization and also gotta digest it.
					Spit sun out e1 says - when we rush for enlightenment e1 stops us from doing that. Fear of becoming sanyasi.
					Thunderbolt - different ways to allure the child.
					Away from shastra - then naughty child becomes - hanuman became.
					Sages saw the potential in child not naughtiness but misused - so cursed only to be reminded later.
					Good leader like jambavan
						leaders should not curse to snub potential
						leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.
					Hanuman goes like arrow of Ram - goes and do the needful and retires.
				I am Vayu and past credentials and contingency plans if jump fails
					but most importantly shelter of Ram in every situation.
				Parvat like grandchild - can't help but give luxury, love, gifts, appreciation.
					accept then purpose lost. Reject then ignoring sentiments.
					How to behave - thank you but on mission let me finish and then come and take rest.
					REL Akinchan Krishna Das - SP friend - I accept your gift but like it in your hand.
				Surasa - e1 should enter my mouth
					Hanuman excited can grow - becomes small and enters the mouth - met the condition.
					Atmosphere of Show bottle - stay humble
					Show off the size you are not - not happy and not confident about what we are - humility is to think of oneself less.
				Simhika - Hold ppl by shadow
					Sea monstress - our faults and flaws - busy holding the flaws in envy.
					Other anarthas can be dovetailed but not this one.
					Envy - NV = No Vacancy.
				Lankini - you can't enter.
					slapping maya. Happy she became and other cheek.
					Futuristic announcement - you can leave the service of Ravan and go away.
				Tulsi in Lanka - so devs in lanka - there was a devotee in Lanka.
					Sincerity finds its way.
					So, we are where our association is - Nabraska few devs.
					Great fortune to meet great devotee - I am performing bhakti around great devs.
					but you Vibhishan - teeth are sharp but you are like tongue soft around those.
					Seeing tulsi and identifying hindus in where public devotion not allowed and they are interested.
					Anyone can wear tulsi mala according to shastra - good qualities will show up.
					Tulsi and service - the magic will show up.
				?Searching Sita in chambers and thinking problem for brahmacari but Ram's service.
				Ashok Vatika - gonna commit suicide.
					Not scaring her by sudden appearance.
					bhakti, shakti and yukti all exist in hanuman.
					hanuman was very articulate with speech - so decided he will be messenger whenever needed.
						Speak truth but in palatable way.
					Shakes tree and sings glories of Ram.
					Many appearances have cheated her in past thru sights but never hear - so ear channel was best.
					sensitive to past
					who are you - most powerful then pride and other answer not truth - weakest in army of Ram and see what I will do - the whole chain is coming for you don't worry.
					How's my Ram - He is abode of eternal happiness then what will happen to Sita and if you say he is depressed and crying then what's the hope for her.
						He remembers good moments - but remembers you then finger ring can enter to wrist - which ring - here you are.
					once cold war between Sita Ram in forest - ring fell and Ram gave and Sita smiled - good it fell to make smile.
						ring had united when emotional distance. Now physical distance with his ring.
					Sita represents conditioned soul and golden deer maya - accepted to be separated from Ram in order to get it.
						Separated from Ram. Lord leaves but Vaishnavas are still with us but Vaishnava aparadh then they also leave.
						Conditioned soul without discrimination get cheated by Ravan - 10 heads or 10 senses.
						Garden Ashoka but cause of shoka - Even in peaceful when cry for Ram - Guru sent to that world to come into Lanka of this world.
						Amidst faults then good qualities are seen - like tulsi plant. Sits on tree and does 3 things.
						Ram Katha, Questions of Sita answered and gave rings. So, KK, Satisfying answers and sth more.
						@River into ocean - again water is evaporated but if fish in ocean then swim around and maintain your identity.
						All obstacles in the way of Hanuman. SP like hanuman jumped with BSS inspiration - all seductions rejected.
							obstacles rejected and engaged monkeys like us in west looking for SG and engaged in service.
				Hanuman tail set on fire - with all troubles thinking how to serve.
					with all opportunities, setbacks and fires in the life, choosing to serve Ram.
					he set lanka on fire - fault finding on back is Ravan nature - criticise bhakta behind back then devotion like lanka is lost.
					I can take you out but yes but what about other Sitas but do it for all.
					Sita teaches principle - Not concerned about my liberation but others like prahlad M.
				Found sita I - grammar is not right.
					Most important verb is found.
					Sita is who and I is last and few nano seconds will be wasted.
					embraces hanuman. what benediction - may I always get to jump for your service.
					Accept vibhishan if he has come to shelter - on recommendation of Hanuman. Vibhishan be the Lanka king.
						If Ravan comes to my shelter then him also king - but Vibhishan already then him to ayodhya.
						What about bharat, him Vaikuntha. Then you? I in Hanuman's heart.
				?Hanuman's name in personal diary.
				Our superhero is hanuman not superman, batman, spiderman.
					SP - you make me dance and his service has saved Sita like us conditioned soul of this world.
					Inconceivable mercy of Ram. Everywhere Ram went with invitation accept lanka cuz Sita was calling for him.
				Ramayan has been story of twists and turns - unpredictable change overnight - Ram king, Sita queen, Bharat suddenly culprit, Kaikeyi brainwashed,
					dashrath resigns overnight dies, deer jumps and game change play.
					If flip of planning in you then Ramayan revealing itself in reality.

				Qualities of material world and people may change but not God - Bhakta vatsala for a long time let me be asura vatsal.
				Lord appears to reclaim jivas BTG.
			Valmiki taking bath - cranes enjoying each other. Pierced and leaving body.
				Why destroyed peaceful lives of these cranes - cruel act may you suffer.
				From shoka came shloka in perfect meter - compose literature so I inspired said brahma.
				Great personality but composing on authority - submission is very important.
				Blessings of vaishnavas is inexhaustible and can take 1 to spiritual world.
			Presented to Lava and Kusha - who went distributing
				best way to understand is hearer and speaker - both advance and experience satisfaction.
				Higher taste required to overcome lower taste of sense gratification.
				Rupa G - Need nectar of KK to alleviate the problems for age of kali.
				MOP and MOI so concentration on KK is difficult - Newspaper 2 reading simultaneously and derive taste.
				KK - 7 said all tensions gone so I sleep peacefully.
				SP - Krishna book on janmashtami night and chapters after chapters. Kurukshetra in people - let's end and loudest hari bol.
				Salt-mine you enter you will end up touching salt so miseries in material world are obvious.

				This track of land is not material world. Auspicious flowers. Sophisticated weapons.
				1 frustration that no son - that's the nature of world - n good things and 1 bad thing brings problem.
				harsh + Shoka is the nature of world.
				But he took shelter of great souls - what we do is important - shelter of SG, psychiatrist.
				Highest suicide rate among psychiatrist - what's this suicide and they also end up doing.
				Dasharath had roti kapda makaan so next problems show up.
				Akaama sarva kaamo va - take shelter of Krishna or great souls - charity also.
					Ganesh drinking milk - mood in feeding milk was giving you milk and will get rabdi from you later.
						Get down you don't trust Krishna eats ed and ppl take - why not Krishna.
					St shelter of easy liquidity. Demigods, astrologers but Krishna demands ananya bhakti.
			Yajna
				Kaushalya 1/2 and Sumitra 1/4 and 1/8 to Kaikeyi and 1/8 again to Sumitra.
				Demigods taking birth ready to serve Lord.
					Lord moving with monkeys - no distinguished personality likes to be associated with them.
						Uddhava astonished by nature of God - no shame in accepting services from monkeys.
						Lord accepts service from anyone with love and shelter.
					Mayavadis cut off Lord with energies. Some say SP without associates.
						Krishna means Krishna along with his associates or devotees or paraphernalia.
						can't say Ram but without monkeys.
					Demigods created atmosphere for lord to appear.
				Children Ram, Laxman and Shatrughna, Bharat born.
					Purification - birth by sanskar, money by charity, food by offering, mind by satisfaction, soul by KC.
					Lord also performs sanskars for us to follow in footsteps.
			Vishvamitra Muni
				Dashrath asks how is self enquiry going on - how is your KC going on.
				Your presence like rain after long drought, receiving child after long time, etc - what can I do to you.
				Many disturbances from asuras. Those who interrupt sankirtan yajna are asuras or rakshasas.
				Brahmin doesn't retaliate but ask for help from kshatriya.
				Heart crushed to give Ram for 10 days - can't live without him for a moment.
				Ravan does not appear but sends associate - I will come and fight so don't take him.
				Angry - Such is not expected from dynasty - he was kshatriya b4 and will get weapons and arts from him.
				Ayodhya to ashram. Taataka demon killed. Marich could be killed but for service for future not killed.
			Ahalya regains her form by touch of Lord.
				SPOG divine feet in our lives - our lives get transformed.
				Ram to Mithila Janaka.
		</BaalKanda>
		<AyodhyaKanda>
		L2 - Ayodhya Kand
			Shiva's bow
				Janak M asks Vishvamitra M - history of bow of Lord shiva to be witnessed.
				Shiva sacrifice - daksha opposed so used the bow - extremely afraid and Shiva to demigods to forefathers to Janak.
				So heavy that 500 men lift it - levelling ground and effulgent baby girl from earth came out with divine qualities.
					she lift effortlessly so condition to marry her but no1 ever successful.
					will you allow Ram to take a look. Sure.
					brought to arena with 500 men - e1 waiting to see what will happen.
					Ram stringing it and broke in the process.
				Sita is eternal consort of Ram - 9 years of age for Sita.
					huge dowry from Janak.
				Parshuram another incarnation meets - very rare they do - lift the vishnu's bow and he did.
				Lakshman and bharat also had been married.
			Coronation planned - Future events
				Pastimes for us to give us hope. If he can tolerate why should not we - I can't change the nature of the world.
				change the situation of battlefield Arjuna could have said but no, nature of the world.
				Dashrath had promised bharat's father once that he would be installed as king and didn't want to honor that.
				bad omens so impediments so perform ceremony tomorrow.
				Quality of devotee wrt to SPOG will be showcased in future.
				1 person extremely angry - Manthara - demigoddess from heavens for the purpose.
				Demigods to ensure that Ram should not forget asuras killing purpose - Ram should be forced to kill Ravan.
				Envy and rage to see festivities.
				So separatist vision just like Dhritarashtra (maam and pandavas) at the beginning of BG.
				Temple - mine and their same attitude. Different from supreme interest.
				ISKCON like dharmakshetra but can become yudhakshetra if interests are different.
			Manthara poisons Kaikeyi
				How in ignorance; don't know the events - Ram be king - yes and gave jewels to those who brought the news.
				She has feelings of devotion and love.
				If he becomes king then not bharat and you relegated to maidservant.
				First seed of suspicion, doubt and intrigue put inside the mind - so association impacts.
				Opening mind - 1 of 6 exchanges is association.
				Avoid mayavadis - how to identify mayavadis in India - scratch any Indian hindu and mayavadi inside.
				Amritsar - eth is 1 - then thread of blanket is same as blanket so take the thread for the night.
				Manthara's criticism made kaikeyi lose faith - thinking of possibilities she felt insecure.
				Modern day manthara - Internet misguidance. 7 has trouble of writing - no smoke without fire so there must be something.
				Somewhere solmen island - indigenous people technique abuses for trees and over 6 years tilts and falls on ground.
				blaspheme and criticise the morale drops. So much affection from Ram but affected thru the sound vibration.
				what to do - now you are talking - you remember benedictions - ask 2 boons now. Danger if Ram is around so send him to forest.
				She felt ecstatic cuz contaminated by association - that's the impact.
				Raghunath Bhatta G - never tolerate criticism - walks out - try his best to serve Krishna is all I know.
					Only Krishna can judge.
				Manthara you are beautiful lady - not sinful, best of hunchback women. Walking stooped like lotus under wind.
					 will decorate your hunch and will massage - discrimination is lost.
					Kamat krodhobhi jayate.
				Among all in Ayodhya only she is my well wisher.
			Dashrath confronted
				shrivelled and clothes torn - attached to wrong person and motives causes misfortune.
				let only 1st one be fulfilled - you had promised you can't go back on words that's dynasty.
				hard hearted cruel woman who was so happy devotee b4.
				Kaushalya came to know about this first.
				Ram thinking something about proceedings.
				Dashrath calls but sth wrong felt - Dashrath could not speak so fell unconscious
				Kaikeyi said he doesn't have strength to speak so I will - vow that you will follow his instruction then I will say.
				2 desires told - alright from father but even from you it's fine - I will go to forest with your blessings.
				maryada purushottam eg. Children in India criticised be like Ram and they say you be like dashrath.
				Kaushalya just told by Ram as matter of fact and leaving.
				Lakshman filled with rage - he is just acting outta lust. I will corronate you and if Dashrath opposes I will kill him also.
				Lakshman don't be angry - please gimme blessings - your tears are discouraging me from obeying my father. Plz encourage me.
				Sita told - you can't live in forest. Her feet earlier became red touching lotus so soft. roots, fruits and herbs won't suit you.
				I will perish in separation - you not here then hell and being with you even forest is heaven.
				Lakshman stay here for service - Shatrughna can do that so let me come.
			Leaving Ayodhya
				Ram Lakshman Sita prepared to go to forest and money charity given - Trijata
					stick and all cows that it goes over are yours.
					Dashrath said let soldiers, merchants and treasures come with you - she will have doubt in my integrity.
					You can't take resources without permission of Bharat said kaikeyi - I will wear tree bark - she shamelessly brought from him to wear which he did.
				Sita could not and it slipped so wear above sari said Ram.
				People - let us leave with you, forest will be ayodhya and vv. Ram appreciated their devotion but didn't allow.
				Many old sages slowly walking while he was going - he walked along with them.
				King of Nishadas Guha king - but devotee - stay here and be the king of nishads.
					delicious dishes brought - only fruits and roots and delicious dishes given to horses.
					I want to cross the river - I have a request to wash lotus feet. Why?
					Ahalya converted to lady and I can't allow that to boat so removing dust.
				Bharadwaj Rishi greeted - suggested somewhere far so that Kaikeyi also assured that vanvas going on.
					100 miles you find chitrakoot - so scenic that happy with wife - like spiritual world non-different - near Satna in MP.
					without tour guide you heart will be enchanted.
					Janaki kund - Sita's bath place, mountain for parikrima, Narsimha murti carved by Ram. 13 years spent there so very powerful.
					kinda like vraj lila.
				Bharat M comes back to Ayodhya on message - interesting response and meeting chitrakoot.
					it was not sentimental meeting but more to it.
					Not 2 bros like Ambani asked to stay together like former for share prices.
					Nasik Dandakaranya forest visit in future - Sita's kidnapping place.
					Shurpanakha and abducted any peaceful place - chitrakoot was last peaceful place and from here action starts and many like that.
					How can hanuman jump the ocean - superman jumping so why not - that's where ideas come from.

		L3 - Aranya Kanda (Beginning)
			Kali yuga qualities diminish - Naimisharanya most auspicious place.
				Only yajna is hearing and chanting as given by LCM - SB, Hari katha and chant HN.
				sitting in posture in kali yuga is impossible in current age.
				small child can't even ball on the pitch so big and boundary so big that can't see - ball replaced plastic.
				things simplified so that they think they are doing it - so is recipe for kali people.
				Just be in right association and perfect will come - massage needed then stay in the train.
				Just stay near the gate and needful will happen.
				1 gets forcibly dragged to perfection that's the power of devs.
			Bharat returns
				Bharat was away to Kaikeya - present day Russia.
				message sent to come back to Ayodhya.
				Enters the city and e1 grief-stuck.
				Reaches and realizes that Dashrath is gone. Stay equipoise in happiness and distress says Kaikeyi.
					Bro Ram Lakshman Sita exiled and left body in separation calling their names.
					Exiled on sin like Brahmin killing - no, you don't know what all happened and told.
					He screams at mother - wicked lady, you personify kali. I will also go to forest. So wicked how you think I will accept.
					I will not consider myself as your son from today.
					Meets Kaushalya - explains that your plans will be met. Extreme sad that don't speak like this - never consulted and don't misunderstand me.
					1 minister brought manthara - shatrughna starts beating her - Bharat intervenes don't behave with woman like this.
				Mood of Bharat to bring back Ram with entourage - this is essence of Vaishnavism - eternally part and parcel of Krishna.
					Mayavadis think that we can become God. Bharat M's behavior is punch on that philosophy.
					Atheist - God not exists, retired after creation, God exists and I will kill him, I am God.
					99.9% spiritualists tinged with mayavad.
					Growth opportunity we look for - trainee for 30 years - stagnant not growth - Krishna says eternal servant.
					Education system with show of humility but desire to be the master underneath.
					Here Bharat given the lordship but rejected.
					1 devotee to parents wrote letter - Signed your servant - that's what you have become - sorry, it's servant of the servant.
					No desire for Post, position, prestige.
					SP - Mayavadi asked SP no mention of Krishna and dhyan means bhakti yoga. Just pointing out no Krishna but you mention.
						why tolerating SP so much - generally SP would punch.
						This man chanting name of Krishna for 1 hour he chanted HK so next time he will listen.
						1 mayavadi visited temple and said with confidence you are worshipping me very nicely ed.
			Bharat Starts
				Guha asks Bharat why so many soldiers what are you intentions - do you know about his whereabouts; you think I can enjoy without Ram.
					just testing - go to bharadwaj Ashram and he will guide further.
					Huge army - what are your intentions - just wanna serve Lord Ram. I knew thru mystic yoga but was testing.
					Whole army gives best arrangements for the night by his mystic power - power of the past.
				Ram hears sound and Lakshman on the tree to see - huge army approaching.
					I see flag of Bharat - he is coming to kill us - gimme arrow and I will kill him immediately.
					You wanna be king you can do that - I am convinced that he is coming to meet me.
					Don't act hastily to destroy relationship - don't jump to conclusions without clarity.
				Bharat comes and says after demise of Dashrath, eldest takes over the kingdom - grief.
					requests to come back. Args to come back and counter args to not come back.
					alternate ideas - Jabali Rishi - why bona fide ways didn't work - body is made of chemicals and life is temporary
						eth will finish to dust. Enjoy the kingdom and then eth finishes to dust.
						Not new chemical theories. Very old.
					SP - Archaeologist - what you do - study primitive people - I am devotee and study advanced people.
						Theories existed in past - cuz guilt gone when God is removed.
						Jagannath Puri - Pandas ask gotra - Dyutakarma Pr - Darwin's followers should say monkey gotra.
					Give them chance to serve you - e1 wants you back - will be back after 14 years.
				Seeing he won't come back - place your feet in sandals and they will remain on the throne.
					You will continue ruling for next 14 years and I will simply be humble servant.
					instructions from sages to do needful.
					No royalty - stay in Nandigram outside and drink simple soup and sleep under the ground.
					All facilities to enjoy but choosing to serve and surrender to the will of the lord.
					Ram wear and takes feet away - puts sandals on the head and leaves.
					Service attitude over the years in HK goes on increasing.
					SP - Jayananda Pr - Garbage cleaner and so blissful thus preaching.
						go near apple tree and tree offered to Picture of Krishna - e1 picks apples from trees will take prasadam and be devotee.
						never bought new clothes - at least for sake of movement wear new clothes.
						In a market - for myself I won't pay, so won't pay for T-shirt for my own SG.
						Such sincere face judge asked police why don't you pay.
						Cancer and admitted - posh room - came near bed and SP picture with garland - and where is patient - lying on ground near sink.
						Opulence from SM and simple life for me he said.
					Devs here make arrangements for Lord to wear
						you won't see devs in temple with opulence for themselves.
					SP - 1976 celebrating 10 years of ISKCON inception - cake cutting.
						We offer to Krishna and he gives back - servant enjoys so much.
						Servants enjoying as much as master - no, servant enjoys more than master. He takes little and servant has it all.
					SP observed banana dance - banana smoke then LSD feeling. SP laughed I never knew this use of banana and did kirtan.
						offer from hippies - 1 banana for jagannath and said peels back. Never knew I had to solve such scenarios.
						Mood of offering to Krishna is good so let's accept it. Money, resource, time, life force for Krishna.
				Mood Bharat vs Ravan - Serving Ram's enjoyment vs snatch Sita away for his own enjoyment.
		</AranyaKandaBegins>
		<AranyaKandaLatter>
		L4 - More Aranya + Kishkindha
			Bharat with all his intel tries his best to convince Lord Ram. Not successful so brings sandals.
			Killing viradha.
			Sitikshana ashram they stay - Sita devi says wanted to say this for long time - sword in hand.
				Indra to Brahmin I have come to hunt - hold the sword - uses for tree, then animal, then human.
				You may end up killing cuz sword in hand. Protect kingdom vs protecting the sages in the forest.
				Law of association - association with even objects in the world they have power to influence us.
				Even electronic gadgets create influence on us.
			Agastya rishi - who guides them to panchavati - stayed at parna kutir - made of leaves.
			Shurpanakha appears in Janasthan
				lust so forgot to change her form. Who is this ugly lady.
				Ram in sarcasm said that arrangement of Lord - my wife already here and co-wife you will become.
				Lakshman be approached with strong arms. Big difference between Ram and me - I am das so you become dasi.
				You wanna be dasi? No to Ram. back and forth ping pong. That happens when lusty.
				Angry so tried to choke Sita and pastime finished with cutting off the nose - fell in nashik from other side of godavari.
				14K rakshasa army headed by khara and dushan invoked by her and killed by bros.
					akampan escaped and told Ravan. Not happy with news then Ravan used to kill so gimme assurance to not kill.
					Humans but very powerful - don't go to kill them alone. He is extremely attached to Sita so kidnap her.
			Ravan meets Marich
				Very urgent mission. Killed my 14K - insult to rakshasa race.
				Demons nature is SPOG as human - they appear to be ordinary humans but are tremendously powerful.
					without being favored by devotee, one does not get to understand lord.
					Bilvamangal thakur - Huge Varha dev Body - 1 skin pore of his body so big that all oceans in earth could fit in there.
						But he can be bathed in 1 drop of water. That's inconceivable nature.
					SP - I have presented so many books for you to understand that he is inconceivable and we can't understand him.
					Virat rupa deity - all clothes, all food will be consumed.
				Marich - who advised to kidnap Sita - whoever did this wants to see your death ASAP.
					his arms like ocean where enemies just die.
					1st class advise but vinash kale viparit buddhi. You already have millions of queens.
					In youth thinks that lust influence so let me come in contact with another person in lust and satisfy each other.
					lust converts to anger and so forth. Eth as opportunity to fulfill lust vs world to serve Krishna.
					SP - why Krishna created world - for enjoyment...not yours but Krishna's.
					Ravan mentality keeps propping so take dev association.
					SP - Factory anxiety. Give it to us and you be peaceful. Give us the address - I know your address; gave reluctantly.
					At this stage he thinks he can't be happy without Sita. Ravan in constant anxiety since infatuated with Sita.
					But still, Ravan buys the advise of Marich and comes back.
				Shurpanakha - no justice in your kingdom. Look at treatment done to me.
					She details Sita devi - most beautiful and your life is useless until you get her.
					This obsessed Ravan being agitated by Shurpanakha and revisits Marich.
					Plan worked. Why again asks marich - this time plan and instruction not advise
					If I follow then killed by Ram, If I don't, then by Ravan. Better get killed by Ram (?bad move)
			Sita Abduction
				Deer shows up and hides - Ram observes and kills still.
				No power can touch Ram - instructed to not go. I know your inner motive - you wanted to enjoy me - thunderbolt on heart.
				Marich's call felt like Ram but was demon - st mind cheat us in the name of Paramatma - maybe it's Lord's desire.
				So, don't disobey gurus (siksha or diksha, etc) saying that it's lord's wish - be submissive to help discriminate.
				SP - plz bless to be humble - first be humble.
				Ravan entered. Approached Sita Devi - asked many questions - who are you asking beauty - are you damsel from heaven.
				She bewildered sage should not speak like that.
				Gimme alms - advantage to kidnap her.
				You like jackal and playing with lioness without knowing consequences. Wipe eyes with needle. stop fire with cloth.
				Drinking poison like foolish.
				You like crow and he is garuda. You like muddy puddle and he like ocean. He like nectar, you poison. He sandalwood and you wood.
				You like fly wants to eat ghee - you will just drown in the ghee.
				Valmiki Ramayan has no mention of Lakshman rekha but is there in other version.
					when we cross the maryada boundary then we are not safe.
				Sita represents Bhakti and Ravan as swindler - saffron wearing but stealing the bhakti away.
					Hanuman's search for Sita is like sadhaka seeking bhakti
					Jail lecture can't run away - Why Ramo although Ram - Our person also scholar so clapped.
						Eat this aamo will you reject this.
						In sambodhan st called like this.
					Many movies on Bhagat singh we have it on Sundays congregation - how? bhagats come and they sing.
						word jugglery - upadharmis. Chhal is another swindler. King of manipur met BSS said tea from BG - sarvasya chayam (7 told him so).
					Bhakti in heart is precious; safeguard it else Ravan like people come and steal it.
					Pray from Lord Ram that we may sincerely chant HN for rest of our lives.

		L5 - Kishkindha, Yuddha and Uttar
			Jatayu - eagle or vulture - eager and inspired to serve seeing Sita abducted.
				Vidura meets Uddhava - remembering Krishna tears filled eyes of Uddhava. Same devotion and enthu when he was young.
					Walt Disney - medicine to overcome death. 10M dollars for research - some system to put on machine and bring him back.
					Another 10M with propaganda to not bring him to life.
					Soul is eternal so perfrom activities on the platform of soul. On body level fatigues but none on soul platform.
					No retirement in bhakti - inspired to do more. Bhakti not that no more latter like other activities ?in MOI - Bhakti for more bhakti.
					Jatayu was so old that he had every excuse to not act but sprang into Action.
					Physical incapability but could not stop him - that's bhakti.
				Different body parts were cut by Ravan.
				She threw jewels on the ground and this was observed by apes.
				Many services we may feel incapable - others meet our false ego - our surrender and service is tested st.
					Ravan should have fought me 100 years back then I would have helped - my best wishes for Sita, so obvious, I will pray for you, will convey message to Ram.
					Conditions are not right. Mgmt ain't right - let me stay here in lethargy.
					Ravan too powerful for me - let me not even try - here's a chance of service - whatever results I must try - need of the hour.
					Work is worship is what they think - factory is temple - siren is shankh and crude oil is charanamrita.
					Other times paralysis in analysis - Centipede dancing nicely - you dance very nicely how you do it - stopped dancing and thinking but could not walk - paralysis in analysis.
					Whole time in consequences of action thus no action taken - Jatayu didn't fall for this.
					Service - good in the eyes of others and not those - we have preferences.
					Ram came and no idea - touched by Jatayu - Sita kidnapped doesn't pain me as much as Jatayu sacrificing his life.
					Jatayu has gone BTG cuz of sacrifice. Who won is the question.
				Arjuna won for Krishna and BTG. Here in Jatayu, lost but BTG. From material perspective defeated cuz Ravan proved to be more powerful.
					We try in material world and st fail in our mission - not material organization but bhakti can still win.
					Internal moods and motivations matter. Mundane person thinks Arjuna role model and Jatayu blew it but he was successful - need maturity.
					Material propaganda is so high that forget Jatayu. Battlefield I be victorious. What's best from Krishna's perspective is important.
					SP lost - Business set on fire. Tested again - giving eth. Seiko watch. Credit cards. Never losing bhakti.
					SP in africa - not eating - how can I eat when they steal cement bags in mumbai. I am not a man to be disappointed.
				Try level best then that's what matters.
					SP - Pamphlets distributed but no1 came - SP - didn't you see there were demigods. BSS used to spread the mat full - demigods may come.
					SP - Vrindavan temple - Donate temple promise - Mr Sarve - not honoring his charity. Described king mriga. Became lizard. Satsvarupa Pr had taken SP's clothes - thought he won't use so shivering.
						chit system and then mood of shops in front - SP wrote the letter.
					SP - Gurudas Pr in Vrindavan only chanting - Gurudas Pr said about Krishna's lila he wondered.
						his words were cement - what's esoteric about it - we need cement bags to finish fast.
					SP - What 6th verse of MA mean - he said distribute books - assist acaryas.
				Arjuna fought level best and abhimanyu died.
					Arjuna crying. Krishna crying why you crying - just spoke BG to you and see you crying so I cry.
				Vulture last rites - they not allowed in same queue as others.
					Nandigram to meet bharat b4 Bharat b4 Ayodhya.
					Hanuman warned Sophisticated place can't do monkey business.
					Ram asked hanuman to share the plate - can't eat with master - cut in banana leaf - paramatma and atma are different.

				Jambavan old now - 21 times could but now only 90. Angad - 100 I can but no strength to return.
				Leader should not go across the ocean. Jambavan sees at hanuman and says he can do it.
				All the fogotten power reminded.
				Mount mahindra will be good launching pad - expands and huge, gigantic - e1 sees hanuman size and gets bewildered even sages.
			Hanuman's mission to find Sita - we are on hanuman mission to find bhakti.
				we also gotta jump 100 yojans to get to find our bhakti.
				sadhana service sadachar - so much to do to get there.
			Sadhana Lesson Mainak under ocean - had relation with hanuman's father vayu
				We get opportunities to take rest and get complacent in sadhana - allure to relax our efforts in KC.
				Since the goal is very far and real taste in bhakti is not there yet so relaxation is possible.
				SP - when calamity on devotee, his faith dwindles and becomes complacent.
					SP - proof of good chanting is after 16 rounds you ask why only 16 why not more. We think why not less.
				Any service with time you can do with eyes closed eventually but chanting you can't do - you think so and next moment you dose.
				Life is a mission not intermission.
				Material life like onion - every peel brings tears.
				Why Krishna doing this to me - is he not keeping track of my 16 rounds.
				Problems and rather than taking shelter of Krishna, we think of problem or parallel processing.
				Your JD is to worry - when do I get my first cheque - that's your first worry.
				Japa of SP - and you hear - Sit properly. Posture, Pronunciation and pace for good chanting.
				SP - sleep too much then lazy else crazy.
				St old conditionings cause losing faith.
				Starts with little complacency which grows with time.
				SP - 1 dev too much into yoga that forgot HK chanting - All of your problems cuz of rasayans not proper
					brake not working - which rasayan you would use and SP peacefully chanting - it's back - nothing can protect us from BODD.
				Jananivas Pr sits in Bengali class - sound vibration is purifying.
				Mind wants to give reasons to not do bhakti - bhakti is good but not so much.
			Service Lesson - Surasa - comes with mouth wide open - brahma's benediction to pass thru my mouth - eat e1 -
				Allow me to go and get back then you can eat me.
				10 yojans - 20, 30, 50. 100 - Hanuman became very tiny and entered your mouth.
				I fulfilled your condition - You are very intel monkey.
				False pride in doing one's service - who is better competition
				Brahmin very particular at gayatri and kali woke him up. You are same or changed
					You would have felt if you missed - humble and great advancement so made you do it to stay proud.
				Competition and conflict - law of gravity in spiritual circles - More you go up, great chances of fall. Lighter, Krishna will lift.
				Humility - eager to serve others or be served, glorify Krishna or myself, thinking of Krishna or myself.
					When false pride comes it's already fallen; only detail comes later.
					We start from dasanudas to das to...mahaprabhu.
				Hare tortoise story extended.
					Individual race.
					Hare pride.
					Different route - even river this time - tortoise won.
					Friends now - reached destination fastest on the toughest route - switched the role and enjoyed experience.
					Not competing against each other but challenges together.
				Difference of opinion with another devotee - it proves mayavad is bogus said SP.
				KC is not black or white - 1 is right does not mean other is wrong.
				SP - 1 dev said Krishna is black and Balaram is white. Yamuna mataji said no Krishna enjoys Radha.
					He is right. She is right but both contradictory how can both be right - yes you are right. Who is right - you decide.
					Eth can't be understood by logic and reasoning.
				Took humble position and conflict was resolved.
				Other religions to get free of sins but SP gave us freedom from false pride
				Rupa G to Jiva - I already sign - you mentality not fit for vrindavan.
				LCM defeated prakashanand sarasvati thru his humility not scholarship.
				LCM's childhood friend - book on logic and grammar or I also written but who will read mine now - forget my book threw in ganges.
			Dealings and Relationship - Sindhika - grabs Hanuman's shadow - could not move thru mystic power.
				straight into mouth, heart and pierced her.
				dealings and relationships are we critical or appreciative.
				Nature of envy - you see dark and pull down the person.
				Original envy is why Krishna is god. Original desire is why not I god.
				God as oridinary and I as special is mayavad.
				SP - My book. Plz tell. Many notes. Now swami will tell about my book. Yes, this book is bogus don't read this mayavad.
					Bewildered cuz big program for his book launch. Sorry I can't compromise.
				We have to struggle and destory it in the heart.
				Not vedantists but be-dant-ist - vaishnavas have removed this poisonous teeth.
				So many swamis think they are god what you think - they are bogus - sth more - yes one more that they are rascals.
				Any good quality in others we don't like - origin is that against Krishna.
				Story - Only 1 hand judo teacher only 1 trick - continuous practice you mastered lethal trick - only 1 defense hold left hand you didn't have one so won the tournament.
					Rather than what you don't have - maximize what you have.
				Krishna - you didn't give me that which you gave him or her - appreciate what we have and others - not critical or criticize.
				Free from burden of getting appreciation.
				SP - Shyamsundar Pr - 1 dev had to go jail for previous offense - fearful of confronting SP cuz putting bad name.
					gotta go to jail - Krishna was born in jail. Selling drugs b4 - I had pharmacy so drugs. Chant HK there.
					SP gave feedback right way for different feeling.
				Painting - Radha's hand with garland away from Krishna - oh another boyfriend she observed - no she liked your painting so offering garland to you.
				You neglect me I will not forgive. You encourage me I will never forget you.
				SP - This leader not chanting HK 16 rounds. Arjuna didn't chant on battlefield. I never thought this way - concentrate on yourself don't look at him.
					Thanks for telling me I didn't know.
				Many marriages - I am not encouraged or appreciated enough.
				If you wanna dig gold - dig thru tons of dirt to get there.
				Put pressure on carbon and it becomes diamond.
				With binaculars we can see far off clearly. ISKCON is the one for Krishna.
				12 mahajans - 1 said SP you are 13th and SP said you are 14th.
				Hanuman reached lanka - so grand and beautiful.
			Preaching - Took form of cat searching for Sita. Lankini stops.
				no1 enters - no1 can enter without permission so leave - she was about to punch hanuman - hanuman slaps timely and she fell apart.
				The day monkey slaps you brahma said the destruction of ravan starts.
				Spreading mission of Lord Ram in areas just like lanka where influence of demoniac influences prevail. Rakshasas are strong.
				Opposition and stopped by lankini like people. What's you business here - this destroys our enthu.
				Hanuman just became fearless when faced with opposition.
				Once preaching and child asked mother - who is he - she said bhoot. The child later will think bhoot and temples bhoot bangla.
				SP - here MIT where is almighty - There is opposition.
					SP why this mud on your head - why this tie on neck - never thought about it - sit down and think about it.
					questions be relevant not this non-sense questions like this - on dress and all.
				Indian asked SP - why preaching in west - why you came here? - I for higher prospects.
					Tell them gita they say we already know gita. We can teach you some gita.
					e1 is guru there.
				SP - controversial question - who is greater - MK Gandhi or me - he drove them out and I engage them in my service. I don't pay him anything.
					no business man can understand this.
				1 joined temple - parents sent his other son and he also joined.
					why kept both my sons - from streets and here so gentleman so you should gimme donation.
					I already donated my sons - SP said thank you very much.
			Hanuman solved all these obstacles with right attitude - all the demons representations - service attitude, fearless preaching, etc.
				next we explore hanuman's childhood pastimes and what follows his search for Sita Devi.
		L3 - Lanka Visit
			Jambavan tells story how he forgot power - due to offense heavenly damsel born as anjana.
				Vayudev in charge of wind enchanted to see her - gonna beget son thru you.
				gave birth to stout looking monkey called hanuman.
				saw sun and thought to be fruit and leaped to eat it.
				E1 scared what will happen when later he grows up.
				sun didn't disturb and arranged chariot - rahu interrupted.
				indra's airavat next target. Hanu maan - vayu resentment.
				Blessings - effulgence, no weapons, no curse effect, etc.
				Even more powerful now - disrupt sacrifices and pull beards, jump on their backs, etc.
				Kesari told not the misbehave but no change - e1 came together to resolve that make him forget his power.
			On reaching lanka, becomes a small cat and looks for Sita Devi.
				Unable to find Sita anywhere - beautiful palace must be Ravan's.
				Intoxicated women partially dressed enjoying with person must be Ravan - his thought if only he engaged in KC.
				Saw beautiful lady besides Ravan - could be Sita but no - how can she enjoy independent of Ram.
				I am seeing women and observing closely - is that correct for brahmacari like me.
				inapt - deeply analysing his motives. Search for horses, then gotta look in stable.
				My motive is clear - not agitated and bewildered cuz specific guided mission.
				St services for lord which involve interactions with material energy.
					Then one can remain protected.
				SP - 1 person turning away from money photo - take my photo other way round cuz engaged in Krishna's service.
				Kurma Brahmin wanted to leave - LCM said no don't do it. Sthane sthita.
			Tried homes, forests, etc - Depression.
				Objective not achieved then depression comes. Frustration when setbacks.
				overcome by doubts - Maybe Sita's no longer alive.
				Lots of time analysing maybe what all could have gone wrong - jumped from vimaan, suicide, Ravan cut her, etc.
				What has happened, why it must have happended and What will happen.
				Ram will definitely leave his body on leaving body, lakshman will leave. 2 bros also - Ayodhya people will.
				Sugriva thinking that he could not - suicide and also leaders. So why return let me do it now only.
				FEAR - False evidence appearing real. Dark room where negatives develop.
				Once Vanars decided to do ekadashi - but won't have energy to jump the tree, pluck the fruit, keep fruit close, chew it, let us eat only - I have eaten.
					How mind works.
				Full of doubts then only enthu, patience - nishcayat dhairyat.
				determination enthu for all bliss in 1 sanskrit bliss.
			I will find with effort - Krishna helped - saw a tree - yogakshem vahamyaham, ye yatha maam.
				Effulgent Lady must be Sita - Fire covered by smoke, vedic text misinterpreted, hope shattered, intellect misused.
				Ravan there to entice Sita - I have tried all efforts please agree.
				Cupid's arrow of Lust - Harshanam (joy), smaranam (remembrance), rocanam (demanding), karshanam (pain), roshanam (no appetite and weakness), maranam (die).
				SP - 1 beautiful lady passed by and 1 dev kept looking and realized his mistake and saw at SP; SP looking at him.
					when shameful. SP said beautiful wasn't she - didn't know what to say - If worldly beauty is so charming how beautiful Krishna must be.
				She puts grass in front of Ravan with smirk. Many interpretations by different sampradaya.
				She tried all sam daam danda bhed with Ravan.
					protect me like other wives (saam) else ppl rejoice on your death (Bhed)
					Ram will give you jeevan daan (daam) and gifts else he will destroy you (dama)
				Ravan angry on this - I am tolerating you and you chastise - if she doesn't agree chop her up and I will have her for my lunch.
				Sita planning to use braid for suicide - Hanuman thought must gotta come outta incognito.
				She screams and ladies wake up and then soldiers and then e1 will know - Must convey s.t Ram and Sita's interests are protected.
				SP - particular at presenting per TPC. In english and distribution on streets no1 knew.
					SP - Your distributors are ew book book book ew; they are bookworms - better than stool worm.
			Ravan like contaminated mind; Sita like Jiva and teacher has come for message. Qualities of Jiva to qualify.
				Guru gives message when disciple is bona fide.
				Ramanujacarya says qualities that teacher sees and to be redeemed
				ekagra (concentrated) - allurements could not distract her - could not be chief queen but resists maya.
					1 dev in Vrindavan would chant only 2 lines of SA4 - next 2 lines too difficult - LCM has given highest standard.
					SP - Brajvasis - even if given 1 crore won't give up Krishna's service all claps including students; you are not yet tested but confident.
				adhyaya vasaya - faith in power and mercy of lord - I will chop and devour you and Ram is anyways gonna be killed.
					faith that avashya rakshibe Krishna - You are master and I am your dog says BVT protect me.
				Aadar - reverence for seniors, instructors, guru - Hanumanji appeared as monkey.
					could have felt a normal monkey and Ram geet that this is messenger of Lord Ram and no disqualification
					not just forest animal but Lord's representative.
					SP - BSS told SP to distribute books and preachi in english
					Hayagriva typed few pages - anymore typing work - full of SB purports in trunk - many lifetimes of work.
				Anusuya - lack of envy
					complete trust in words of instructor - responses to KK - reject, doubt the intent, misinterpret, 4th one - ?accept.
					bull goes around and water comes out - 1 machine in India.
						bell so that I know he is working - what if he keep shaking head - he is not logician like you.
					SP - why chanting HK nw in Upanishads - what you think upanishads say - continued for 10 mins - finished - then demolished his args for 20 mins.
						after st questioner said can we have kirtan.
				Qualified then KK and 2nd task after nourishment is protection.
					Sita gave ring for id.
					Ravan and his men - 2nd part starts.
					How to destroy evil propensities in mind - mind holds soul captive in current state.
			Asuras encountered
				Forest destroyed.
				Prahasta - defeat
				Jambamali - do you wanna get killed - mission of Ram so no1 can kill me.
					Even indra on flag post and 9 grahas do cooking in kitchen.
					release Sita devi - let me finish - 80K soldiers and stone pelting on them.
					arrows and held his arrows and threw back.
					mantras to increase his size and hanuman coming till his ankles.
					Closed to be even more big and then saw 2 big circles.
					Those are my knees said Hanuman that was my capacity - any soldier to help - no1 responded
					I kept Ravan's sth on them and they died peaceful - that's maya - what are you doing.
					Chant name of Lord ram - with Index finger on his naval threw on ground.
				Indrajeet - garuda pasha and personalities - so bound.
					how monkey could do it - give sitting place for messenger.
					No animals - sit on trees - so I have to become less than animal to sit here.
					kill him. Ok I will make my own place and twisted tail with height greater than Ravan - now we can talk.
					So angry - kill him - no you can't kill a doot - monkeys love their tail put it on fire.
					Another part of his mission was done - seeing fortification and formations for defense, etc.
				Tail set on fire.
					Few verses on power of anger. Bona fide engagement of anger eg but he says.
					Still dangerous he says - lanka set on fire what if ashoka vatika goes on fire.
					Give up anger like snake gives up his skin
					Gang to visit temple and collect Lord's mercy for chappals and thieves photo we have taken.
					Group of devs waiting for them - give them mahaprasad - why was I not called 7 said.
					comes back to Sita Devi - you are best of vanars - only vayu and garuda could cross this ocean
					How will others do - idea of profit adoration and distinction - imagine getting it from Sita Devi and that too seems true.
					He said it's not true - e1 in sugriva's army is either equal to me to better than me. No false humility.
					I can prove this - messenger is a postman - warrior or generals are not sent as messenger - imagine havoc they can create.
					Lord Ram - 1 crore mahaoagh monkeys he was managing - anyone claims to be god give them 3 monkeys to manage.
		L4 - After returning from Lanka.
			Hanumanji position as acarya.
				Krishna has relationship with jiva - leaves and suffering for both jiva and more so for ishwar.
				What efforts Krishna makes to reclaim jiva in the world.
				Shri Sampradaya writes a lots; other sampradayas also write on Ramayan.
				Sita not equated to jiva but analogy is given.
				SP writes Devaki represents bhakti - VCT present these insights. not literally.
				Ravan holds soul captive - 10 heads represent karma and jnana indriyas.
				Divine messenger is sent to reclaim the souls - the messenger is very beautiful in the eyes of the Lord so sundar kand.
				Soul foolishly thinks that ocean and forts are impregnable - only hanuman like acaryas can relieve the soul.
				Such preachers are very dear to me says Krishna
				Lankini is goddess of lanka or represents power of lanka - represents false ego - surrendered to Ravan.
				Ego is there => can't make further progress.
				Lankini stopped onwards journey of Hanuman but got a slap - ego prevents guru from making influence and guru fights back.
				preceptor thus has important duty so gotta bombard jiva's ego.
				All pleasures surrounding Ravan. Should not see undressed women - apt under Krishna's guidance.
				Even helper may get influenced by the contaminated mind (?ecosystem) - so need powerful KC.
				Entered lanka but didn't let lanka enter him - preach as per one's capacity.
				Purity is the force SP says.
			Hanuman was best messenger against Ravan - cuz Hanuman had conquered lust.
				how had he mastered lust - by love for Lord Ram. He stayed uncontaminated in the culture of Lust.
				Effect of preaching as per our purity.
				SP was free from lust - got down from vyas asana - obeissance cuz I am free from lust.
					Driver speaking thru mirror to SP - some kinda swami - sit on nails for meditation - can sit among room full of naked women and unaffected - wooh!
					@kabaddi - as per capacity you go deep or not.
					Hefty guy - casually kabaddi-n and e1 holds and turns to come back. thinner guys just say kabaddi once and come back - at least safe.
				Sita in grief separated from Lord - so are we without KC.
					4 kinda people come to Lord - arto, artharthi, jijnasu, jnani.
					In kali arto is prominent.
					walking like zombie under unconscious state - mind holds captive and tortures like Ravan.
					Hanuman sings song of Lord Ram - Sita rejuvenated. Guru creates hope in soul - possible to get association of Lord.
				7 phases of vayu - his son being hanuman - 7*7 = 49.
				Saturday important for worshipping hanumanji for this reason - 7 is important number for him.
				Hanuman makes analysis of situation and recommends to SPOG.
				Hanuman presents his case to Lord Ram. Guru presents case to Krishna.
			Why he does all this - WIIFM - Lord's embrace.
				Ram is waiting for reports or results - should I say I found Sita.
				I...didn't find Sita, found dead, etc - may collapse outta anxiety, expectation.
				Sita...was found, by me, dead, not alive, is gone, etc - Sita is safe.
				Finally he said Found Sita I - mood and emotion more important than grammar at that time.
					Of course, won't talk about Ravan.
			Dhanushkodi from where bridge starts.
				Thin piece of land making starts - even now some small tract of land goes inside.
				I have nothing to offer you - no money, etc so only embrace. Risks you have taken.
				This is what they hanker for - vanar means - va means like a man. Like man, monkey.
				Vrindavan - deadly monkeys - glasses stolen - better vision - taking away out position; we taking away Krisha's position.
				SP - banana and showed. and negotiation skills. Offer them sth and then they return it.
				va nar - like man in only appearance but beyond - godly - representing Krishna.
				Only reward is pleasure of Lord.
				Hanuman so satisfied that stays in material world - let me stay for your mission.
			Plans on attacking Lanka
				Vibhishan's advise to surrender - not worth it - enemy in guise of relative so go away.
				Comes to Lord Ram - friends, relatives may object with our dev's association.
				He had to make decision of coming to Lord Ram - no email discussions or confirmation but in uncertainty faith is tested.
				Will Lord accept - reliable sources - bhakta vatsal, deen vatsal, deen bandhu, deen nath so will give shelter.
				Based on what's heard will also work out - that's iota of faith.
				logic and reason help but stop at a point and there is a leap of faith.
				Other people like Sugriva and monkeys started blaspheming - being misunderstood is painful.
				Aage kuan peechhe khai was his situation - the message can be twisted - he is a spy for sure - born in lanka.
				We base our judgment based on where 7 is born - maybe demon like Ravan but some demon.
				Angad allow but set spies for him.
				Hanuman - you opinion - his face and intent pure and clear - left opulence at risk to take shelter.
					with faith that lord gives shelter.
				Sugriva - You don't know the clans and they are too dangerous. May set fire to our camps at night.
				Ram - about their power. You know who you are talking to - I am SPOG by the way.
					bring all species in front of me - most formidable rakshasas, danavas, etc - I can crush them with my index finger crush.
					My firm vow for all times to come - 7 comes in front of me - not even with full commitment - tava asmi - My dear Ram, I am yours.
					should become fearless. I make them fearless.
					See who standing outside - requesting my protection - even if Ravan requesting I will give him - unconditionally.
				Sugriva - Vibhishan is nice person. I will bring him in.
			So many pastimes during the fight.
			Hanumanji reports to Sita that Ramji victorious - craving for this.
				want to reward with opulence of this creation - my master, all rakshasis tormented you. Let me kill them.
				Under control of Ravan. Don't resort to such behavior.
				Sita Devi tells a story - Tiger chasing man and beer sleeping - man climbs - common enemy so throw him down.
					No he has taken my shelter. So won't.
					tiger plays politics - throw the bear down so opportunist and bear will taken away and you safe.
					bear seduced to throw the man saying that see what he did to you - no must stick to my dharma.
			Returned pastimes
				Vanars taken to Nandigram - banana leaf plate division.
					represent lord shares all opulence with jivas surrendered.
					also represents that jiva and Lord are separate.
				Ayodhya - we will follow hanuman - thanks for allowing us inside.
					jumping in front of me not in my control. Standard way of eating must be to jump and eat - blindly following me.
				Sita - kunkum powder - logic so if I cover my body with kunkum.
					dancing - red figure jumping up and down.
					Pleased with your simplicity only concerned with pleasing me and not public
				New schedules for seva - his name is nw
					we decided that so much service that made up for years of seva.
					no1 to do chutki when Ram yawns.
					Hanuman constantly sitting so gotta clap my fingers so must sit constantly. Greedy to serve Krishna to any capacity.
					Intimate associate of Lord Ram.
				Bedi Hanuman - high tide used to flood deities.
					Pandas to prevent flooding - hanuman can control - staying as guard.
					Bored by eating khicadi. Ayodhya had so much opulence - puris, sabjis, laddus, kachoris.
					Service is right but want some good prasad.
					Ayodhya feast and next morning came back - ocean god waiting for this chance
					disappeared - jagannath why you left - from now on - special laddus made of dry fruits to him.
					but our faith is shattered - maybe fed up of laddus - chain around his legs so agreement.
					Dakshina to pujari and he shows the bedi to you.
				Many spiritualists in India - dvati, advaita, mayavad, Vainavite, demigod worshippers and khicadi.
					all of them agree that hanuman is wonderful.
					Gyms in India have murti of hanumanji - gimme power of muscle - but don't know spiritual side.
					Need a girl for marriage from hanumanji - he is brahmacari - that's why - he will be detached to give me.
			May we get power to engage in service without need for credits and all.
				same spirit of giving credits to others and not want for ourselves.

			<Lecture1>
			BG - janma karma ca me divyam
			Intro
				divya means aalokik - svarg - here aprakrit - spiritual.
					no more birth - where he goes? Back to me.
				Place, day we discussing KK is our fortune.
				bhaga+vaan - all opulence + possessor - Vishnu purana parashar defines 6 ops.
					outta respect also - bhagavan narad, shuka, maitreya but also a vaastavik artha - that's Krishna only.
			Arjuna told that gave to Ikshvaku - that's so long back.
				when comes? dharma ki glani, etc.
				what you do? destroy, protect, establish dharma.
			7th garbha uda diya - ppl thought thru tantrik - Rohini transferred thru yoga maya.
				anshon ke saath Krishna enterred
			Vasudev 1 name - anant dundubhi - trumpet. He will be father to God.
				all demigods waited for Vasudev after forecast - played these 2 instruments.
				atoms in earth can be counted by all demigods (not possible as such) but not my names and qualities.
			Kamsa maara gya not that I killed. Krishna's said.
			He appeared in the mind - not thru maithun or dhatu.
				He started glowing like sun. No1 can see sun directly - such tej that no1 could see - even for 7 to appreoach difficult - defeating very.
				He transplanted Krishna to the mind to Devaki - she accepted like moon (anandkar)
				sun and moon analogies - tej utna nahi bikher rahe the.
				janma nahi diya - mool karana nahi - east direction doesn't give birth to sun or prachi disha to moon.
				Krishna is svayambhu but can be dharan not originated.
				What resides in Krishna - resides inside Devaki.
				Had Krishna but not sushobhit - like knowledge holder doesn't share or light inside a pot.
					so attraction to Krishna not possible in there - Devaki if she gave pravacan then upakar possible but not possible here in prison.
					If SP didn't share, that would not have been good.
					That's why Vaishnavas must preach - first establish Krishna in oneself and then share it with others.
			Kamsa went to see - he must have kept track thru calendars or whatever ?or thru ppl. Or just to meet.
				Karagrih looked beautiful - anand ew - prison became dham.
				Suci means clean but also sukh - mild smile on Devaki.
				If iron pot has hot coal - the pot will also burn - she also showed happiness, forgetting all pain of previous children.
				He estimated hari gonna hara my praana is gonna appear.
					Kalanemi had killed me b4 - Narada had told - jaan maara tha.
					He knew the potential and power of hari - cuz she wasn't that pleasurable b4.
					She used to be in great pain.
			Kamsa thoughts on Seeing Devaki happy
				Vaikuntha left and is here - death is here - he will definitely kill - is closer now than b4.
				He thought let's now better kill devaki only - uterus also gone but Krishna's presence non-violent and compassion - no, no!
				I can't degrade my name for history. Woman, sister, respected man I am.
					My age, opulence, reputation will be all gone. Brahma reduces life span.
				she was man b4 in previous life.
				Person who lives at killing others - that life is worthless - strange it is that kills child easily but not killing sister.
				Torturing jivas for oneself has no right to live - killing human and animals to live.
				Outta fear, ppl don't say on his face but after his death, wish all bad to him. Wish all hell to him.
				Muhavara - Kaji's dog died e1 went (to please him). Kaji died, no1 went (he doesn't matter anymore)
				after death - natural diet for vultures, jackals - why keep decorating it.
				Hell is tamah literally - no light department there only st when 7 is to be burnt - torturing one's relative goes there.
					Kamsa was better off than ppl of these days - believed in hell.
				Prabhu addressed to Kamsa - such defeating one's nature.
					Devs prabhu not ishwar but suppress the lower nature. ?also my master attitude.
			but enmity for God is not gone - explicitly mentioned by Shukadev.
				such wait is inspirational to devs - shown by Kamsa but was miserable cuz fear and envy. Envy was shishupal mainly - kamsa was mainly fear.
				very less sleep and there also thinking hari. In food, remembered Krishna.
				Unfavorable but very viscous remembrance.
				He's gonna kill asuras but I am top on hitlist ain't gonna leave me.
				Used to talk vishnu with others also.
				Vishnu chhal and kapati coming as child but gonna kill - like masking as innocent so gotta kill he thought.
				He saw world vishnu-maya. Janmashtami day like us must have fasted.
			All demigods appeared to Kamsa or Krishna
				Terrorists had made life into hell at that time.
				Krishna natavar and shiva nataraj - devs waiting for Krishna like chatak.
					demigods like elephants - pained by heat waiting for the rain - agha, etc asuras very torturous.
					We have come like them not vv - giving your analogy is not considered ok.
				Baby in womb is bent and scorched but praised at that time.
				You are satya sankalp - you said you will come and here you are. Also satya vrata.
					1 vrata - many but 1 of them - If once you say, I am yours => I will make him fearless - In context of vibhishan he said.
					If ravan bro, then like him so arrest him - let him come with the attitude said Rama.
					His lilas are satya - our existence itself is not satya (temporary)
			QA? Here discussion on pastimes; let's take technical questions some other time; philosophical questions not vicharaniya (worth thinking) at this point.
			</Lecture1>
			<Lecture2>
			Ashtami has half moon but Krishna's birthday full moon.
				cuz Krishna taking birth in his vansh.
				Pay attention to SB shlokas - it is clear.
				Moon appears from east not takes birth from there similarly Krishna appears to Devaki.
				Devaki also not pancha bhuta like Krishna.
			Vasudev saw Krishna appear - lotus full mature open eyes unlike common babies.
				4 arms and shankh, chakra, gada, padma holding.
				shriji on left side of chest.
				Ornaments of kaustubh looked good on him - Ornaments are decorated by Krishna.
					even tattered clothes would look good on him.
					uttari and ?payodhan both good.
					No1 takes birth in underwear from garbh.
				kuntal kesha - curly hair.
				everything adbhuta.
					saw very closely and concluded Vishnu or parabrahma.
					Krishna - krishi for earth vacak and na is anand vacak - base of all happiness is Krishna.
				I am conditioned maya adhin jiva and further still adhin under kamsa's prison.
					Kamsa, etc also conditioned or maya adheen but I am also inside prison inside the prison.
					how can Krishna show himself to me and take birth from her.
				Even normal child is celebrated what of Krishna - he took bath and gave mental donation of 10K cows.
					Later after kamsa killed the sankalp was fulfilled.
					This listening janma katha is also utsav or celebration of appearance.
				O Krishna. Please hide yourself. Kamsa will punish if he sees you.
					Krishna laughs and tells the past life of both.
					Same form you worshipped me with, I am appearing in that form - no form changing for Krishna.
					Treat me like Vishnu or child anyway.
					I will go to mathura and then come back to you.
					If you are fearful of Kamsa then take me to Gokula.
			Vasudev takes Krishna to Gokul.
				Some mahanubhav say that Krishna was taken in peti.
				Milk was fed once to Krishna from Devaki b4 this.
				yoga maya abducted the knowledge of e1 in mathura - like mike if no electricity structure exists - receives but can't produce.
				e1 standing but could not see, or hear. no1 could say even.
				Dvaarpaal - Durga Devi also called Nidra - even we sleep by her grace.
					Night workers is Nishacar - st devs do but for Krishna but generally asuras, etc do that.
				Krishna vaahak - carrying like a vehicle for Krishna.
				His presence removes all darkness - not that he beats it out.
					all doors opening without noise and even locks - no remote controlled but svatah - Krishna's energy.
				Cloud were rumbling mildly - no disturbance but service.
					sheshnag going with Krishna.
					should not forget my service attitude although agraj in this life.
				Raining a lot - why Indra doing it.
					So that no1 would come out and easy for Vasudev to take Krishna.
				Yamuna vikaral that day. Yamraj's sister.
					He took Krishna with him and intending to raise Krishna and swimming with one hand but touched Krishna's feet and dropped.
			Reached Gokula
				all slept - under yoga maya.
				He should not wake up and cry then would be interrogated.
				So with care and relaxing child - took yashoda's child and replaced with Krishna.
				replaced children and came back and put shackles back to himself.
			Kamsa comes to kill the daughter.
			Celebrations happen in Gokula.

				Badinath Travelling devs - We invent such vehicles which come with their accuracy and probability of success.

					Material nature will work as it must.
				Aindra Pr - SP in his direction said just sing for Krishna. shaligram leaving body.
				Yamuna Mataji - left body while chanting.
					Bhaav in singing Govindam Adi Purusham - one of the my initial attractions in college.
					Preaching in Europe (tough challenges like sitting in construction pipes) and inspiring Beetles and Cooking in KC.
				Gaur Krishna M - His sweet Vidur Uddhav Samvad and MB, etc. SA talk.
				Bhakti Charu Swami - Sweet Kirtans. How are you gentleman. Send prasadam to my room.
					Translated CC to Bengali (need confirmation)
				Rashik Kumar Pr, Lakshya Pr, BHU famous devotee - many pastimes, etc.
					Very heart broken to hear this news about Rasik Kumar Pr. My fortune to have met this glorious devotee.
						Leaving body also for the cause of others - to help a friend who had contracted covid.
						can't forget that we are in material world - material body is not a perfect instrument to serve Krishna cuz it is bound by prakriti.
					He was always encouraging, non-judgmental, loving and ever happy.
					His happiness was contagious - how much he was inspiring in my life. He used to say and also examplify - being happy in Krishna consciousness is greatest preaching.
						Now, this mahatma has gone to spread happiness other places. He used to arrange for devotional connection like skype for all the devs. That's why called cintamani.
						His name used to be first for any service said his counselor.
					Complete person in KC - VA, KC, etc.
					Giving lift on vehicle for counselee meeting - talking KC all the while.
						I said vishnuduta can take us to reach Krishna in form of his lilas, qualities.
						escorting devs from counselor meeting to place where bus could be taken.
					Bhakti Vinod Thakur - he reasons ill who thinks Vaishnavas die. While thou art living still in sound, Vaishnavas die to live and living spreads holy names around.
						Surprisingly departure of Vaishnava is also celebrated - we feel remorse of separation but happy for his destination.
					Kada ruddho bhavishyati - take KC very seriously; such a force he was. As prji mentioned - his determination and happiness in KC was a proof of the process.
					Others
						He could glorify anybody even stone. Genuine. Honest.
							Don't know the process but if he is practicing it so happy then it must be true.
						he used to not just balance but as if he had all the time for everyone - all ppl in SVAF his fan.
						used to give alms to beggars in exchange of HN chanted.
						Personal and showing attention. Doing IBC Service even when sick. SMS to all devs.
						RSP - Krishna purifies over lives like shilpakar makes murti over different days.
							disturbance that leaves so early - like LCM and Shankaracharya - no use living like trees.
							we come with expiry date on head.
							BODD is always painful - what we do in middle is the power.
							sand particles are together for time being. Take guidance to stay steady in turbulent times.
						After hearing glories of him and devs - I feel like I am an animal.
							participated dramas.
						Praising others that you are voice devotee I am not such trained. Used to give huge donations.
						a dev in problem, arranged for tickets for him and escorted him to airport and booked a taxi in another city.
						Not able to start program cuz limited devs - he said he would arrange for people - so enthu - ppl used to speak about him.
				Pankajanghri Pr - purifying sanskar.
					Where is shaligram. Glowing shaligram of Nrisimha. spiritual world sound in shankh.
					Deity worship dedication - spiritual life is easy and simple - what's promotion asked in USA - that's in consciousness.
					For sake of worldwide protection of devs - showcased how to be humble
						materially unqualified (don't see behind wall or person) and spiritually unqualified - can't tell fruit vs fruit prasadam.
						so we will naturally be humble
				Bhari (Balram Hari) Malhotra Ji - Met SP numerous times and was pivotal for success of ISKCON Pune.
					Benarji, a friend, had Balaji murti and temple arranged - wanted to give to ISKCON.
					travelled from pakistan so when got food - started food for life.
					He brought SP in Pune and SP said we should have temple here - followed up - I have donated but no temple - under clearance.
					Money no problem. Give karma vacan money to Krishna with such a dedication that's an eg.
					SP told him Krishna should have Radha deity also. No non-veg.
					Chanting Radhe every 10 mins b4 leaving. Extreme difficulty.
					Emergency items for dandi yatra Valkiris. light, kambal, etc.
					KY to BY after SP. 5 years FFL thru ISKCON.

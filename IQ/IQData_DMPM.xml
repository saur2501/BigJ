        Mastering any layer in DevOps Career (talking at Business, UI, Application, DB)
        About -
            Applies to Properties, attributes, data model terms.
            At different tiers of functioning.
            Identify all the features - and study the following.
        Life - Create, Delete
        Read - Retrieve (itself and its associations)
        Write - Update, enrich, Action (on it)
        Persist - Save the changes
        Check - check for state, check for transition
        viz or eg -
            A2X service to update PCT (create new item and update another) but tags for actions also supported - presence of an element can mean an action.
                //that means sequence of jobs - first update, next trigger an action.
                exits that do it for us -
                    Modify Call - modify call for update
                        extract the data - automated thru compare to schema definition. thru MBG mapping get all the BO Data.
                        identify the delta - ??
                        write it - BO modify - write the observed delta thru modify call.
                    Action Call -
                        mapping tag to action class - MBF Exit.
                        call to the action - execute_action on BO.
        Another possible view is FDDL - Power, Money, Contributions, Fun.
            Other views - arch, manager, consultant, etc.

                    I used ABAP based eclipse studio for ABAP development instead of ABAP logon - what benefits did it give me?
                            text selection and see all references, navigation and find references are common.
            IQ Lapse - Low level JSON creation on your own. Instead, use JSON.stringify, which (a) works, (b) is faster, and (c) will actually produce a valid JSON.
                    but don't reinvest time.
                    var obj = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };
                    obj.prop = 'hi';
                    obj.name = "Krishna"
                    var myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
            IQ Grats
                    JSON Array sorting using sort with function(a,b) argument for sorting
                    convert json strings to numbers using prefix + and that's all and number into string thru ""+ prefix.
            Lapse - not
                    IR failing message to GSA - can the message be cancelled if IR is delivered and PO cancelled - another PO for it with GSAs all consumed so all IR ordered have their goods received.
                            you can't cancel PO without deleting all follow up documents.
            Lapse
                    why can't I change the name on package.json - it give me error! - need to know how technologies are working in our project!
            Lapse
                    didn't see condition of length less than or equal to 0 then write it on buffer.
                    not - else part could be removed
            Lapse
                    I need some sample to implement - why don't you explore the code to decide on the method signatures and configuration file also - that also has a signature cuz that's gonna repeat itself so must be validated.
                    Thumb rule - if I don't know it, can I find it out instead of asking someone.
            Lapse
                    dump on ui - read server logs what error tells you.
                    x4 run build after install to update our links to it as well.
                    local linking trial - it worked but I had to remember to update git skipping those file changes.
                            if local ain't working - try global where you mention that file of this name - pick this version.
                    create modifications not coming as expected because savetransaction not saved before - then clean then use.Manager -
                    Scrum - Any backlog create subtasks and track them individually - that's when it is ready for development status and not in process.
                            1. API Calling using root and item data and getting response of confidence and criteria
                            2. Create Approval Task
                            3. Close Approval Task based on confidence level
                    Cross Functional TofT - disassociating TofT hard mapping to functional areas and making it soft mapping - which switches over sprints.
            Lapse - personal solution
                    Callbacks don't wait - solution encapsulate them inside a promise and use await while calling that promise.
            Lapse Not
                    no data type assigned to variable and then used undefined so data type can't be converted at runtime.
                    async for the callback function in which await is being used.
                    same data type used in 2 contexts - change the name of 1.
            Lapse NOT
                    Why task not getting created - I have the feeling that compilation has not been done - worked after that.
                    Description default without product cuz product gets created on item creation cuz field is being used so put condition on product id empty that description should not be updated from the API or it should be updated from API and API returns empty string when empty product id is being passsed.
            Lapse NOT - executable files and assembly files or data files
            Lapse
                    using static variables in web application can be taken with great caution because of racing of threads for shared method and variables.
                    7 else's - even racing for id number generation - that's dangerous - you read and add the new number to the list - it's just the matter of who read what portion when.

            Lapse EQ - Door locked - gotta call a friend in dead of the night.
            Lapse - EQ - Pollution Certificate for the first time
                    Purse fell and didn't even realize it - didn't even properly thank the holders cuz of excitement of having found it.
                    He taking picture with his device and I put my RC in front of that.
                    Once before my debit card had fallen while filling petrol in my vehicle.
                    Solution - After every task, saying to yourself that you have done it means 100% confident and aware that it's done.
                            after every activity, saying that it's done means 100% confidence that it's being done.
            Lapse - IQ - /SRMAP/IF_FND_CHECKPOINTS~CHECKPOINT_EVENTS - undermined.
                    call from handle_events of proc_doc_update - meaning ttl enrichment happens during events. I just ignored it but finding in CL_CONTEXT was helpful.
            Lapse - IQ - The UI Designer shows no mapping for a UI Component
                    Option 1 - debug and find out how it works where it does.
                    Option 2 - Check XML - go 1 layer below of its working and see if sth is off (recommended)
            IQGrats - Idea of not storing the image blob for every BO's Item Product thereby saving space.
                I suggested filename but better idea was the UUID, even a separate table holding blob will have worked cuz same image showing up at multiple places.
                In discussion, your code is taken as benchmark for further development.

                    template method pattern for approval
                    guarantee all or none thru exception try catch.
                    informed team mate about racing condition possible for number range generation - solution will be make static methods and use synchronize.
                    Proposed the idea of command design pattern on changed attributes on specific nodes and DAG changes on that
                            but idea forwarded to framework team cuz time saving and no redoing by every application area - this was observed by 1 of the senior colleagues also.
                    GIT find my old commit id
                            git log -10000 | grep "(my comment substring)" -B 5 -A 1
                    comparing git files across 2 commits or branches
                    UML for Java Media Player in college time.
                    atomic execution of methods - long standing bug solved - all or none execution of method.
                            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16902224/executing-block-of-code-atomically
                            the problem was approval task created or closed but the document is still in the old status or vv.
                    teams excel - reversed the weeks in weekly track of assigned uiat
                            freezing helps freeze column panes still gotta traverse to last column to update
                            then top row is not frozen so you can't see which week you are on so time wasted, so reversing the sequence makes things easy for the team.
            IQGrats - ML in NSME ByD
                    can't use our choices as data
                    input for next choices in threshold
                    eval in ML App IR - let them choose threshold itself
                    expanding window method - costly
                    bins - way to go - backward traversal until bin lower than threshold is found.
                            can have expectation of %of data points in a bin to be significant enough - size of bin can be accordingly.
                            ignore not defined but bin size such that data points in bin >= % of total data point.
                    alternate approach find threshold confidence once vs given a confidence level, find the bin window percentage should be greater than say 95%
                    other ideas - largest confidence which got rejected - ideal world - outlier can spoil the show - 1 in 1M but not allowed
                    point of confidence where % of approval > % of rejection - very poor basis of auto-approval - many bad eg will come.
                    point where P(A|conf) >= 95% - it is different from confidence which is sigmoid function or combination of functions which no longer mean odds of approval.
                    minimal value for approval (bad choice)
                    75th quartile of approval
                            sql queries available but again distribution can be crazy. coming up with counter eg is possible. Think again!
                    cumulative area - bad choice cuz of distribution can be really crazy. Area till confidence c >= 75% nay.
                            simpler but undesirable
                    1 thing we should definitely do based on our ML, is give tooltip of approval percentage and criteria - we are gonna cuz sending confidence and description to BTM.
                    graph of rejection and approval will look like intersecting log and exponential curves. Normal distribution doesn't apply. But zipfian will.
                            what about finding point of 75% on zipfian distribution - that can be pretty neat idea, aye.
            IQGrats - callback used by rest call request - wrap it inside a promise. and call promise under await.
                    That's right we don't auto-approve shopping cart without user's configuration on confidence. We just propose how confident we are about approval.
            IQGrats - Save not ending - cause found after material check before save
                    but why is it coming in first place - cuz lcp creation on material adds to a map in service manager and it member lcpTransaction uses that map.
                            ServiceManager.js of line 121 - adds objectReference on create of an lcp instance - the same that lcpTransaction object also holds.
                    Is there something wrong with calling validations and determinations with no root node - no!
                    So, debugging with X4 typescript - need to put X4 within the workspace and link it with @sap/x4 symlink - and can debug X4.
                            Debugging X4 from S4One debugging - x4 download, install, build (creates symlink), link with the symlink, npm run build of s4one.
                    It was infinite recursion while finding all child nodes tree of the BO Material - DO "Root" is misconceived as BO "Root" resulting in infinite recursion.
            IQGrats - all services are our own - Foundational Master data objects are just Models in BO structures and we need to navigate thru them to get data of our interest.
                    Similarly BC must be also a business object with nodes and what its master data.
                    With typescript, working out the details of framework is much easier than previous frameworks.
                            findings - service manager is key to most of the things like message handler, lcp transaction object, object resource map (all lcps used), etc.
                            how the call ultimately lands with table query in X4; usage of finding all nodes under a given bo node for triggering more validations and determinations.
                            curiosities - how association navigation thru lcp works, etc.
                    using log services so important to keep track of where something goes for a toss.

                    ML Supplier determination while creating PR from IR requests without suppliers - assigned and then removed.
            IQGrats - wrote a code to convert ipynb to py format code.
                    didi told me that Jupyter already supports this conversion - I recalled I already knew it but had forgotten.
                    I had rejected at that time cuz I wanted to mass convert all the ipynb files and not opening them 1 by 1 in Jupyter before convert.
            IQGrats - Wrote a program to read all the whatsapp image and video files and fetch the images of babies by age for easy extraction than manual labor.
                    Wrote a program to arrange the notes by topics for easy organization.
                    Wrote a program to bulk convert ipynb files to py files.
            IQGrats - x4/obn/OBNRegistration table has all obn references -
                    I created and deleted FS_Copy file which still existed in the db - that's why it was loading that page
                    so changing versions creates and updates but doesn't delete the metadata in postgres.
                    select query on the table - to find if there is entry for copy - found it and used deleted query to delete it.
                    workaround - change the inport operation itself for both sides of OBN navigation and that screen will have no way to get uploaded but shit continues to exist in the table.
            IQGrats - Problem solved - debugging thru front end UI5 code -
                    so schema still asking for it and data ain't fetching it - data must be coming from byd layer OR we need to do some cleaning in cip sme we ain't doing.
                    found the bug - I had replaced the esf path to a wrong path to ui file - cuz of which the data was entirely being fetched from byd.
                    so byd was throwing complete ui data model much more than what current screen needs. So, when data model says write a value to ui model for visualizing - it can't because it doesn't even exist on the loaded screen.
                    please see the loaded screen is still from the sme only - why cuz in x4-app-package.json I still had the path to sme version of PO FS screen.
                    DP Problem - only 1 reference for the entity should be there - not multiple - else changing 1 and not the other always causes problems.
                    This also means that Oberon's job is to map BO/ECO to UI Data Model and throw it back to Front end.
                            Front end just paints it and some property level and minor data manipulations like Write description if Id had field set to description only or id and description.
            IQGrats - python has print string to be replaced by print(string) using regex replace.
                    print(\s)\w*\[?[\w:+*]*\]? to whatever and \s(\*|\+)\s to $1. and then print\s(\w*\[?[\w:+*]*\]?) by print($1).
                    print\s([\"\']?[\w\s:!]*[\"\']?) to print($1)
                    print(.*)(?=#) by print($1)

    Make Resume for all of PIES
            PIES - all of them require Bhakti while we are in material world - are they against KC - no, Krishna wants us do them. 
                    Of course, eventually all of them should stabilize (MOG) so that they are not impedance to KC but that's in very high stages of development
                    the basis of relationship can be client server or peer to peer (sadhu sang of stages of bhakti) on any of PIES.
                    B and J club together

                                    Case Studies fall under this (and not D - cuz they are not your own)

                    it is just expansion of the core philosophy of the thing - like Data Science stages of development and tell your trace thru them.
                    Ability to draw UML diagrams to explain specifications, architecture, tools used, validation, deployment, maintenance.
                    Also an opportunity to go into D and K specifics of the project

                                    Design - Fresh implementations so usage of many design patterns - singleton, strategy, template method, DAO, command, etc.
                                        ?saw working of an application server end to end.
                                        raising bugs, working on systems that are still stabilizing and not robust (eg colleagues on UI)
                                        Creating many stubs and skeletons.
                                    Implementations - GIT, VS Code, NPM, Node Express, REST API.

                                            UT cuz of less granular tests at attribute level 
                                            integration test should focus on less granular stuff - PR is created, PO is in this status - scenario specific.

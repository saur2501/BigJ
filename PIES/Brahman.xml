    <Intro>Read it as jnana pertaining to respective tag- all w5H studied.
            This studies only the principles that apply. No planning is done in this.
            Vision setting is in Bhakti.xml
        PIES is about jnana pertaining to 4 needs of happiness.
            PIES is driven not just by Interest (FDDL) but also dharma (alignment with God)
        Make all of my dhyan, jnana and karma into KY,DY,JY- that makes it so beautiful.
            Break it down in hierarchical structures to understand- XML and collapse, expand for BFS (not levelled traversal)
    </Intro>
    <Health>
        all factors affect one another, culminating in PIES excellence.
        <K>
            To achieve something- it takes conditions MET.
                it is in organising your jnanendriyas and karmendriyas for any fruit desireable)
            This has gotta do with not giving up when it is not interesting (persevering), stretching to limits hence growing ones stamina.
                else abstract out and see other relevant things like grammar/vocabulary of a speaker throwing bouncers.
            Karma done in teams (again abstraction); management is encapsulation.
            Karma is practice- engaging karmendriya, jnanendriya for the purpose.
            	How good are your instruments.
                    How to affect prakriti for effective living
                            Non-Living
                                    take services from standardized disciplines. (pay to them)
                                    do good karma (daan-faith)
                            Living
                                    be gacch. how others are doing we know. frienship we are 1.

                    implications of jiva as controller
                            Learn from past (my and others)
                            keep standardizing; I can do it confidense.
                            try try don't cry. My best. Never give up.
                            Discipline, determination, dedication/devotion, data rate (being fast in karma, jnan)
                            Desire is first step, deserve (Tapa- motivations can be FDDL= best is KC) is second.
                                    but we are not at that level (accept if we are at fear level)
                            Create Reward system
                                    identify rewards;
                                    milestone achieved- party!!
                    implication of ishwar
                            eth I go thru is for my good.
                                    things will conglomerate for my good. (have patience)
                                    designed for my good.
                                    but escapism (like drugs) we don't let them serve purpose.
                                            cortisol? stress! stress is when
                                                    not addressing the problems instances.
                                                    not changing the problem.
            Divided attention by PIES vs 1 work 1 aim 1 devtion
                    other aspects of PIES matter for happiness.

            CS Software Engineering Discipline (any discipline for that matter, even society)
                In interview, you should be able to answer questions at all steps.
                [Problems- abstract of problem instances]
                Vision of your perfect "world"
                Solution Devised/ Protocols set (knowing your powers- what we can do)- Researchers/ Business people work here- low/ high level
                Requirements- how customer should see the final product (look and feel (statecharts), description (usecase))
                        scope is decided.
                Design- how programmer (implementer) should go about (what all am I gonna do in HLD- blueprint)
                        How DB schema should look?
                Coding/Implementation- rollup sleeves, get down to work.
                        DDL of database. Then apps, DML of DB, etc.
                Testing- What I implemented promises to deliver as per design (integration testing), and is what client expected (systems testing)
                        cover all classes of scenarios- desirable effect.
                        Eg- for society, Supreme courts.
                Deployment/Selling- put to practice- does it solve the problems it promised?
                Maintenance- support for the solution- client faces a prob?

            How- Study things in abstraction. Following Layered Approach.            
                J comes from D and K for cultivation or K for some SQ.
                Recitations, Revisions, Practical. (daily,weekly,monthly)
                    We tend to forget with time so revisions are incumbent.
            J is sheer pleasure/excitement (flow of events,capabilities,evolution of society). D is sheer pleasure. Where useful in K for P is secondary.
            Why? Any approach to knowledge should yield- 
                1. world-view
                        Practically demonstrable-> Karma => Stand/ Confidense of my capability (write-able in resume)
                        J influences D (outlook)- how u see what u see. cultivate understandings
                2. vocabulary- use them like butter.
                3. Karma Stand- confidense in the capability you have cultivated.
                    J enables you for career when you take a K stand of it.
            Stages to Learning anything (eg - SIV KT, SCM Course, Coursera ML)
                    Shravanam - Listen (inline quiz for alertness, understanding check and recall of important pivotal concepts)
                            this is opportunity for all architectural talks - why this and not that; advantages, disadvantages; how this and how that (what about that aspect); what this and that as engr.
                    Mananam - Revise - See and verbally Revise / Index based Recall / Recitation all along 
                    Nidhidhyasanam - ?Situational Quiz (challenge those ideas on a little higher layer)
                            if not possible then put in real life situations like solving tickets and have it done.
                    Sakshatkar - Practical - see it working as a user and as a developer - realise those ideas and talk along.
                            standardize the outcomes if possible.
                    Samadhi - Reading - explore other aspects for depth of understanding of concepts.

            2 types
                awareness- BFS
                focus/attention/absorption- DFS
            dhyan will direct consciousness on objects.
            Life is nth but streaks of Dhyan.
            While you are in Dhyaan of 1 thing- everything else is non-existing (targets to achieve, deadlines to meet, knowledge to demonstrate)
                You are lost into it.
            Dhyaan on Sense Objects is so natural and that on uplifting items is somewhat an effort (but pays off)- (not really if in alignment with your nature)
                Soul has desire to enjoy separate.
            This advocates my outlook toward things. (advocated by Jnana) for any karma.	
            while doing VA, just focus and write down sth of concern and reflect or svadhyaya in evening for update your devotion.		
            dhyan will determine Event responses pertaining to scenarios.
            While in Dhyan, the 'What if' don't exist (confidense, absorption)
        </D>
        <B>
            aka kernel, aka svadhyaya, aka bigger picture.
            Priority of work decided by - 
                concerns (that important for project or task at hand - can't wait) > needs (matter on resume, experience, kartavya (should do/know/be), expected) > Interest (future plans)
                Scrum planning can be done and should be done on needs and interests ; adhere to it as much as possible but plan for sure.
                The time allocation is important but after hours is sharpening the saw - if you could not achieve it in working hours, then why not, fix the missing link in after hours.

                    Goal- Break your last best.

                    why so much in depth knowledge - issues with politics or emotional manipulations, etc
                        necessary for my survival - better strategies, calmer, story telling, putting knowledge to good use instead of manipulation
                        help me in my yoga process with more mature thought of world, analysis of pastimes, etc.
                        goes with my subtle body to next life just in case.
                        helps those I discuss the subject matters with - peace is necessary for a good spiritual life - a little trouble is ok but too much ain't healthy.
                        if write book or thru influencing - legacy to help generation after generation

                Peer and Associations (applies to PIES)
                        Discussion Types as follows
                        All need language command in common - Grammar, Vocab, Jokes/poetry/Decor, opinions
                                Eg - not married, still roaming? - no still independent (or free)
                        all discussion types of a stage includes the below ones.
                                trying something of higher layers can be risky with 
                                        "It's none of your business", "excuse me", "Did I ask", "Yeah!!!"
                                        or even a jerk response - where you feel burnt.
                        the very discussion on the basis of closeness is obvious 
                                Eg - project guys will talk about project and also the knowledge (theory and applicational theory - why we do it like this)
                        one should always endeavor to take the relationship to the next level if it's possible.
                                make a list of people and where they fall.
                        Basis - lines are not strict but fundamentals are.
                                Rapport - Oneness (open heart)
                                        understand each other's feelings or ideas and communicate well
                                        How - be yourself.
                                Friendly (>=1 Center of Attractions) - more than 1 reason that you are together
                                        Strictly Informal - Participation in stories (Problem Solving, Joy Sharing w/o fear (making vulnerable)
                                                Even open talks - Eg - I saw you scared like a little girl when you saw fire coming to you.
                                                How - available for them.
                                                also called best friends (but there is difference between best friend vs wife)
                                        Informal Touch - Personal Stories (with caution) which reveal value system (risk of disagreements)
                                                Even seek stories from other person - 
                                                        Eg - have your encountered any such situation when...
                                                these show a little bit of your vulnerable side and of course your achievements - risk of being considered proud.
                                                risk of being judged
                                                How - Know yourself, your life, your adventures.
                                Companions (1 Center of Attraction - why you are together anyways)
                                        Formal Touch - Small Talk (Sit together with formal reasons), 
                                                casual stories allowed (resume type - like my friend made a 2-D anti-missile)
                                                How - News + School knowledge + interpretations (speak non-controversial)
                                                Eg - Lunch with team members, Travel together on company tour, etc.
                                        Strictly Formal - Titbits (from news - of all types - sports, media, politics, etc)
                                                How - being broker of news (in project to social circles (includes company, etc))
                                                        can be casual - eg lots of tickets these days or lots of gdpr.
                                                we can't do small talk with them cuz don't get to sit with them.
                                                Eg - IIITB Studs, ByD Emps, OOAD Project Group, Semantic Web Group
                                                        smaller groups are opportunities for making the relationship go to the next level.
                                Stranger - casual services (give and expect) - where is that restaurant.
                                        know him by face but don't talk also can come under this.
                                Exploitor, enemy, etc - Assert yourself, self love, speak up, take a stand, discuss things head on.
                        Eg - Demonetization and friend not willing to travel on the same cab (of course fare saving) - why cuz no titbits with him.
                        For marriage, coming from strong friendship 
                                first know yourself (so that n-center of attractions are possible)
                                        and value system can be evaluated.
                                        self love - seek your joy and make plans and projects for yourself.
                                        Take your inventory - Sports I like; Music I like; Movies I like; Buying things I like; Adventures I like; Hobbies; etc.
                                also important that the relationships pervades across gender, states, caste, bodily features (skin-tone, body built, etc), religion, etc.
                                although these things help - cuz clustering of these groups happened because of similarity of subtle bodies 
                                        but it's not clustering on eth that defines you. 
                                        it is not that strict of a rule of substantial difference and that geographical distance = clustering distance.
                                going thru stages may not be necessary 
                                        eg - some people directly approach that I have crush on you - let's party.
                                        eg - I like your looks - can we meet more often. Eg - Tinder
                        It will be wrong to say that our education system is job centric
                                it is all PIES centered - Yoga, Sports, PT; Specializations; All kinda knowledge, communication devices, languages, Prayers in the morning.
                                but value education, religion neutral/agnostic study of philosophy is not there to a good extent.
                                Eg - moral education in japan; Law of equivalent exchange, yam niyam, etc.

                                    #Bhakti vs SQ- Bhakti is Kernel (ideals and goals and plans),SQ is satisfaction at the level of self (heart/soul). Bhakti plans for SQ. So maybe replace all prev SQ by bhakti (but synonymous)

            Vikalpon ka sansar- our choices determine our destiny.
                moment after moment we have choice- sleep, svadhyaya.
                Pursue but amount to little at death. money, cars, titles- seductions fall away.
		1. Who did you become- 
			day were platforms for greater greatness- 
			leveraged suffering to wisdom, compassion, creative, release/ realize potential.
		2. Whom did you help- make others happy. Servant leadership- great builders- to as many as possible.
			no holes within you- be a giver of world.
			so much in love with the potential and joy- self worth and wisdom so full- walk into communities and giving.
			more clients rush to you. More you give, more you open ways to receive from world.
            jiva, prakriti, ishwar- 3 doers.
            Focus on what you want and not what you don't
                I don't care for haters, I am too busy with those who love me.
            Rabindra Nath Tagore- Spring has passed. Summer has gone, winter is here... 
		and the song I meant to sing remains unsung.
		for I have spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument.
		Pursuits that matter little- busy being busy.
		Focus on few priorities that will be legendary.
            Rabindra Nath Tagore and Father- 
		When you were born, you cried while the world rejoiced. Live your life in such a way that when you die, the world cries while you rejoice.
		To Lead is to serve. To win is to be helpful.
		Nth matter more than impact on humanity.
		status, home- won't matter on death bed- were you instrument of service As many people as possible.
            Ideology- Pupose, Vision, Kernel Design (Kernel running (bhakti) is being conscious of these)
                    Why?		
                            live life by design (choice) and not default (chance)- (Design in SE)
                                    eth I say, believe, write is heartfelt.
                                    If you don't act life, she will.
                                    you drive it (not driven by circumstances)
                                            Eg- I went to Afganistan cuz that's where the road took me.
                            Not broader picture-> imbalanced life
                                    broader picture- in touch with my purpose, priority set.
                                    eg- 
                                            moon but fight neighbor.
                                            timely missiles but forget date with children
                                    equipments for networking but don't network.
                    What?
                            Contrib- achieve worth achieving
                                    PIES
                            Birth- you cried, world rejoiced; death- you rejoice, world cry.
                                    how many lives were touched, legacy
                                    life of contrib, meaning.
                            live more deliverately, more joyfully, completely.
                                    full justice to my talents (capabilities (innate and cultivated)), resources, contacts, etc
                                    regret of half lived life. "person I could have been but never was"
                                    enjoy the journey of life b4 it's late.
                    How
                            Find your calling- manifest highest potential while adding value.
                                    our unique purpose
                            Bring more of yourself into work
                            focus on things you do best, don't wait for people to make changes you desire.
                                    be the change you want to see in the world.

                    distilled a compilation- help you transform
                            let me know application in your life.
                    gain the wisdom and then apply it.
                            knowing not sufficient.
            Life means tapasya (creating your ideal life and beyond)- life is meant for tapasya.
		tapa doesn't mean being miserable but doing the abhideya for prayojan.
		man na karna
			ideally it's best when man is with you 
			spend some time taking inventory of your prayojans
				 fantasize
				 associate with role models 
				 and then run in high steam
			you walk and mind follows (it has to) 
		Getting stuck
			postpone what can be done later- do justice to now- do sth else
			abstract out and see where pipe is stuck in chalked out plan.
			ask/discuss with client- try alternatives- make logs of what all u tried.
			where's the flow blocking- address that thru discussion, alternatives, delegation, asking for help outside.

                        1. Improv Comedy- being funny in front of strangers is terrifying (pushes comfort zone)
                                Otherwise, people run out of topics to talk about.
                                Nth to go off. Audience shouts and you've to riff off. Not just stage but everywhere it happens (7 gives you conversational threat, riff on that and continue(even when they stall))
                        2. Toastmasters- nationwide- chapters ew- help people public speak. We are talking best speak- promotion,etc- but e1 there to learn.
                                Struggling vs 7 in audience says filler words you do (no of times)

                                It becomes easy to face situ where the stakes are just social.
                        4. Experimenting with first impressions- Any night event- boring story, fact about yourself, (not that you are gonna be in bathroom so forth), first 2 mins, they excuse themselves
                                Real time feedback, what is interesting to stranger and what's boring.
                                Pay attention to this- split test- talk different stuffs and see response. Ppl fascinated by my interesting jobs or my passion.
                                Whenever leave the event- check what worked and what didn't- what was difference. clear head with docs.

                            read sat as "what is" - jo hai. eternity is a lose translation focusing only on our being aspect. it can be extended also
                    Eg - Being/ Become/ Recognized (P), Values (sustained A), beliefs (present A)
                    I - Achieve (P), Determine (sustained A), discriminate (present A)
                    M - Feeling (P), Willing (sustained A), Thinking (present A)

                Passion for Narratives with incentives understood
                        About 
                                mostly narrative is with desire platform
                                look for stability in all of them (MOG) so that the duty platform can be carried out (within that layer and across - PIES are interrelated!!)
                                        opportunity to rise to what's beyond - what's this factor important for anyway.
                                Associations are not just about server-client and peer to peer for helping mutual narratives but also replaying past pleasures be it mental or intellectual layers 
                                        Eg - remember the way he said that haha, 
                                                replaying standard jokes in the situations.
                                        Eg - lambda would reboot after 3 hrs - so what we did, we would ping the machine every 10 minutes to keep it alive; 
                                                everybody pinging me to set it - I put breakpoint of dump for version control and reverted and then reset my code.
                                        So, it is also important to keep track of your pleasures and challenges thru the day and future plans to discuss with relevant people.
                                                daily scrum - individual or with team or with similar minded people is sharing of such joys and discussing challenges.
                                        FDDL - Discussions in Association (not association itself) also comes under this.

                                                                Duty is utility that it yields which eventually leads to results of higher layer.
                                                                @Business Apps vs Framework Apps.
                                                        Relevant vs all 
                                                                Preferably discussions with relevant people but even outside also interesting. 
                                                                Like talking entertainment with office team can be interesting and ok - but not the most ideal case.
                                                                        can be thought of as a utility for breaking the ice.

                                                Desire - I - My achievements adored. Replaying past problems solved.
                                                Duty - allies - helps me achieve my narrative (can be desire if association and not discussion in association)
                                                Love - Liking the sheer interaction itself.
                                                        News - what's going on (within and without). Information exchanges.

            <PQ>Health- physical, metabolism, mind.
                Health is the crown on the well person's head that only the ill person can see.
                    we take for granted until we lose it.

			Belly fat is problem not body fat. Metabolic probs linked to it.
			0.Track food (what and how much)
				1. Avoid eating sugar and beverages.
					liver forced to convert fructose to fat (only place of metabolism)-> insulin resistance-> metabolic probs.
					beverages- brain doesn't register liquid so end up eating more.
					Fruits-  which are extremely healthy and have plenty of fiber that mitigates the negative effects of (negligible) fructose.
						fruits and vegetables linked to reduced amounts.
				2. refined carbs (white breads, pastas, etc)
					carbs cut (to 50g/day) => appetite goes down (in good way), ketosis (burning of fat) starts => lose weight (target belly fat and organs (Caution of too much))
					low-carb allowed to eat as much vs restricted low-fat- 2-3 times effective former 
						(instant results of water reduction)
				2.5. vegetable oils (coconut oil exception) were linked to increased amounts of belly fat
				3. Eat fiber (indigestible plant part) rich foods
					viscous ones- slow the digestion and absorption- giving u feeling of fullness and less appetite.
					eat a lot of plant foods like vegetables and fruit; legumes and cereals like oats also.
				4. Eat more protein (esp animal- dairy) best long term strategy- 25-30% of calories
					reduce cravings by 60%
					single most effective way you can do- to lose weight (reduce belly fat) and avoid regain.
				Exercise
				5. Aerobic exercise
					long, healthy life, avoid diseases.
					crunches doon't reduce belly fat (6 months no effect)
					walking, running, swimming, etc shown reductions
					prevented from regain.
					Exercise also leads to reduced inflammation, blood sugar levels and all the other metabolic abnormalities that are associated with central obesity
				
			Fasting
				speed up metabolism- cuz digestive system gets rest and healthy bowel movement.
					increased lifespan (trends)
					Neural system-
						improved brain function- release of BDNF protein- make new neurons and chemicals for neural health.
					immune system- reduces free radical damage,starves cancer cell formation, regulates inflammation.
						REL animals fast- when they are sick! instinctive action to Reduce stress for fight off infection.
					Skin and acne
						as regeneration from conserved energy.
					Excretory system
						not eating for 1 day- help clean up toxins and regulate functioning of other organs.
				experience hunger- hormones regulated (obese stop receive correct signals)-> full quicker.
					burn through fat cells
					improves insulin sensitivity
					helps prevent binge eating- ok to skip a meal.
				Self enlightenment- 
					connected to life during the practices reading, meditation, yoga and martial arts
					more energy in the body cuz digestive consumes huge energy.
					lighter body and clearer mind- for awareness and gratitude.
			Cutting carbs benefits
				other health benefits- life saving effects in type2 diabetics.
				kill appetite in good way
				abdominal fat loss
				Heart health
					reduces triglycerides (vs low fat inc triglycerides in cases)
					Inc HDL (lipoproteins that carry cholesterol to liver- for reuse or excretion vs vv)
				reduced blood suger and insulin levels
					Because high blood sugars are toxic, the body responds with a hormone called insulin, 
					insulin tells the cells to bring the glucose into the cells and to start burning or storing
					quick insulin in healthy minimize the spike vs insulin resistance (cells don't see it)
					type2- not enough insulin. cure- reducing insulin dosage by 50%
					beware of hypoglycemia if on medication to lower it.
				red High BP (hypertension) -> Reduced heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, etc.
				some brain parts need only glucose then liver produces glucose out of protein if we don�t eat any carbs.
				others can burn ketones.
			<Health>
				Nap for 10-20 mins or 90 mins (sleep cycle)
					caffeine is not best solution- freaking magical- slugs 
					lowers risk of heart disease. better memory.
					stage 3 to 4- your brain hates it.
					1- light and limbo. 2- real sleep, body temp drops, 3- muscle relax and deep sleep and REM.
					which stage you wake up. Not more than 40 mins.
				Oxytocin reverses cortisol release. 
					mother infant relp- inc in hormone- greater bonding and love and vv.
					inhibits stress response (dec stress hormone (cortisol))- relaxes and calms- contentment, belonging, safety, well being.
					give oxytocin to ppl- it will behave- sniff it.
					Touch does that naturally- licking, grooming, humans touch (stroking, kiss, skin touch), massaging.

                                If ORT ain't a big deal, then priority queue by priority (Very High vs high) then MPT date then ORT date.
                                that way we don't promise FCFS.
                                if you hold earliest response algorithm, then shortest job should be the approach.
                                we are driven by priority, not SJF or FCFS - this is sign of health.
                                what about being fair - any algorithm you take it's not fair - you think FCFS is fair - what if first arrival chokes all other processes
                                        SJF - longer job will keep waiting. Anything but priority queue - may mean endless wait for others. RR - you know all the issues but finished none cuz of context switching time being huge. Thinking about it - for e1, the healthiest algorithm is priority queue.
                                        FCFS + RR is what I have been doing with context switch guaranteed after 1 day. But that ain't very healthy.
                                        what about high priority choking lower priority - well at some stage the job changes its priority cuz of wait. Some endless wait avoided.
                                        idk, this conclusion is very natural to people and should have come naturally to me as well.
                                                cuz of being self centeredness to avoid troubles or looking for enhanced gratification - this may not be mature best but here it is.
                                ORT is support colleague's business and none of developer's we just comply with the timelines so that we have an update by the regular ORT.
                                        if update ain't there, give whatever update or not, support needs to worry with updating customer.
                                        else do you realize the problem, customer can end up not getting updated at all.
                                        our criteria is based on priority and MPT and not so much on ORT.
                        Health - do it uslf no matter how much time it takes (the time will keep reducing from then on)
                        help from others should only be in terms of approach or step that you are missing. 
                                If they import your problem stop them and ask them for specific work else it affects our growth.
                                But if the threshold of time is exceeding then let them import the problem but not otherwise.

                        Health - Having ecosystem for PIES is healthy - standardizing those fun and health of the others wrt to that is healthy.
                        Friends create an ecosystem for PIES - there are always seniors, equals and juniors in the pursuits of PIES.
                        The amount of time dedicated to them is proportional to your own plans but I is generally heavier than E and so forth.
                        Health - Fast reader. Curiousity settled in a few days in and out.
                        Health - Driven by intrinsic motivators gives you stability. Extrinsic motivators keep you on a run cuz of what's better than where you are.
                        so compromise on economical reality of life - you should be paid for the service that it is worth and bidding determines its worth.
                        So what we need is balance - for desire of more worth for your services, you may keep endlessly keep pushing yourself which is very good 
                                but not when it comes at the cost of PIES health 
                                it goes to MOP instead of MOG and the realm that you are in, you rock within that - enjoy within that but deprive yourself of higher possibilities.
                        So, idea of economics is not more money, but best monetary worth for your services not quantity of services themselves rather quality.
                                Quantity enough that it does not start sucking PIES and at least, that it is enjoyable.
                                iow, what you do in your regular 8 hrs of IQ Projects is very valuable. iow, increase your value per unit time of effort on a project.

                                                You don't need approval from anyone but yourself- anyone likes that (boy or girl)
                                                all that matters is what you think of yourself.
                                            it's a personal and spiritual journey and effects are outcomes (not done for them)

                                            Sacred Sexuality- Nature's way- Dignity of human dimension to it. ?Act of becoming one- thereby getting ready for the child.
                                                Sex becoming an expression of love vs sensual craving satiated by 7 (we won't mind replacing the other person)
                                                I never picture my idealism there- what I hated from myself once, I got escalation to like it.
                                            Porn- 
                                                no dignity when the human dimension is eliminated from the person
                                                    not that it shows too much of the person, but that it shows far too little.
                                                Who are vendors of Porn? human trafficking- many are caught up here cuz of demand, force or greed.
                                                    Spoiling lives of people, workers and the gonna be children.
                                                    even softcore users soon get addicted to hardcore- dopamine makes sure that happens.
                                                    People get more averse to spiritual dimension of life- the very goal of being.
                                                    Porn stars are drug users like meth- spoiling their lives, viewers' lives, haploid cell lives, your life
                                                    Our demand supports the supply.
                                                who are clients of porn? ppl who are chicken to social life and will agree on cheap access.
                                                    cuz of lack of self worth. Imagining self on screen.
                                                    iow, Porn is what we wish in real life but could not manage- imagine how ugly!
                                                    more aggressive and on face than real life.

                                                1 ounce of gold is more beautiful than 1000 ounce of lead.
                                                confront the realities- tolerate them, accept them, cherish them.
                                                don't fall on the trap of insecurity that porn industry captures you in.
                                        social anxiety
                                            drained of emotions, willingness to bond => Self Obsessed, Choose to be a loner, no real life gf => Reduced intimacy with partners (devaluation; ED, Premature ejaculation, delayed ejac)
                                            It's like avoiding pain without which no1 grows!!
                                            Real time problems- can't crave cuz brain trained differently
                                                not on screen, no novelty (compare to best in world and rejecting)
                                                Oxytocin vs dopamine- porn can't love you back. Reduced intimacy with partners.

                                                started liking it- social probs developed after that.
                                                made me extremely introverted and became a loner
                                                90s with High speed internet ppl said they had probs, 2008 when ppl started asking for help. 
                                        Physical
                                            Dark circles around the eyes get worse and eyes look tired.
                                                cause of dark circles- sedation (depressants) and facial flushing (redness).
                                            TT father- you look so good and fresh even after 30 hrs awake.
                                                b4 ppl- told about 'spark' in the eye.
                                                2 days later- fell- son.. you look like shit. and other such times.
                                                    "seems like you're a ghost son, what happened to you?"
                                                        I didn't feel bad but It did make me feel like zombie again.
                                                Decide- how you want to appear to others the next day: bright and with shining eyes or like a sedated pile of shit.                                
                                            crouched posture and dull eyes I observe.
                                            More porn > more anxiety > more lazyness > struggle doing simple things > more boredom.

                                                Brain fog- dark clouds on your head. Can't work with a challenge with cool head.
                                            Feeling
                                                ?you will be back to same prob? same mcq!
                                                you want to feel like shit again?
                                                2 sec pleasure and lasting regret!

                                                getting up back is not a trivial process.
                                                lost motivation- high of dopamine.
                                            Addiction
                                                Dopamine buzzing on your neurons; mimics brain of drug user like coccaine.
                                                    supernormal stimulating to your brain- pleasure molecule -> reward -> go get it.
                                                        brain tells u to get more and increase level, severity or kind for high
                                                            numbed gratification for little pleasures -> Lost motivation
                                                                dependent on it for normal functioning- addiction related brain changes.
                                                                in other words, sentisization (oh man- gotta have it, thought presentation)
                                                            Brain Plasticity- (Delta FOS-B)Rewiring of your brain- picky- more susceptible (wretched nervous system)
                                                                but hedonic adaptation- escalated to more shocking material and withdrawl symptoms.
                                                                iow, desentisization- getting used to. overstimulation of reward pathway
                                                                    regular things don't give a kick- icecream with friend, being in beaching, enjoying sun.
                                                            at that time I didn't see it- cuz blind to it- but on retrospect.
                                                                Hypofrontality- brain part goes- prefrontal cortex- intelligence - this, this this.
                                                                    any addiction- will power is eroded. difficult to think clearly. programmed to want that.
                                                                Dysfunctional stress circuit- sugar stoppage, probs with food on stress.
                                                                    brain wired to seek and satisfy addiction under stress intense urge to soothe.
                                                    withdrawl symptoms- stress, anxiety related (social anxiety), insomnia, concentration, irritable, lethargic (flatline)
                                                        anxiety- eyes on me. ppl complained- brain prob  
                                                            genitals' color change. evokes reward circuitry (towards same prob)
                                                            adults get recovered faster cuz of maturity; youth cuz of lesser damage.
                                                There is no such thing- moral agenda they believe so pathologizing- awareness of potential negative effects.
                                                    so they have preconceived notions.

                                I would choose healthier lifestyle - 
                                    Spirituality - I want to live continence. OR I want to live on Brahman (Brahmacharya)
                                    Not a burst of expression but channelized needs for stable mind.
                                    viz
                                        Friday Night Entertainment - blockbuster movie (decide your criteria)
                                        1 Game per week is a must - you decide indoor or outdoor.
                                        Value current relationships - take initiatives not just acceptance.
                        </Discrimination>
                        <Determination> what will you do so that determination to take up the challenge shoots up.
                            Role Models. Listening to successful people. Affirmations. Like minded people.
                            Understand that it makes me grow in Brahmacarya- every decision that will take me to brahman- like road to brahman.
                            2. Increase reading and hearing (free time, improve ur discrimination)- motivation for dharma, kartavya.

                                    1. Read glories of brahmacarya (to be convinced that this is what u want and vv)
                            Chanting- Living in brahman.
                            It is a lifestyle change (diffn outlooks, pursuits)
                                Not that I don't want to do this- but I want to do THAT (spiritual, ego, life experience) which is more important to me.
                                A more painless (and potentially effective) alternative to attacking your addiction is to grow out of it
                            "Attacking" your addiction and focusing on "beating" it will trigger withdrawal and make your addiction more difficult to overcome.

                            Aesthetically appealing (Godsent- so follow the plan) no doubt but at what cost.
                                it has ALWAYS left me broken-hearted. It has given me nightmares in past by making me lethargic.
                                Escapism will make achieving process complicated only.
                                    Since you never face the problems head-on they continue to remain!! It's time face it man- I can take it!!
                                In the womb of enjoyment lies the embryo of misery.
                                Personal Ideology- Compromising (forgoing) Integrity gives tremendous pain.
                                "Trouble yourself how long"
                                    Not force- it's natural. It's not a day but a lifetime chosen (by experience)
                                        not supposed to do but like to.
                                        It's a thought away- but why 1 pure day- it becomes lifestyle automatically.
                                        fall down is a streak of wrong actions- not 1.
                                Is that taking me where I will like to see myself down the line or away!!
                            VS
                            Believe in yourself- I can do it.
                                climbing everest seems impossible but 1 step at a time!
                                don't look down, don't look up - just climb!
                                I will be on the same MCQ some time later if I choose wrong option- it has already taken lifetimes.
                            I am getting closer to brahman with every day!

                        <Determination>
                            Visualize self in roles of hanuman, Modi, RNSM, etc. Who are my idols?
                            Imagine all the guidance I can give to people on NFP and devs.
                            If on, 
                                Allowing little highs- cheating yourself.
                                    no excuses.
                                    brain starts to heal- seems like lost interest but no idle curiosity (play with fire- it enters as needle leaves as plow)
                                        Not feeling effects cuz You are so used to being awesome and you want to spice it up.
                                    Don't mistake distraction with solution
                                Cold showers- kill urges. Get u awake.
                                Pranayam calms the mind.
                            Feeling substitutes which are less severe.
                            Inspiration
                                Read success stories and past experiences.
                                    relief to see others and hope that they recovered.
                                    trust your fellow fapstronauts and you'll get there soon.
                                Many benefits seen- but long way ahead of me- still have to change a lot of things, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
                                    in beginning, you may feel like not getting better, but you are, walk through the fire. You'll fail and think it is impossible, show yourself you can do it.

                            Better think projects head on than escaping them.
                            Let's think spiritual matters now- hear a lecture!
                            BG declares that it's contemplation on SO thru contact or sanskar, triggers it.

                                public internet access.
                                Pick a phone- make a phone call (organize your contacts)
                                        hang out with someone
                                Give alternate thinking- ToDo List for mind, etc!! Eat a dish outside.
                            Make arranging for all necessary situ difficult (intellectual leap, karmendriya leap, jnanendriya support)
                                Eg- Avoiding laptop in solitude, etc.
                            Thinking substitutes- Being busy with projects.
                                I would rather choose substitutes that are more rewarding in long run (shreyas)
                                Some projects and funs that I had written down for free time- it's time to do them!!
                                Talk someone dear to you.
                            If turned on, go out for a demanding running or gym session

                            Busy with projects.
                            If there
                                Complaining- I could have not wasted my time (what's the lesson?, that's it)
                                    even fake smile makes you feel better.
                                    replace negative with positive. Traffic jam? time for music!!
                                    why upset if can't change it and vv.

                        It's a biological punishment to carry on with ourselves : testosterone+ testicles
                                It's a heavenly reward to walk with all resources and knowing when to use what!!
                                You are the master of senses, mind, intellect, ego - we gotta act like one !!
                                Testosterone has a range of rewards
                                involved in health and well-being
                                prevention of osteoporosis
                                increased muscle and bone mass
                                boosts confidence - Lack of it gives depression
                                Nature bestows any features upon us - those features bring a score of opportunities and responsibilities with them
                                Inability to handle the power, doesn't make the power bad.
                                Testicles produce sperms which brings forth life on planet. A miracle !!
                                Testosterone helps metabolism and helps avoid fat
                                Problem is we tend to take these organs in enjoyment spirit and not respecting them as integral member of organ family.
                                They have a lot to contribute to the body and life in general
                                Testosterone elicits behavior to stand against oppression!
                                Yes, Testosterone brings benefits on table that other hormones don't. Of course, females have their own advantages and functions, responsibilities (that nature brings them) and their bodies are custom fit for their roles. They can either hate their bodies or love them.

                	How to stay Ultra inspired
				Any great leader has high inspiration.
				strategy and execution is 1 thing but great leaders were Inspiration for purpose
				protect your inspirations
				1. importance of ciculation- office hours- st outside. circulating thru world- new ppl, cities- inspiration-
					eg- uber driver- why in diffn city- what's culture of other place. family. He said he didn't like but make money- newer insights (case studies, analogies)
				2. walk in nature- listen audiobook, meditations, gratitude points 50- thanking earth.
					dopamine, cortisol reduce, immune system.
				3. watching sunset- taken for granted cuz often- hedonic adaptation.
					brains hardwired for ingratitude- what's wrong- lest tiger doesn't eat us.
					these things matter more than toys of name, fame.
				4. connect with loved ones- what's most important to you in life- family.
				5. write journal- the I am 25- I am _____ (write 25 times)
					humble, brave, smart, loving, innovative, energetic
					creates a blueprint in the mind.
			From a job to craft (IQ)
				spread carpets like lady gaga sings songs.
				impact of your work linger in their mind- they become brand ambassador on social media.
					let my work touch most people.
				OAD- obsessive attention to detail.
				never lose spark in the eye- go extra mile.
				get your role models brain tattooed.
				give you promotion, self respect, etc
				such good lessons that really influence others- lead to recursion of change is society.
				1. brain perception of dignity of labor- Toilet cleaner"wlc to my office"
					every work is a chance for us to lift other human beings, transcend myself (fears)
					shoemaker, watchmaker- get mentors, apprenticeship- study minutest of detail.
				2. optimization (update the software)- make UI better, culture better
					every day's tiny improvement makes a giant/ tsunami of results.
				3. current stage of progress- if I stick to them I won't grow. 
					take things 1 step ahead.
				4. being imaginative- hang out with teens, startups, biz ppl, yoga teachers, strangers- have guts to talk.
					going to conferences, constantly reading -> mindset -> behavior -> lead.
				5. commit to obsession- I should be knowing the field more than anyone.
					they should cry seeing the impact of my work.
					monomeniacally obsessed with it- BIW (Best in the world)
			Importance of becoming famous (IQ)
				misnomer- it is what you become in the process that matters.
					innovation, bravery, endeavor, perseverence, inner power
					vs money, fame toys.
				impact so much that you don't have to introduce yourself- cuz your work matters to them.
				1. craft above ego- michael angelo of your craft. Eb will want your product.
				2. Quality over market- may do many ads but quality of product sucks (no1)
					make UI beautiful. The positively affected ppl will become your brand ambassador.
				3. Art over brand- Go to your workplace/labs/office to do your art (code like picasso painted)
					study the master of the art.
			
			Making a team of picassos
				coming from heart- hired, let go off,, encouraged, knocked down by/for employees.
				1. 1 from 1000 insight- if we try 20 ppl to choose 1, we may not have the absolute best.
					merchants of "wow" are only few.
					so hire a lot to find the best.
				2. Hire on mindset not history- steve Jobs would personally monitor.
					check compatibility with core values, beliefs for Sharing vision (eg- OAD- Obsessive attention to detail)
					eg- without generosity of giving you will not fit with us
					sb comes sees performance of our team- it would blow their minds.
				3. Do deep rigor- Joke- job interview is meeting of 2 liers- both trying to appease (what other person wants to hear)
					of course, in 1 sense, both are honest.
					having a meal with the person maybe a good idea- you can tell if they are messy.
				4. You can't have an A level company with C level performers
				How to keep picassos
				1. be all about growing- incentives money is around 6th,7th.
					amongst most important ones are being in place they have a sense of belonging.
					a place that challenges them.
					Be like a coach of a great team- push them, devp them, challenge them, encourage them
						they may not always like that but in long run, or in heart, they will respect it.
				2. Encourage your team- 
					respect them- nobody wants to be around egotist.
					toxic leaders vs being an eg- punctual
				3. break bread with the team- army that feeds together win together.
					Nepolean lost only 1 battle- in which army was not fed.
			
			Uncommon practices to become a genius communicator
				Conversation you are resisting the most is the one you need.
				We are afraid of speaking- fear of being ridiculed, failing, losing relp, being weird.
				Successful ppl- speak up and share their truth.
					speaking up when you should gives you power.
				when you swallow it- impoliteness of a waiter, sth inhumane (spoiling dignity of being human) around road
					makes you impotent as a leader.
					we give power to things we ignore.
				have guts to speak up when voice is shaking.
					pick up difficult conversation
				1. listen deeply first- many ppl use physical cues- placing fingers on lips.
					this honors the other person (given your attention)- even with your children.
					great teams listens to their employees.
				2. you can say anything you want so long as you say it with respect-
					7 rude at coffee shop, 7 comes late for an appointment
					why are you late- I am angry- they feel attacked- puts them into defense mode- nothing achieved.
					vs "b4 we enjoy this wonderful meal- I want to share sth with respect- punctuality is very important to me. I have been waiting for about 30 mins
					and I will be grateful if you respect my time as much as I want to respect yours."
					genuine humans will respect the second.
				3. be clear- we dance around the issues. Be clear.
					give eg.
				4. Let it go- go to the next level of the day with no brooding.
					brooding over past doesn't let you build the future.
                        Reflections
                                yes man attitude - vs conditional attitude
                                        eg - are you free - no - can i assign you tickets - yes vs yes, soon after reading my mails I can work on them.
                                be alert and no blind trust (blind trust in god is not ok, eth else is?)
                                        implicit trust in another - 7 punctures - some of which I didn't check - nth stops the mechanic to sneak a new sign there.
                                                before getting a puncture ask for rates per puncture (more of an advantage with tubeless that you can choose vendor)
                                                pay close attention that mechanic doesn't sneak any new hole.
                                                seek some bargain after it's all over with mild try - to be done in fun.
                                                all of this has to be done with amicable attitude and fun - because you know how shit works.
                                                room to another guy given - bedsheet torn more, detergent used; none of these are big things but the principle is important - self love
                                                consider a situation where you give bike - there are minor punctures which don't deflate the bike; who pays for them - you are more mindful with your bike
                                        didn't check the jeans after it was being tailored by the seller.
                                                lesson - never put implicit trust anywhere
                                                what to do - ask seller to do something for you in prob.
                                                        if nothing can be done with jeans, ask for refund.
                                                        if full not possible, ask for half cuz jeans becomes worthless to you.
                                                        or hold this as a reminder when you visit them next time to get a favor in some form (Future rebate)
                                        atm slided with 200 bucks instead of 160.
                        So strange that ppl always hunt for reasons to be pissed and don't hunt for reasons to be grateful about.
                            some things are tolerate or accept. For some there is an actionable insight- then it's good.
                        EQ - Knowledge of all areas (knowledge discussion for enrichment)
                                D - initiate discussion on sth that triggered emotions (basically replayed association with an emotion)
                                        talk sth relevant. Not a must but preferably, interesting to the other person.
                        EQ
                                Process and Data Models - help you with standardizations of all layers. at beck and call when needed.
                                Projects (personal or others' - news) - create gratification of that layer (emotions for EQ layer specifically)
                                        Eg - somebody's novel - emotions thru his journey; contents - or being a consumer of 7's work, triggers different emotions.
                        EQ - Fun, Healthy other layers
                        EQ - Home Buying
                                your home salary - take 40% as EMI and multiply is by 10. That's the total EMI you should be willing to take loan of.
                                decide based on current money status how much down payment you can make right now.
                                Eg - say you earn 60K per month - 24K EMI is ok with you * 100 - 24 Lakhs loan can be taken (payable in 8-9 years)
                                earlier you decide the better. Your affordability depending on loan amount + down payment.
                                Incomplete house - payment based on checkpoints of completion - floor made, interiors, painting, etc.
                                        by the last part of work, 80% payment is already done. So builders generally become slow at doing those and reinvest their money somewhere else.
                                        so last part of completion takes some time - which buyer gotta tolerate and gotta do consumer court case if really hurt - like dates for registrati
                        EQ - Most of the cases, I find the problem is not the struggle with people's anarthas but misunderstanding and communication gaps.
                                only solution to this is communication and resolve the matter like adults. Empathy - put yourself in other's shoes and give them benefit of doubt.
                                Not that people don't have anarthas but most of them, align themselves with flexibility given to them by nature.
                                If something needs discussion, just face it even if it seems cheap cuz it is bothering you as a matter of fact.
                                Eg - being sure he is not adding fruits under veggies. May seem like cheap discussion matter of hundreds but cumulation is undesirable and if at all, the behavior ain't cool.
                        EQ - Music
                                Sounds with increasing pitch -

                        EQ - when experiments start small - like buying new colored under-shirt, try it with 1 and then extend it - first POC then scrum time.
                        EQ - Persuasion - like other things it is gradient descent of practice.
                                about - also includes self-persuasion.
                                Senses - promised disconnected reward of entertainment or objects. (Daam, Dand in disconnect)
                                Mind - Make yourself or them say that's what they want thru emotions. (Daam, Dand head-on)

                                Ego - Saam - comparisons with others. I/ You believe in it.
                                Soul - bigger than myself (my identity or ego)
                                Supersoul - Instrict. 6th sense. Purified person can use that. Power of ethics, moral (more than worldly moral - coming from the source of our essence)

                                Supersoul - Devs.
                        EQ - There ain't no extrovert and introvert 
                                it's just your perspective towards socializing. 
                                If you are unwilling to pay the price for EQ communications you lose on something - maybe cuz you have something more valuable. but threshold has to be crossed. 
                                People start rationalising their behavior in terms of they have this ego - a better way of putting would be you choose it for whatever reasons. 
                                It's not ability to communicate effectively that caused probs for you in past
                                        but too big a leap resembling imitation of some behavior which didn't reward you as you might have expected.
                                        or maybe you are unwilling to pay the price. OR that you acted in ways that are against your beliefs just cuz others are doing it 
                                        that doesn't invalidate communications but being authentically evolving on the path of communications.
                        EQ - Discussion Topics
                                Person News to Ego based Institutional Hierarchies News 
                                        what binds us together. OR that other person may have interest in.
                                        Deviation permitted at every level of discussion - eg at person level there can be discussion about car you recently drove but since not center of attraction - this ain't a persistent topic of discussion and may not go very deep.
                                        Eg - News about Self, Stories or Techs, features or Roles, Product or LoB, SAP, ERP or Software Field, CS Life, corporate world, VA, etc.
                                        Another Eg - News about self, Residence locality, city, state, direction like south area, country, continent, earth, universe, etc.
                                        Eg - the other day discussion started off on GDPR which is a feature inside to how GDPR is growing concern in EU and for other products. 
                                                sometimes discussion is on future of LOB or work life balance cuz of scrum planning ways.
                                Discussion can be concern topics, need topics (curious about state of art, news or road ahead), interest topics (fun around the known)
                                        just having jokes around the ways things are happening. Discussing plus and minus of the things.
                        EQ - State vs country vs nation
                                The NOAD reports the following definitions for those words.
                                state: a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government
                                nation: a large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory
                                country: a nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory
                                The difference between nation and country is that country refers to the people, the territory, and the government, while nation refers to the people, and the territory. In the case of federal countries (e.g., USA, Austalia, Germany) a state is just a part of the country; in the other countries (e.g., Italy, France), the state coexists with the country.

                                        yours and others - identify it 
                                        Eg - holidays - where spend time
                                        Objectives - they want to feel validated.
                                                empathy - see it from their perspective. understand their world and temperament and then deal with it.
                                                        even directly asking - I wanna know what you want.
                                                        seriously consider how you can propose something that they want which also satisfies your self interest.

                                        speak to president - you are like good company. Great training for me and bummer to train another person. Suggestions - maybe I can move to NY or leave and come back to train new hire. He suggested he could make him a contracter.
                                Avoids
                                        To not bluff, don't be bitter about it (but ok with no deal option).
                                        Never screw the other person. Let me get 80% share of 100 units but make a new pie of 150 units.
                        EQ - Verbal Arguments - (not conflicts based on world view based)
                                about - people's egos are tied to their arguments
                                Socrate's method
                                        try to understand people's position as best as you can.
                                        frame your disagreements in the form of questions - a chance to respond without being cornered and much less likely to be offended.
                                Empathy
                                ask questions or smart assertions - instead of making statements - less provocative.
                                        try to state back to them their own beliefs in your words - so you are saying that...
                                        so do bad things cancel out each other.
                                        even assertions as "yes, but..."
                                Lighten up
                                        Joke on demand to change the mood - the ability to crack joke - I am on the same side as you.
                                                as simple as misinterpreting a word.
                                                typically they want to demonize one another - saying but you are the good ones.
                                                also willing to take the joke.
                                        sub-communicate that he is not there for fight. Eg - angry - and there is so much more that you can say.
                                                raise voice, speak vast - slow things down. Eg - when I grew up (or take deep breathe)
                                                upward inflections are not bad but excellent for de-escalating conflict - reassures them that you are not commanding or controlling them which upsets them in first place.
                                Mindset
                                        In every arguments you are not necessarily right.
                                        Adjusting your beliefs, doesn't diminish you. Don't just be right but get it right.
                                        they are not evil but cuz somehow ignorant. Dialogue can help only if we don't hit their ego.
                                        eg - I don't want to destroy you but engage with you. Test your ideas with those that don't sink in with - helpful to come to right.
                        EQ - Stay Cool
                                Practice - face less challenging scenarios that threatens you. like mock interview.
                                        say an extra sentence helps in long run - challenges you without panic.
                        EQ - Smartness
                                turn trash to resources - lemon to lemonades.
                                        make most out of a situation - assasination attempt => possibility of misinformation of it being successful.
                                        bad things appear bad only in particular context - change the context and they will be and not just appear good.
                        EQ - Joke - cool like cucumber.
                        EQ - Break the flow (difficult) - ask a state breaking question to steer it in new direction.
                                Not every question needs an answer - people can't use it against you.
                                what makes you hate yourself - is it red shoes cuz they fking red.
                        EQ - life is oscillation between fear and greed (for ordinary people)
                                both these extremes are very unhealthy for spiritual life.
                                We want shortcuts to success or benefits. Spiritual life doesn't approve of this approach.
                                Even hoping a point (instead of a range) of MOG (balance between MOP and MOI) is also not the idea but a degree of deviation from standard mean as per time, place and circumstance.
                                We are accepting towards others anarthas and tolerant towards our own 
                                        intolerance won't help you - accepting current position and working towards the goal is the point
                                Be calculative and wary of anarthas in people - feel free to expose them.
                                Eg - 7 rounding off 8 to 0 instead of 10 - ask how much is it - he would say 8 - you smirk a little and accept it - this is sufficient training for a day for him.
                                all cheating takes place in pursuit of greed. You take a leap of faith in greed of great returns and they bite your bossoms for that leap.
                                        if you are looking for a quick reward for which you have not paid the due price - that's unfavorable for Krishna consciousness.
                                        in emails congrats you won, in matrimonial with people from countries you appreciate some aspects about, in buying cars, etc.
                                        Remember I said to VAP that if I don't deserve it, please don't select me.
                                How is it different from leap of faith in spirituality 
                                        that leap is based on past experiences and you really make yourself a little vulnerable for that leap so the leap should ideally be step by step to be sustainable anyway.
                                        1 huge leap may give you some awesome experience but that state since is not a natural state won't last.
                                In pursuit of success, failure is a person's best friend.
                                Krishna has designed that anarthas are very rewarding in short term but in long run they cause trouble - suffering in the womb of enjoyment.
                        EQ - High cost culture => High results.

                            experiences shatter us- make us shatter in past.

                            How to forgive a human being
                                Go thru life, we get hurt (we do our best)
                                        e1 is.
                                they do what's best as per where they are in their journey of life.
                                        forgiving them is what they deserve but gift to yourself.
                                1. Feel vs Repress- 7 is dishonest- 
                                        ppl escape. Don't feel feeling- you press it in subconscious (you will act on projection)
                                            all pains is still within you.
                                            Strained glass window- you see world by your filter- pain, anger, shame, guilt repressed.
                                                Not present moment you see.
                                        Feel the feeling- thru writing in journal, share with close friend, go to woods and talk it.
                                                clear emotionally and intellectually.
                                2. Benefit of Doubt- Understand vs judge- Don't judge someone.
                                        He's bad- it's a label- why not try to understand (may be traffic cutter was rushing to hospital)
                                                maybe lost dear one.
                                        E1 alive today- act as per personal reality- cuz you behaved certain way- they have created their own narrative.
                                                about world is working- and you in that trap.
                                                You were doing sth that they felt as attack.
                                3. Speak Up- Communicate vs condone- speak up. don't condone.
                                        speak your truth even when your voice shakes.
                                        this is how I felt.
                                        Results in-
                                            builds intimacy (rectification, explanation of behavior)
                                            don't understand and feel upset- might not have been person we want in life.
                                4. Release vs Repress- Present is where miracles live.
                                        He could be a person of certain nature, what am I doing now about it?
                                        Let go! Accept it!
                                        In sadness of past, present can't thrive.

                            What am I giving to a relp than what it is giving to me (choose relp instance to your interest)
                            All layers lower to soul are means to express it.
                            these are not discrete, in fact, follow layered approach, 1 on top encompasses the ones in lower layer.

                                Contextual jokes- or straight away jokes. Or fun outta situ.

                                    Remember their or your life changing moments- their role, response,etc.
                                    You talk different stuffs and mental similarities are explored.
                                            have fun together. Talk about stuffs and lose track of time.
                                    Gratification together- delicious meals (jnanedriyas), appealing movies.
                                    Having fun- talk what they want
                                            Share stories. Pastimes, qualities.
                                            Being genuinely interested in their lives (remember their details- for reference and utility)

                                            substantiate your point with your own life or others' life.
                                        ask about other persons all details PIES.
                                            get into all subjects- psychology, etc.
                                    Jokes are good utilities in some pursuit- blind gunning not bad.
                                    Empathy- 
                                        Eg in formal- Empathy- towards shopkeeper- so much heat, how you bear, get some shade. Juice banakar pi lete honge!

                        Eye Contact, Body Language surface Level aspects of Charisma but they orignate from a mindset! So, step backwards, focus on what underpins cuz focus on all externals while in conversation is difficult.

                            Ppl live in "what if" loop questions- 
                                But repercussions are not that serious- we recover.
                                    Not extend to jumping from 40 storey building but relationships!!
                                1. What if boss doesn't like idea.
                                    Fine! Move on!
                                2. Ask a friend for date and she refuses.
                                    Certainly better than spending 6 months of futile thoughts.
                                3. Friend for coffee and he says busy.
                            Gives you freedom to crack jokes, express ideas/ feelings, ask people- you can risk more than others.
                                Ppl see this immunity to social pressure- expressing what you are more. They will gravite towards you.
                                    cuz e1 wants to have this in him/her.

                                They will think this.
                                What if I do this.
                                They won't believe me if I...

                                let people form their opinions!
                                People see that you are not overly invested in controlling how they feel- they go"I can trust them to be genuine"
                                    kinda paradoxical- but people will have better opinions for you.

                        I have impeccable honesty and integrity.
                            Needs to be emphasized more in society!
                            When you tell a lie, or little, little lie- "I am on my way" or big lie- that can ruin relationship.
                            Even if not caught or no repercussions, you build a reputation with yourself that you can lie (st you are not to be believed (trustworthy))
                            Affects the conviction with which you can say things.
                                Look in someone's eye and say- I believe a 100% what comes outta my mouth. I take full stand of myself.
                                You know yourself!!
                            Penalty pay comes with it- convenient lies that pay off! It hurts when it's gone.
                                Do it anyway even if damaging to that relationship. self-esteem crushed and relp will not be genuine.
                                Not that insanely- on someone's death bed, you say- I don't believe in God.
                        Pretension is lack of integrity/honesty (satya)
                            Honesty is words don't say action. Integrity is action doesn't say words
                            when vision (bhakti), thoughts (Dhyan), words (relp), actions (karma) are not in sync
                            I pretend 7's informal pal- but state of mind says formal- other disapproves of it.

                            Contradiction- how to make people do what u want them to do.
                                you learn- make asks more pursuasive- increasing odds that someone do what u want them to do (they will want to do)
                            We want relp objects to behave a certain way.
                                Eg- Boss, girl, family should behave a certain way.
                                -> You get into neediness, Charisma is destroyed
                                    he asks
                                    yes? great!
                                    No? figure out! 
                                        Can I deal with a person in a way acceptable to me
                                        Or filter this person/ relp out.
                                Someone not treating you the way you like to be treated.
                                    Repetetive battle of forcing them to force them to be what they don't
                                    Accept it or filter out!- when you start filtering those peripheral relationships.

                            Charismatic ppl have a purpose, they are fired up by.
                                in communication, they share what their purpose is.
                                Burried life episode, bucket list of playing basketball with obama.
                                    walked around washington DC door to door and asked if people could help them in their intent.
                                    Months later Obama sees on MTV- invites them and they get to play.
                                    Other people hear and help them out in some way (not universe!)

                            Be first to extend praise that are not very comfortable doing that.
                            Be first in a strangers' group to crack a joke or start a converstation.
                                You crack a joke, other gets comfortable and he cracks- whole group dynamics has changed.
                            Taking ppl to areas where you can connect more- having fun, extending praise, being vulnerable- signify leadership, bravery.
                                other ppl are nervous to do these, they will want to be with you more.
                                Someone opens up and shares life story and things start to grow (connecting at level previously NA, absent)
                                Ppl remember who started and makes them endearing- they took social risk (be the one to take social risk!)

                            Gym for Charisma, EQ, IQ, etc?
                                Take initiative
                                7 puts threat- Martial arts
                                Experiment and learn
                                1. Improv Comedy- being funny in front of strangers is terrifying (pushes comfort zone)
                                        Otherwise, people run out of topics to talk about.
                                        Nth to go off. Audience shouts and you've to riff off. Not just stage but everywhere it happens (7 gives you conversational threat, riff on that and continue(even when they stall))
                                2. Toastmasters- nationwide- chapters ew- help people public speak. We are talking best speak- promotion,etc- but e1 there to learn.
                                        Struggling vs 7 in audience says filler words you do (no of times)
                                        Wednesday lunch hours.
                                3. Martial Arts- 7 in your face, conflict; heart palpitates and how to respond. Not that you punch them b4 even talking.
                                        7 trying to hit you, choking you- rapid heart beat, adrenaline rushes, breath thru it and plan forward.
                                        It becomes easy to face situ where the stakes are just social.
                                4. Experimenting with first impressions- Any night event- boring story, fact about yourself, (not that you are gonna be in bathroom so forth), first 2 mins, they excuse themselves
                                        Real time feedback, what is interesting to stranger and what's boring.
                                        Pay attention to this- split test- talk different stuffs and see response. Ppl fascinated by my interesting jobs or my passion.
                                        Whenever leave the event- check what worked and what didn't- what was difference. clear head with docs.

                            How to be pursuasive- Barack Obama
                            to change people (not ew- filter them out or keep positive ones that lift you up)
                                    Against obstinacy
                                            Experience the pain of others thru your expressions.
                                                   Our thoughts and prayers are not enough.
                                                   got to future uncertainity- they may attack any city of USA again.
                                                   This has become routine and my responses have become routine.

                                            1. Illustrate Problem and associate pain to it
                                            "This Sucks"- 1st make them associate current status quo- current action or inaction- with serious pain.
                                                    before going ahead on how beautiful it will be if this is done.
                                            2. Propose a solution/plan consistent with type of person they are and want to be.
                                                We want to propose sth consistent with their current identity- can't ask for massive changes (they will resist)
                                                    "Resposible gun owners"- they will agree on this (all gun owners on his side)
                                                    Extension of their current value system and not a deviation.
                                            3. Preemptively deal with any objections you have researched (your audience has)
                                            Put yourself in others' shoes and answer their objections first (and yourself)
                                                    "Whatever their motivations are"- making apparent that their political motivations are hinderance to your good work.
                                            4. Prestige Issue- Make people feel that it is part of their identity to do those things (you are telling them)
                                                    not thru being preachy.
                                                    give them ownership of these arguments- I am not telling you- media will go loop the numbers.

                        If there's a clash of interests, then there's competition and the best should proceed.
                        1 way out is to not even compete- and accept the natural denial of rewards and possibilities (which is ok if it fits your vision but it's not if it challenges it)
                                eg- I won't give ppt and accept other person getting your quota of kudos.

                                                    Respected- is flattery (obsequous, not condescend)- but is acceptance- not offensive.
                                                    Hello/ Hi is casual expression- seniors may get offended.

                                                            It's not wrong but may be taken wrongly.
                                                    Use titles (of accolades, not names)- Sir, Prof, Dr, Sir/Madam (gender neutral)

                    <Informal>Relationships; Ashram stands out from them.
                        Love can only be given not asked for.
                        How can I make them feel rewarded to have come to me. Give them more than they can ask for.
                            Needs
                            Interests
                                Pretending excitement about subjects doesn't help.
                                Enjoy with them.
                                    vs serve them- essentially it's service only (giving them what they want)                                            
                                        [cultivate] love -> [Express it- ]serve their interest (favorable)- SG is 1 of them (sth of pleasure)
                                No Disapprovals (unless necessary- to teether them)
                                    E1 has his or her negative side. Don't make them feel uneasy by exposing it, even in non-judgmental way.
                                        they want to have an ecosystem of enjoyment around them. So, no upadesh to informal friends- sounds like holier than thou.
                                        Why you drink alcohol? cuz I like it (of course, it relieves me of all probs. Peps me up)
                                        See, it is not wrong. EQ world has its own rules. Being right vs being sweet.

                                Guru so kathor with disciple- very dear but gotta give shape to mani
                                        wanted to throw stone on his head.
                                        no shloka for sati. He decided how to commit slow suicide thru shloka.

                        Our shasan, desh- shiksha, biz, riti-rivaz- euro american vishva drishti par chalta hai (it is not vaishvik, but american)
                                think from your perspective.
                                Oldest sanskriti- all got lost, not India. China is but competitor with America.
                                To guide people- we have God given right- we have done and taught people.

                                We should be ourselves. Parampara ka nirvahan apna kartavya samajha hai.
                                vrata, tyohar, etc- ghar (pita putra parampara) and Vidyalaya (guru shishya parampara)
                                we have made chiranjiva thru this. Parampara kaise banti hai- parent gave me- 7+7 generation have given me (purvaja)- sharira- Kaushal and sanskar, kshamatayein hain.
                                adhikar ho gaya automatically. No exam, no rent- just got it.
                                Can I give them sharir, sanskar back- I don't have any chance to give back.
                                To guru I can't give jnana back- they have- my astitva with them (I have this RiN (karz))- I have to repay but how.
                                I have to give to 7- so what I got from parents give to children. What got from guru, give to shishya. Those around me- unka kalyan (pass on karna)
                                no upakar (riN mukta hone ke liye)- then I can be seva nivritta.
                                What is dene ka hisaab in India- samajik jeevan bhi vinimay se hi chalta hai- I can't live without prakriti- prakriti can live without it- but I can't live in isolation (all will live together)
                                        lena aur dena- 2 types- 
                                                lena zyada, dena kam- calculate from receiving end.
                                                lena kam, dena zyada- 1 lady muni says,"May I always give more than taking."
                                                        So we are always taught- minimize your needs, increase your services.
                                                        dena makes your character grow. inner devp- jeevan vikas.
                                                        how less? Sanyasi a meal palmful and sth to wear.
                                                        how much serve? An ant giving himself is not big deal.
                                        Putra ko do.
                                        In village- 2 potatoes more. a little more milk (I will never give lesser than my earning)
                                                2 laddus by 7- giving them more. This is Indian lifestyle.
                                                zyada gaya is not tension. Zyada aaya is riN, bojh
                                                Udhar dene wala thinks how to pay back vs sleep- he will worry.
                                                        Neki karo bhool jao. Give to 7 and forget.
                                        It is sanskritik kartavya of pati patni to give - hastantarit eth we have to next generation.
                                                give birth to good child.
                                                Think of my child- individual centric thought was never Indian- social centric, God centric- my child is for society (not for me alone)
                                                He is for God. Prakriti ke riN se mukti ke liye.
                                                Legalize the lust betw man and woman is 1 thinking.
                                                        this is american thinking- agreement.
                                                        by product happens to them- legal progeny so have to care till 16- they are alone afterwards.
                                                        riN mukta hone ke liye putra chahiye- isliye vivah karo, putrotpatti karo.

                                                        Only parents can do it- none else- best to my kshamata.

                                        5 yrs- laad, 10- discipline, 15 after- be a friend- psychological sound and practically possible (after 15- he wil hold hand)
                                                w/o love, sanskar- no word of discipline- I am most important person- I am in raaj.
                                                        bedsheet seems more important than child these days. American culture.
                                                I want to pull your moonch- dadaji. dadaji takes it out only.

                                        10 yrs- taadan without this is ineffective.

                                                        taadan is not taane maarna- padho nahi to bheekh maangoge.

                                                                being santushta with what's there.

                                                                less time, more output- kaushal.

                                                ghar mein preeti jagaana-

                                                        no tendency in children- prob by mother- you don't do it.
                                                                meaning karma is seen as burden- better delegate to servants. this is tendency.
                                                                Sita would make in jungles- means she knew how to do it.

                                                        rasa not there without it- bondage doesn't come and matlab ki duniya.
                                                        how to wash clothes- CA,engg, etc.
                                                        Children need parents more than a doctor, engr.
                                                        1 who serves seniors- his knowledge, laxmi,etc eth grows.
                                                        Mother gives water to children- matri devo bhava. Pitri devo bhava.
                                                atithi satkar- children should be an active part- they are family part and parcel.
                                                        why dadaji allowed Shivaji M movie and later allowed
                                                                came to mind and did it- no training- so allowed later.
                                                                after 3 times, mother says. No means no. children understnad they are smart.
                                                                waking up in Brahma muhurta. does surya namaskar- if wrongly then demonstrate.
                                                                intimacy it brings amongst people- lagaav, aadar, sanskar.
                                                Bhavishya ka jeevan- some training should start
                                                        how he will earn- how placement in sarvajanik jeevan.
                                                        what after 12th- "depends on results"
                        Ye sab ideal hai, what's practical?
                                I thought i was speaking practical- just himmat jutao and do it- they respect
                                If this is ideal what is practical.
                        What would world say if do that.
                                Early days, a person doing bad would wonder what world will say and these days, a good person wonders the same.
                                tell intelligent answers. does scented rubber do any good!
                                satya ka paksha lene ke liye khade ho jaana- itna to himmat hona hi chahiye.
                        transition from one phase to another- 2 years- slowly and smoothly- when discipline, when love and so on.
                                he is still a child- is a valid word.
                        Bigger child/ smaller child
                                he is younger- naasamajh, you are elder- have responsibility.
                                you are intel, we have to protect him.
                                let him play all roles- as a child and as an elder brother.
                        Elder said you have to hear it- accept.
                                in that age, child can't take it.
                                child bursts st like spring.
                                Elders are still elders.
                                Children are not that nasamjh- they capture our behavior and accept.
                                Generation gap has always been there. Tolerance is less.
                                If mistake and told- then listen should be (some not even then) and listen when not mistake- don't respond then but later.
                                indirect samajhana- thru 7. Becoming parents is also sadhana- from elders, from shastra (it is not lightly)
                                Child abuse is ghatak for India (american culture)
                                        child had compained that daadi is torturing me.
                                        daadi became mad. Can't correct child? loving without punishing is spoiling and punishing without loving is unhumane.
                                        those who love have right to punish.
                                        this concept comes from countries where no concept of character, charitra.
                                        should oppose this law- not good for child.
                        Mobile abuse
                                who knows what they will do
                                        for studs/ brahmacari- no silk, no decoration, no cot, no footware.
                                        Many industries take mobiles while entering- can studs avoid mobile till 15 age- it can be difficult but not practicable (at least practical) we only dilute it.
                                taking photographs- deleting after 4 days.
                                Child/stud is not prob- father /teacher is.
                                child is minor- not intel- just bahak jaate hain- beh jaate hain.
                                No- "will do" with seniors. "why seniors do" don't ask.
                                        these are niyam. you will know later.
                                        tell me reasons then I will accept- gale utarega then- first have galaa.
                                Shringar not for children- only for couples- cosmetics not for children.
                                How much children- 2-3 (they won't understand relp- what's chacha)- 1 is not allowed (3-4 not allowed)
                        Guna in children
                                cooking. economical. vaani, samaya- taraaju mein tol kar thode hi na;
                                alag shaili- and address acc
                        Vyavaharik thoughts- mera bharat mahaan- if we have such mata- definitely India will be mahaan.

                        God gives karma result not himself- not teacher- it's what stud does
                                how much for artharjan
                                after 13 yrs talk these things- why they do what they do
                                        broader perspective.
                                        economics of country- so don't imported material- it's important to me.
                                        no1 scolds for cheating. Better fail!
                                        no1 chastises for bad eye on women.
                                        Hand gestures- for a,b,c,d- this is copying- who can finish whole syllabus! They don't think it's wrong.
                                                paper setter also knows- not jnana or skill grows.
                                Cut paste from internet- but no dhyan.
                                        what is in marks- no jnana- child also knows- what's in numbers?
                                        without meaning e1 does.
                                        Tell the child to be in furnace of dharma, paricharya ki, anjnapaalan ki, etc.
                                        asset by the time they are 16. now they are svatantra and meaningful- I have 16 yr child with me- what anxiety I have.
                                        I have given this child to society.

                            IQ
                                Goal setting- anything gravitated towards.
                                Learning phase- Take shelter of (or choose) a right teacher- or even a set of right teachers- you confide in that they will make you master.
                                    learn from them- draw essence- reiterate- become them!- standardize the standard things.
                                Application phase- Apply learnings in different situations and scenarios.
                            IQ Ideal
                                    My idea is to propose the right thing with full clarity and ability to answer challenging questions - they are free to choose anything they want (being my customers).
                                    I will accept and plan accordingly, even deliver accordingly. 
                                    If later on something falls short, you can tell the reason why it's happening and why they better listen to you next time. 
                                    Even if they don't listen to me next time, it's their choices and their reactions and not my big deal. But I remain master of my craft no matter what!!
                                    Moment of clarity - my customer is the clients but my manager or PO is my customer - don't make it explicit but that's how it is.
                            IQ - Fun, Healthy other layers
                            IQ Stories - Once I had raised JIRA bug on open source Presto and they were quite responsive in 1-2 days response came.
                            IQ - Employee then always keep playing with your market value. If businessman then your deft at ascertaining the future demands.
                            IQ - Specialization in CS or Software world is bringing perfection in some aspect of software development like UI, Libraries, PL, Database Admin, etc.
                                    Specializations also include Testing Experts (Testers), Design Experts (architects), Deployment Experts (Operations Leads), Maintenance Experts (Support Experts), Requirements Experts (Consultants).
                                    Development is a lot more variegated in terms of specializations. like mentioned - UI, Libraries, PL, Database Admin, etc.
                                    DS is just aspect of intelligence from data; rules or information mining for real world applications; or making processes smarter (decision making without person intervention).
                            IQ - No matter where a person in a company is a fish in the water ecosystem so it is important to be mindful of personal growth.
                                    and never be deluded that it's all cuz of me - of course you contribute a lot but facts have to be understood - it's all about us.
                            IQ - AI vs DS = Analytics, experiments to conclude theories about data or make assertion about data with proper scientific methodology.
                                    Analytics and AI have an intersection - AI is for making smart processes which can be transactional in nature. Analytics can also use non-smart/intel ways of making inferences from data - say OLAP SQL, Excel, viz like tableau, hadoop frameworks, etc.
                                    ML is intersection of the 2.
                            IQ - work + metawork - where my time is being spend - all obstacles are documented. Accountable for your work.
                            IQ - BE - CG, DSP, etc all done nicely only not that I was apathetic but more on workings and not top down of real world requirements.
                                    change in that attitude was necessary - end result is clear and you work for it - that's what you get.
                                    few subjects not so good cuz of bad faculty like DIP, otherwise I was good in eth else. JS can't argue it didn't get my interest but all programming anyway.
                                    didn't know web frameworks cuz no investments - primarily systems got my interest.
                                    OO primarily grew with 1st job Infy.
                            IQ - We are nodeJS - we pick up whatever is at hand FIFO - rather pick up as per priority with max that's doable. Basically mgr is our customer - we serve as they suggest.
                                    pre-emption? yes, based on dynamics of priority and practicality also - if accessing system next time takes 30 mins - better invest 15 mins now and finish it off.
                                    greedy approach to deadlines? No, priority based access - serve your customer the best, that's all.
                                    this flexible in + and - in terms of time but to a limit. After that we give that day a break.

                                    so you like stability; get offers but like to stick to place - you know people, tech, etc.
                                    Do you explore system in free time? no, not free time but problems are opportunities to go deep. 
                                    We already have some idea - just reinforced by implementation when problem shows up. 
                                    Standardize the explorations for the next time else your memory will help you.

                            IQ - The heck with worldly considerations. I just want me showing up something interesting to my manager (customer) every week.
                                    whether project "rebases" (git rebase) it or not, it definitely comes in my set of achievements.
                                    you always hunt for good ideas but at any point in time, you have to be working on 1 idea even if it doesn't seem feasible 
                                            replace it with something feasible ASAP but sth is always there.
                                    showing POC in local run (GIT type S4One vs SAP Logon) is much easiler than having only single tenant for development 
                                            when you develop something even for testing, that's done for everyone.
                                    any study or reading or learning - immediate thought - where can I apply it in my current product!
                            IQ - Paper - just apply ideas learnt to different domains.
                                    take up any real world problem or desirable usecase and reduce it to mathematical terms to solve it or take a given solution and apply it to another domain.
                                    have strong engg skills to be able to do problem solving of any given problem.
                                    have strong architectural skills to make protocols, make flexible and elegant attractive systems.
                                    paper writing is more of less - the attitude of sambandh - have everything fully connected - apply development of 1 field to every possible thing you can think about.
                                    eg - physics applied to gaming, ML applied to a non-CS field, etc.
                            IQ - SQL - why do we load rows in batches - cuz customer does not need all at once.
                                    and sql supports offset, FETCH NEXT number_of_rows ROWS ONLY; - this means that all are brought at once.
                            IQ - If you call it magic. You don't understand it well.
                            IQ - IDEA - read the mails for rollouts, eg - whever raising bug use this code - let all the mails create a model and whenever you are on JIRA with similar context, propose the code.
                            IQ - Vocab - ECO is facade - no, adaptation of the BO.

                            IQ - Browser is still graphics drawing on the canvas only
                                    HTML just gives specifications of what to draw 
                                    how to draw is still taken care by browser only - so HTML is just layer on top of raw drawing.
                            IQ - B Tech makes you engineer but M.Tech makes you an architect (abstract out all capabilities of techs and plan around them); PhD makes you a scientist.
                                    Best of B.Tech guy - works in start up mode (quickest smartest achiever) - owns the product, knows ins and outs.
                                    Best of M.Tech - Creates best market solution (maintainable, elegant) - designs the product.
                                    Best of PhD - changes the thought paradigm.
                                    My Teacher recommended as an Masters guy - master technologies in a day (sleep maybe a little less for a while)
                                    Evolution - 
                                            Top Down (expected tasks to be done) - first change the config file, then change the exit (steps)
                                                    Temptation for bottom up should be avoided at this stage - this becomes important in later stages.
                                            Explore (what happens under the surface - idea or viz) - how the solution is being engineered (how it works)

                            IQ - The economics of your work is evident how consumers respond to your bids. 
                                    You place your bid worth for certain amount of your work and you don't hear from them means that they (specific not generic) perceive the bid to be too high.
                                    We need 1 consumer who values our "share" of the worth at which we want to sell it. So, see the general trend and fluctuate your bids wisely with considerations.

                            IQ - Karthik many a times uses the strategy of trying different combinations to the black box of software product. Instead making it whitebox for every ticket.
                                    what combination works but what doesn't - so what's the missing link - so framework is assumed to be robust and give them input what works and what doesn't.
                            IQ Discussions - not to say that git ain't cool but that it's not the only cool software out there - every software is cool and this is one of many cool softwares.
                            IQ Discussions - In previous company they gave no case study and people didn't do it on their own so on the field learning which doesn't work at its best 
                                    so good that sap dedicated some time for case study after the training.
                                    That graph had Oracle high up there - it was SME not ERP. Oracle is good competitor but SAP is good in many other dimensions - the number of top customers it has for eg.
                            Width of all domains, depth in 1 (CS techs)
                                specializations in CS - are by domains the principles remain the same, techs remain roughly the same.
                                don't be so devoted to domain cuz we have always changed that but keep the undercurrent techs same (utils for different pursuits)
                                biology at its core and applying it for different disciplines - environment, wildlife, medical, drugs, etc.

                                If you go on for a PhD you will have to specialize in something, but that something may not remain your speciality for the rest of your career.  Don't limit yourself by focusing too soon.
                                Figure out the biggest, the most desireable problem to solve for which they need you more then you need them.
                                It should be something which is easy for you and comes naturally. If there is such a thing.
                                pick what you study based on what interests you, and what you feel you can invest a significant amount of time and energy on.
                                don't go by what's hot cuz that changes over time in like 5 years.
                                first determining how your interest compares between them. Rank them; you'll probably find that they fall into a natural interest level ranking

                To achieve something- it takes conditions MET.
                it is in organizing your jnanendriyas and karmendriyas for any fruit desireable
                When you do that you must without foundation- you get busted.
                
                Eustress helps you by demanding (marks, ratings etc are friends)
                You are only person running to learn stuff. Take help if not understanding something.
                Jnana vs IQ- Breadth of knowledge is important but depth of knowledge in eth is gratification of intelligence.
                        do within quota and serve thru that. translate into service else maya.
                In IQ (varna) no effort should go wasted. In that case, time stolen by Maya
                        I want my every "Time Spent" find its use/make a diffn- in myself, relp, society.
                        MMN->Temperament (you like it, lose trakc of time)->Desires (affected by associations)->Deserve (thru actions and inspiration thru associations,role models)->Guna, Karma->IQ,EQ->Customers.
                        Project tasks should be labelled as urgent, important and prioritize accordingly.
                EM Tell what time you can deliver it.
                Do Outta Interest
                    Follow you bliss (FUN)
                        Today- what is it that I carry with me- what I did out of like.
                                eg- 1st sem subjects.
                        No fear of life security- one day we will have to die. Live life of choice (heart)/ not compulsion.
                                of course not MOI. that's cheating happiness- doesn't last.
                                Not what Krishna wants. Or not how samaj works.
                                willingness of dharma but live your way.
                                make your IQ your fun (under healthy pressure (we determine))
                10 hrs for head-on (top down) and other time (like basketball player- bottom up- sharpen the saw)
                    work smart means top down. work hard means bottom up.
                    be miser at work, not lazy at work.
                        understand need= achieve depth and width as desirable.
                Enjoy landmarks of your vision. Identify reward system for that.
                Things must be demanding (deadlines) so that we have impetus to improve.
                choose IQ s.t. 
                    u enjoy, pick up quickly
                    u like spending time on it. 
                    you forgeet time
                    if u r rich already, what will you do.
                    can use it to relate or contrib.
                Pressure
                        Presentations on what you have done new - so do new things with your product
                        Be available for any clarifications - taking initiatives like KT, etc. Peers, etc.
                        Note the time you need to solve incidents - it should reduce over time - instead of finding it out - you should tell answers or check 1 place not n places.
                                need standardizations and checkpoints for that.
                        don't keep silent in meetings - speak up - even if there is a risk of becoming wrong.
                        be shameless at asking seniors but ask very rarely with no repetition - it should be a gap which you seek, it can't be found out thru exploration.
                        scare yourself as much as possible - get bored with scaring yourself.
                        Means
                                Pange lo - in all realms - ask if you can refactor the scanned invoice code, etc.
                                be the fastest to be able to do anything. to be able to explain sth the best in least possible time (layers of abstraction)
                <ArtOfJobs>
                        introduce yourself
                        what all you know
                                you quote stats, python - then questions from there.
                                language
                                ML part - this is where impression lies.
                                        regression (linear, logistic), bagging boosting, neural networks you say then that direction.
                        what is project (what all done till now)
                                what approach you took - which tools, etc.
                                what challenges, etc - chidiyan nahi maari - just that.
                        what all in past
                                discussion about it
                        some questions in the mind of questioner
                        goof 2-3 interviews.
                                you can always sit after 6 months.
                                no1 knows if some other project already interviewed.
                                thoda kat ta hai automatically next goes good - bezti hone do; you get to know your state - anybody asks you want an interview, I would say yes (good pressure)
                                tweek your resume and strategy over time - learn keeping; focus on what's needed 
                                like we prepared for entrance exams.
                                        so courses are important but after 12th - exams, how much revision, restrategize.
                                        feedback if you reach higher stage - technical fall short then feedback even you know.
                                eg - resume mein fekna - pakad lete hain so improved
                                        so regular feedback is important and never get demotivated. 
                                        keep trying - what they are looking for you don't know.
                                        like sas - given a case that only 1 who has encountered will know - have you worked on it or not.
                                                vs tool on jigsaw, python take any case study and solve - done!
                                                titanic case study and half problems solved.
                                                standard things we repeat all the times. 
                                                faced little problem cuz data structured didn't know at that time but a little practice - you are CS guy, better for you.
                        theoretical questions mostly - ML questions expected.
                                what is theory; why this and not - real life situ which algo - what this coefficient means.
                                why is it boosting and not bagging, etc.
                                mathematical, code, tool - kuchh bhi but data ka solution do - use excel if small so gotta go to R
                                R can't handle big data - only your own system - neural networks so use python - deep learning so e1 on there.
                                visualizations - better taleau, BI; if small then even excel will do.
                                which tool will give best results for which case.
                                if assignments then you know answers - many things they told in videos are directly asked.
                        Trying on a role within a team is perfectly acceptable (and in fact natural if not desirable)
                            but if you also want - then there's a clash and 1 has to prove to be better than other.
                            otherwise, 1 should always follow their bliss and there's nothing wrong with that - in fact, nth wrong with competing also but be sportive in it.
                    <Misc>
                    no1 gets recruited as architect after m.tech unless off-campus or so.
                            but your knowledge calibre is of that standard and tools/techniques, etc are at your beck and call for solving real world business/ technical problems.
                            as an engineer, switching between data models and process models should never be a big deal for you cuz architects come up with data and process models for any problem instance.
                            philosophers or scientists or researchers don't come up with instances of existing data and process models 
                                    but make a new paradigm of the same. 
                                    In other words, the buyers of researchers are not developers or end users but architects. 
                                    They get one for tool in their arsenal to address real world problem instances 
                                            thru their culmination of all engineering across different existing technologies done by engineers.
                            my mindset is more like a researcher. 
                                    I have always explored (liked and cherished) different paradigms of data models and process models 
                                            viz social studies, languages, biology, Science of all types, maths, engineering drawing, core theoretical CS, Systems CS, Application CS, Data Science.
                            Learning happens like Neural networks 
                                    seeing many eg of positive and negative eg and acting - getting feedback as cost function and modulating your behavior 
                                    so going thru all those researches, you get the capability to emulate that yourself.
                                    same concept can be applied to how you learn driving with cost function and all. You raise it and you drive more cautiously.
                                            cost function is different for different people (may be types of people)
                            Career is about finding a patreon to fund or sponsor what you like to do, that's all. 
                                    Different intellectual achievements are possible but preferably, 1 ego that you target. 
                                    Not that you must become a researcher as a designation but you know yourself better and can act like one in your subtle body and enjoy VA.
                                    so changing data and process model is a thing I have always been doing.
                                            REL biology has different process models like microscope, centrifugation and all.
                                            anything new in any of the fields fetched Ph.D - now those "new" things get taught in universities as curriculum.
                                            how solve a problem in that field saw industry implementing what's already done for common public (engineers) 
                                            architects driving the show from published papers - mapping academia to industry.
                                            scientists coming up with different paradigms like microscopy, centrifugation, power drugs in medicine, etc.
                                                    it could be abstract ideas for sheer knowledge sake were developed further.
                                                    or they could be concrete idea for some or all architect to monetise (or they monetised it themselves thru patent)
                                                    the exploration of mainly "what's possible and what's not". That's what theoretical computer science studies.
                                                    exploration of problems faced by architects or questions or concerns raised 
                                                            REL like why slow or can we fasten it - so algorithmic way of performance and once more, what's possible and what's not.
                            Another insight
                                    Any work - make data model and make process model in hierarchical form.
                                            there's what's taught and there's personal understanding - make one of your own as separate complex element for both.
                                    So PO UI elements - then PO ECO elements - PO BO elements and so on - making graph db for this may be a good idea or xml. 
                                            Importance from top to bottom.
                                            also specify mappers like BSA, etc for how to get mappings from top to bottom.
                                    Process Model - user triggered actions and their data flow diagram levels. Structure diagram and what not - down to its implementation level.
                                    say you are a doctor or any other role - you need data model of your craft, and make process model involved in DFD levels and that's it.
                    Major AI or DS - I have a right to say that my M.Tech specialization is DS cuz
                            Unofficial courses - The additional courses of GIS, Network Science for Web, Maths - LA, DM, 
                            Touched upon - Data Visualization, Foundations of Big Data
                            Myself - Prob and Stats under Sal Khan, AI, Approx Algos, Maths of ML under Andrew NG.
                            Internship - Distributed Computing
                            Official courses - DM, DA. 50% enough to make any specialization for me. Project what label do I give it said professor - I choose DS.
                                    I gave CS at that time cuz of my obsession with RnD but on reflection I think it is more suited as DS. AI is CS but more specifically you can call it DS.
                                        frankly seeing all special courses it makes it CS seeing what you gravitate towards is RnD or capabilities of techs - DM, TOC, OOAD, Project; DA, NS, DP, Project.
                                        you can see some are systems, some are SE, some are DS; Project can deflect you to any label you want - with due consideration I call it DS.
                                    Project ideas - it is pretty neat ideas.
                                            given specification file - use constraints or guards for created data - all AND so easy to solve alone. Constraint Solvers and Linear Programming also supported.
                                            given abstract to concrete mapping file - nobody ain't gonna make it so get visual images of the web page and we can read labels and perform mapping thru computer vision.
                                            Parsing comes under CS generally - that was one reason I chose CS. Data creation using guards say regex given for date - can we create a sample date - yeah!
                                            1 is first user acceptance testing OR testing web app using specification files. 
                                                    Another test can be recording screens as user uses them and using it to suggest next move to selenium tool 
                                                    but that's dumb cuz say currency deleted from master data, all those successful scenarios will fail suddenly.
                    Architectures
                            There are many types of architectures - MVC for Client Server, P2P, the one that hadoop uses.
                            Think of them as subclass.
                            There are many instances of architectures - SQL, ByD, Hadoop.
                    Nature of Work
                            Management Consulting typically involve case topics which are more strategic in nature, and concern senior leadership. Cases are around 3 broad buckets
                                    1. Strategy: These cases can range from Market Entry (e.g. “should we enter market X?”), to Go to Market (e.g. “what is the best way?”) to Growth (e.g. “how do we grow?”), among others. Strategy cases are few and far between these days
                                    2. Operations Improvement: These cases try to answer questions such as “is our cost optimized?” There are a lot more operations improvement projects available
                                    3. Implementation Programs: These are basically project management exercises. Once the project in point 1/2 gets completed, it typically moves to implementation phase
                            Analytics Consulting/ Business Analytics project are more tactical in nature typically concerning mid to senior management. It can be loosely broken into these three areas
                                    1. Descriptive: This is regular Business Intelligence (or “BI”) that involves lot of report generation for daily/ monthly tracking of key numbers and KPIs. This work is repetitive in nature and increasingly getting automated. The key question it answers is “what is going on with business?”
                                    2. Prescriptive: This is about working with datasets to perform deep dives to understand root cause, conduct exploratory analysis, test hypotheses etc. The key is to come up with “why is something happening, what are the implications and what to do about it?”
                                    3. Predictive: This entails lot of modeling work (simplest example being Regression) to answer “what would happen in future?”
                            Tools/ Skill set
                                    Management Consulting requires

                    My Intellectual Future Analysis
                            RnD
                                    Shortcoming - Papers publishing never done.
                            Systems
                                    Pro - I know workings at the code level while others just know the final details - I can map functional specifications with algorithms and also with classes with a little thought.
                                    Cons - It's humungous world; Systems has seen saturation but new fields like distributed and cloud computing are being built and maintained.
                                            very black boxed - if sth ain't working - ask someone. Eg - kernel update steps failed - why?
                                            need hardcore algorithms so quite separated from the physical world.
                            Frameworks and Utils/ DevOps
                                    Pro - Connecting world (being at the center of eth in software that goes on)
                                            a lots of personal elegant projects on algorithms in real life. Lots of money.
                                            you stay in touch with eth => everything comes in full circle - all the studied concepts start to make sense.
                                    Cons - lots of mundane works in maintenance; eventually e1 moves to expertise as consultant, architect, manager (in India)
                                            but end up using their API eg cryptography we don't make algos but only call them - even implementing from scratch is rework.
                            Data Science/ AI
                                    Pro - been most rewarding at college, even at work; mathematically elegant feels like doing something that needed investment (more sense of achievement)
                                            wasted effort of hadoop, ML, knowledge - can use them in others also but not daily.
                                                    kinda problems that I solved at Siemens - makes me feel awesome but effort
                                            I really want to do it. I love doing it in my spare time - excels, which words are most used in intellectual realm thru word count.
                                            It's been very rewarding to me.
                                            All JDs make me think that it involves everything studied - so will prove to be useful. Shell scripting, networks, distributed computing, 
                                            Growing field
                                            Switching jobs is relatively easy - others every company will have their own frameworks and data models, tools, etc.
                                    Cons - Fear that work is not trivial. Fear of wasted efforts on developments like HTML, OOPS/ DP, UML, etc.
                                            At Siemens, I enjoyed but I didn't like extra effort over things - so solvable thru homework b4 joining
                            More - Services from other fields - DevOps uses ML tech; recall in our framework we used REST API, bootstrap, etc to demo final usable product to customer.
                                    Unlimited data models to track is common issue with every field.
                                    M.Tech should make me architect - ability to solve customer problems in terms of planning around technologies available.
                                            B.Tech should make you engineer - ability to solve problems around technologies but can't make mansions out of customer requirements.
                                            don't run after just knowing the technologies; but leveraging them to build something huge.
                            Insights
                                    Strive strongly for DS with Development as fallback.
                                    Put in all the effort with no repeated evaluations.
                                    criteria should not be to avoid efforts but doing justice to what  you are!
                                            of course, one should avoid too much of effort else that sucks energy from other life components.
                                    can't do injustice to present for the sake of future.
                                    Plan around 8 hrs of Learning + Practice.
                    All fields of Computer Science are but different domains.
                            be it systems, applications, frameworks, analytics - all around 1 topic solving a problem for its all instances.
                                    within applications there can be verticals or horizontals like accounting, banking, purchasing, selling, HCM, etc.
                                    so should be the case with systems - very high level it can be OS, network devices or softwares, etc.
                                    analytics should also run parallel to application verticals.
                                    Tools or frameworks? IDE, Compilers (should be in systems), DBMS, etc.
                            the business analytics world doesn't strictly fall under computer science but is more of an offshoot - uses the computer science world as a consumer.
                            the time spent in defining problem statement, trying all ML processes, choosing the model, training the model are all but different aspects of designs in computer science - which design will work and which will not - these are architectural discussions for the software building only.
                            different technologies in prime focus and others of less importance for every field - but no field has copyright over technologies developed in Computer Science.
                                    these verticals serve each other and grow mutually
                                            Eg - we invoke invoice scanning thru an API which has its model trained as a separate exercise.
                                            Eg - windows has to update their OS and tools as per the usage trends of their customers and competitors like android - for better user experience.
                                            Eg - we deploy our app using docker or kubernetes container which is developed by systems developers for better DevOps.
                            Even hacking is a skill for computer scientist for not just the security aspect but also for which situation can take your designed system to an undesirable state - the undesirable state can be something against function expectations.
                                    Eg - how could an empty row get created without change log.
                                    Eg - how was there a fluctuation in number assignments.
                                    Eg - how did the 2 documents end up with same number assigned - racing condition, etc concepts come in handy.
                            Everything else is utility in computer science - 
                                    eg linear algebra - 
                                            Circumstantial Usage - Create Applications or solve real world specific problems (even extending functionality of applications (extensions)
                                                    can be used to solve a real world problem which may involve or can be reduced to vectors, matrices, coordinate geometry.
                                                            Eg - think of purchase order item quantity and unit prices like 2 vectors and multiply them in 1 shot.
                                                            Note that matrix multiplication can have algorithms with lesser time complexity and of course saves effort.
                                            Create Services outta that - 
                                                    Contribution to Community - Libraries - can be used to create services readily usable by developer community
                                                            eg linear transformation of vectors, etc.
                                                    Develop career outta it - Technologies or Tools - implementing linear algebra to create a real world services like regression in statistics 
                                                            which can in turn by used by end users who may or may not need some business acumen.

                                                            Eg - Machine Learning API's, NLP API's, Tools to perform ML, etc.
                                            Help teachers back - Frameworks or Tools -
                                                    can be useful in scientific community
                                                    this will hasten their processes.
                                                    different from library in that this will have all end to end product implementation with exits for end user to customize or adapt.
                                                    REL hypothetically - LaaS - Linear Algebra as a Service/Product
                                                    Eg - R, Octave, etc.
                    CS World - all have unique data model but same skillset required - DSA, DP, Maths, etc ; applied to different world.
                            RnD - Science world of what's possible - fine tuning, come up with generic architectures, new use cases thru new capabilities, etc. 
                                    all ideas go from here to 1 of the following.
                                    Eg - coming up with an idea of making a Database instead of community using files.
                                    Eg - coming up with an idea of automating the User Acceptance Testing.
                                    Eg - Idea for knowledge representation in semantic web
                            IaaS - Systems - Foundation - Platform that enables the software community with capabilities
                                    OS, Network Systems, Graphics, Distributed Computing, etc.
                            PaaS - Tools - B2B Development Softwares - Softwares targetting software development community to be able to develop better like DB, etc.
                                    Making Data Science Softwares, Making hadoop, Benchmarking studio, etc.
                                    has no utility for technically naive users - eg database helps you manage huge data records systematically but you will have tough time operating it - CRUD.
                                    eg - all transaction in SAP Logon will be useless to end users even though they manage so much deep knowledge about the system with more controls and flexibilities
                                    OS on web, IDE on web, java, etc.
                            SaaS - Apps - B2B or B2C Naive (technically) User Softwares - Softwares targetting the end naive users community with value addition services.
                                    using hadoop for analytics, using ML for predictions out of the box - used developed concepts to different areas and predict, explore, prescribe.
                                    developing IRCTC web site, Flight web sites, etc - (hard core algos required here as well) - help carry out transactions.

                                    Even frameworks comes under this - general functionality made specific by certain processes.
                                    Domains - Gaming, eCommerce, Online Streaming, Food Service, Cab Service, Bookings, ERP, Blogs, etc - there are also subdomains under each.

                <ProblemSolving> also includes silly mistakes
                    Silly mistakes are terrible - creating GSA thru the back end.
                            lt_node_id was not being cleared every time the execute_action was being called.
                            net_amount was being changed while it's a read only attribute but that's not a serious problem
                            saving in the end ignoring that the second action could have been skipped resulting in 1st checkpoint getting saved.
                    Silly mistake that I was using different interface in rule group didn't check it - when it comes to configuration - that is all.
                    Silly Mistake - In octave, instead of (1/(2*m))*sth, I used (1/2*m)*sth
                            forgot the formula in the process - eth up to the mark except that dividing by m was not being performed for delta computation.
                            matrix power 2 or matrix division are operations at matrix level - while you must be expected element wise division.
                    Silly mistake - Checking account assignment of Purchase order and talking about supplier invoice that has changed to G/L from GSA which is anyways nonsense.
                    Silly Mistakes
                            Folder last modified on 26th April doesn't mean that file inside it could not updated 5 mins back - no premature judgment.
                    Silly Mistake - all I had to do was that after maintaining master data - I had to save PO and reopen to find errors no longer existing.
                    silly mistake - formula not seen properly - sigma^2 instead of sigma, inattention.
                            copy pasting the suggested code although the variable doesn't exist.
                            brackets mismatch.
                    Problem Solving
                            running an exercise includes a very heavy assignment which takes 5 mins 
                                    so better remove the code of that assignment after it's corrected and evaluate all others (assuming no dependence), after all done reinstate it - benefit time got saved.
                    Silly mistake - outer loop resetting the value of count for writing on an arry.
                    Given a problem with all variations, try to solve simplest problem and then try to go step by step variations to solve final difficult version of it.
                            Eg - How to read QR code -read first square version, standard image with standard dimensions of square, with varying distance so different dimensions
                                    then rectangle version on vertical side and horizonal side separately. also observe a rhombus version.
                                    Now try solving the problem of solving rhombus problem as a variation from vertical side. when parallelogram version.
                                    solve now version of upside down with angle.

                                Doctors - are expert supports for human body system. They are engineers but technicians.
                                    expert support means technicians
                                Arts is also a field with architects and technicians for social science or psychology
                                Commerce - technicians of developed social systems
                                Assertion - architects build frameworks and ain't supposed to know application knowledge.
                                    then consultants who have deep application knowledge who represent customer - who are they? 
                                    They may have knowledge of being consumers of frameworks but don't build it.
                                    after the frameworks is built - the support for app dev has to continue
                                            any new requirement - let's say GDPR - what it means for framework - architects are required once more.

                                        deep dives into more electives than BT (aka specialization) => more understanding of your major.
                                        lot of focus on writing papers, reading papers (thesis) and projects
                                ======================================
                                For every course/subject/project - ask what leverage has it granted to you. Ability to build smart or intelligent applications.
                                        Building ERP is just a world problem solved.
                                        with languages we can organize and manipulate information - test it, extend it, retrieve and modify it (maintain informations in structured ways; OOAD - organize informations)
                                                Network Security - ability to build secure systems (safety of user's data - encryption)
                                                        blockchain - building trust across systems.
                                                AI

                                More Notes
                                    Leverage that M Tech gives is that it is supposed to take you to architectural thinking and not just technological and engineering thinking
                                    There is general Computer Class and it has many specializations Classes (Inheritance)
                                        B Tech courses give an opportunity for specialization with a few courses but not many.
                                        M Tech courses go in great depth for a specialization.
                                        On Field Learning or working knowledge for B Tech can enable him to be a professional of the field (not necessarily a specialist)
                                        A B.Tech guy can always do online course or read books to get foundational level knowledge to be as good as a masters guy - what's possible - am I being exhaustive.
                                        If pro guy faces a problem, he runs to a specialist.

                        architect 
                                on customer saying that 10% of their use case is this 
                                Currently this is a system limitation and we will take it up in future releases
                        Architect
                                Clear veredict - if there is clash between disablement and setting initial of data value - let go of disablement if it is taking toll on development.
                                think of alternatives - script assignment to initial failed but we have another alternative of using assign data operation to assign a value. Trying that worked just fine.
                        Architect
                                Talks - gotta be really good with vocabulary (reflected in speed of speech and corrections)
                                        correct vocab - it's not "rule", it is "code" and code can't be....
                                Meta-Talks - associating weights to the points spoken, This statement doesn't take into account..., I can't agree more on this..., I don't agree,...
                                        I don't think that's a good argument, I don't buy that argument, etc.
                                        My take on this is....
                                        clearly express - sorry, I didn't follow (not apologetic)
                                sandwich formula - all this is fine but you see - pratyaksha to praman kya.

                                Persuasion - by ignoring the problem, it will not go away - gotta get our hands dirty, man.
                                        deal with it man - can't go to heaven without dying.
                                        architectural retrospects - see you solved it yourself - it was not that big a deal
                                Fun guy - decorations around pure talent - poetic, funny, jovial - as the saying goes you can't reach heaven without dying.
                                        this can't be a replacement for pure talent but a decorations around it.
                                Political tactics - Plead ignorance.
                                        if it is his decision, it is his responsibility.
                                go low level - explain how they could break their work to get it done.

                                many of the questions asked from developers or others are exhaustive based - "is this the only way to do it?" kinda questions.
                                        solution you gotta know system exhaustively and also you don't hesitate asking, approaching or asking to approach the Right person who can help.
                                some questions relate to management - eg - have you implemented any mdro in this sprint or in this development cycle.
                        architect
                                challenge - how will you do what you claim; on what basis.
                                you make a claim and other blindly opposes it - solution raise a capability question and raise an onus on him to explain his approach. 
                                        If jugaad, then tell fallacy with that and tell clearer approach.
                        Architect
                                Levels - see it done, confirm and do, do and confirm, do and inform, clarify, independently productive.
                                Tell approach when not understood by others - that respects their authority and helps others - max service protocol also served and your authority also established.
                                Paraphrase to help others understand when wrong statement is quoted - rather than fighting or clarifying with him showing as if you are learning
                                        the way I understand or understood is that ....
                                firmly established in concepts. Veni Vidi Vichi - correct ASAP.
                                best learning is hands on - limited time so sequence the learnings.
                                anything done or so - see it at a higher layer - thru practice.
                                        like consultant - how it works from user point of view or architect - how to implement that
                                        ability to discuss the day in high level layer of PIES is a good communication skill and helps all of them in the association part and also creating friendships.
                                Narrative with you - that's why I started the session with that. Is it clear? I know it will be difficult in the beginning (low response narrative)
                                        Please let me know if the approach needs a change.
                                        when others try to dictate your course of action - with the end result in mind you override the specific course with one that you think will work the best.
                                Ask a practical or question that establishes your deep knowledge in the matter.
                                take teaching initiative when you know shit.
                                This is clear but my question was.
                                There are many teams why targeted.
                                team integration - you gotta know whose services we consume and what they are supposed to do 
                                        if ain't working - consult on ping, approach, mail, skype meeting, internal incident.
                                        don't approach for trivial questions - that's why LXP in every team for what we use.

                                        Work it out in terms of trying thru intellisense or cursory exploration of the underlying classes
                                        Make proper data model thru the study and

                                No1 can say they know it all - just don't give up easily.
                                gotta accomodate ego of people but if top level is properly demanding like Jurgen Sattler then that's not a problem.
                        Architect - Decision Making - truth table or not
                                idea of clause is are candidates for delivery and 2ndly delivery ain't already done.
                                Y is not sufficient but necessary so Negation OR of N seems to be the best bet
                                Lot of conditions are subsumed by the other.
                                Is any combination of Y sufficient for finish relevance?
                        Architect - I told that's not the way you do it but they insisted so let them explain their version to the customer.
                                I said I would be busy with other meetings on the day. Don't invite me for the meeting. The onus is on you for your convictions.

                                        quote authority
                                        challenge back with questions replacing any noun or verb with a question. IOW turn the tables and test the completeness of their claim or "system view" instead of world view.

                                divide automates among team member and review the status along with error messages across sprints.
                                verbose about philosophy on how you do things.
                                        Eg - I never send bulk mails only point to point - those who are relevant
                                Architect - 1 ticket and such deep thinking - like Nike Just do it. First take action, regret later
                                Arch - RBT different from developers.
                                atomic - do it fully or don't do at all - not referable since you did that you can also do this for consistency.
                                Arch - ByD kachra - every new deal to avoid breaking the existing or complying with existing situation did Patch 
                                        vs dare for right thing - like using design pattern when required, refactoring as the code was becoming too much for a method.
                        Architecture
                                Capacity Planning - let's work on the weekend and make the capacity available for development 
                                        else you can't be trusted with development and eventually someone else will have lead that once belonged to you
                                        ability to visualize the sequence of events that are likely to happen
                                Scapegoat they are searching at the moment cuz of falling short and we should not be unnecessary victims.
                                Users should never come to know about our internal objects - like Inbound Delivery Notification should not be shown on the screen.
                        Architect - you get lots of HR questions - make a tool for HR Direct tickets and boast number of tickets you solved.
                                basically always give an impression that you are on work and things are measurable and getting better.
                        Architect - discussion with the customer
                                Discussion logical arguments at high layer - be convinced of the correctness of the assertion - go in details if not understood or needs more explanation 
                                        (maybe in separate session or thru documentation)
                        Architect - what gives you power

                                for controller object, the member variables are objects usable as part of "workspace" for returning the "promise".
                                one huge blob of code with no refactoring, bad naming or naming without proper conventions (what is all list, what is list under consideration, what is sequence of refering to semantics of the variable)

                                                what are the variables that don't carry any semantic meaning - backtrack to find out.

                                to prove algorithm wrong don't argue - just give a counter example - demo it - don't even just tell it.
                                        to claim that it's messy - ask for a dummy change.
                                then we should use the word correctly. the order of development should be...

                                State machine Design Pattern as per the status.
                                        Yes but this is already implemented in SAM - SAM will be deemed useless if you implement it.
                                        SIV State Machine - On click on SIV - depending on the state, you give custom error message or change the state accordingly.
                                1 class responsible for all checks on the model object state. Self Checks, Xnode-checks, XBO-checks.
                                        any context call should be just picking the combination of the checks from the one BO check class or BO enrichment class.
                                        facade design pattern.
                                        Even hierarchy of checks - check_root_consistency vs check_currency_consistency, etc.
                                MVC - parallelling the view with the model.
                                        that's again a very good idea but we want to retain the existing architecture and don't wanna gamble with something new.

                                1.	We have LogService being used in X4 which can be imported as “System.IO.Log.LogService‿ from @sap/x4.
                                import { System } from "@sap/x4";
                                import LogService = System.IO.Log.LogService;
                                2.	The singleton class offers many methods like emitWarning, emitError, emitDebug as per level of log.
                                LogService.Instance.emitWarning("Origin Location", "Some Warning Message");
                                3.	Observation - The LogService writes on console while debugging from UI but doesn’t write during mocha/chai unit tests.

                        Epic - Is simply a story, but is considered so large that it needs to be broken down into multiple stories. Story - Is essentially a requirement that is in a low enough detail that it can be estimated. Task - Developers, testers may break the story down further into tasks to allow them to estimate, develop and test it.
                        1 PD for SP for expert and 3 for newcomer - SP as 1,3,5 - why?
                                so not that 8 SP per person is 24 PD but person has 10 PD per sprint! Plan vs actuals match.
                                sprint burndown takes stories done as 0 or 1 but not 50% done. This means smaller stories - so also how small the stories can get.
                        1 Story as 1 validation level - or does it have to go more granular?

                                4 levels on priority. paraphrase what you said to reiterate weight on what you said if not taken seriously.
                                1 prob a time we will discuss, ok.
                                feature level syncs and tracking.
                        DB models should also be generated but not getting generated so can't test our coding at all.
                        not pulling from S4One folder - but michael's repo
                                contains only IR which we import, build and work locally - s41 completes and then pull and push into there.
                                local models - pushing to git.
                        we know 1 repo shared by Ankur - so are we gonna create a copy or what.
                                workspace which only contains the IR.
                        sit half hour see if it work else get started without out - agreed on this approach.
                                but we discussed about this yesterday, right.
                        show progress even if trivial - like moved SP to ready for dev and created tasks for it.
                Manager - Working Model
                        L3 - This terminology is one time effort on 1 exit - the same terminology will continue over other exits as well 
                        process refactoring will change somewhat but data model will give good intuition and process models will have good degrees of similarity
                        Also L3 has assumption of L2 - cuz we will retrieve lots of references and refer to fields like p_guid and what not 
                        if you don't know the data model of persistence and modules and frameworks, it is difficult to do your shit independently.
                Manager
                        L3 - many intermediate variables like cumulated item which have no significance to UI but important in processing, and many variables with impedance mismatch with UI variables.
                                Data Model of all variables involved to take a system from one state to another. All Design Patterns used after the frameworks.
                                DFD of how you have refactored your code.
                                Are you supposed to know it all - know specific to your specialization like SIV.
                        L2 doesn't bother with this extension of UI data model. He concerns himself with exits and expectations and persistence.
                                Exits, checkpoints (on model objects) with names (message creation, approval escape, etc), configurable parameters for developers 
                                what and when they get called what should be passed, etc. Your powers in any exit (that's bonus).
                                Specialization like SRM using PD framework and other modules that we use.
                        L1 - Application Area Specific Domain details, BC Configurations and Activities.
                                Specialization into SCM UI and ERP concepts in general.
                        Consulting line is roll up of all the L3 to L2 until the last and it is more of coming up with the designs. But existing systems can guide you a lot.
                                Architect is roll up of L3 to L2.
                        so iow, there's evolving data model from UI to framework to code in the exit.

                Manager - Working Model - Types of tickets and more
                        L0 - documentations, bot chat, Q and A, online help
                        L1 Functional Specification - state check thru business, behavior check thru ui transitions
                                state problem - tell a workaround and check change log to ascertain reachability. redo the scenario, try in test system, etc.
                                behavior problem - eg - screen dumps while opening - workaround for immediate solution and if really objectionable then forward to L2.
                        L2 Implementation Specification - state check thru DB or tcodes; behavior check thru exits
                                state problem - eg - db values are unexpected. there is an inconsistency. 
                                        if standard known issues w/o cause, then manual correction or reports for standardized updates.
                                        eg - some undo on screen that we don't support but customer requires that.
                                behavior problem - eg - the exit doesn't get hit or here the input values expected at exit were different from obtained. 
                                        eg - debugger manipulation to escape unnecessary messages to post.
                        L3 Implementation - state check thru i/o at exits or checkpoints; behavior check thru DFD of methods implementations.
                                state problem - some modeling or configuration level change required somewhere.
                                behavior problem - code change is required - patch, hotfix to be planned.
                        Proposal - what about state problem of every layer addressed by the one below it 
                                eg - modeling and configuration already seen by L2 than L3 - these guys already know the exits so why not configurations.
                                that way L1 team can be thought as UI and back end viewer. L2 as back end viewer and configuration corrector. L3 can be thought as code corrector.
                                doesn't look like a good idea because changing the exits is a big deal - for making it work for one tenant you should not spoil every other customer.
                        The bad the L(i), the worse L(i+1) gets in terms of tickets queue.
                        In ByD, 
                                L1 similar to product management or analyst or businessmen but business role supposed to be more,
                                        ability to map customer problems to a product or service in terms of available or trending technologies.
                                        eg - let's be able to solve your problem thru a web software which will blah blah blah...
                                L2 similar to architect but architect role supposed to be more, 
                                        ability to map functional specification of system to design or architecture.
                                        eg - let's use these specific technologies to address the specific needs of the final products. Prepare a blueprint for the final product - that's feasible.
                                L3 done by developer but developer role supposed to be more, 
                                        ability to map any design or architectural detail to implementation.
                                        eg - let's show the final product from the conceptualized product.
                                The management revolves around the entire trace to make it work.
                                        eg - capacity planning, backlog targets, evaluation scheme. L3 can quote managerial reasons for what they do.
                                        eg - feature request - L1 should reply back with the forum for ideas; 
                        Testing team - the one that ensures quality, standards and robustness of the product made. 
                                Even security, performance - all non-functional requirements are validated here.
                                confirm or test to bridge the customer expectations and development done. concretely bridges promise with the product - proof on the table.
                                this can be seen as criteria or final validation or exit criteria. So, test team is one that looks at exit criteria.
                        Operations team - the one that connects or takes development world to the end customers as delivery.
                        note - Every team maps to a stage of waterfall and it is considered a big deal. with devops these teams become seamless at flow of the product thru the pipeline.
                                that's where the concept of state of system you are working on becomes important - which codeline or version are you working on, bug is reported at, etc.
                Manager
                        permutations of what's possible in the final product.
                        focus on yoga sincerely enough that you should not gasp for air in tense/ demanding atmosphere.
                                eg - someone really senior asks a question - you take it really well. This will have a bearing on your kundalini. And also on spiritual aptitude.
                        Role of managers and consultants are very similar 
                                managers manage the org and consultants know all the technical details around it and can help any org set it up - in practice or in software.
                Manager - #Tickets for the month, SP delivered during the month, etc.
                        proportion of time you spent on each => how much ticket time and SP takes for you and can be integrated for the team.
                        Estimate our money spent on tickets alone. And money spent on development - proportionating.
                        if more tickets, then more effort on tickets this month and lesser on SP => for next month, the per ticket time for past month is high (high costs also).
                        for team planning, we will use or extrapolate from past month for available development capacity.

                        L3 - You have code but misleading or not best nomenclature - while you trace, create mapping of misleading variable names to what you would want them to be.
                                make sections of code that do one thing - by the end of the code i had abc and I have got d and e.
                                L(i) - someone can tell you with knowledge but you gotta explore to know it more. L3 algorithms you may have strong intuition or know what happens but tracing yourself you will know in and out.

                        can it be done by tomorrow?
                Manager
                        Scoping for the end result - demo - which validations are required for demo.
                        Do we have everything we need from that team to be able to integrate with them.
                        all master data we will need create an excel for that to ask them to create those API. Also, excel for guidelines for future developments.
                Manager - Sprint Retro
                        status report of sprint and where we are and reasoning.
                        how to better next sprint instead of fingerpointing - concerns not people.
                                retro from last time and see if we addressed them just fine.
                        Retro
                                unstable envt - Delayed by X4 issues.
                                        Take latest pull only on need basis else regression causes problem. At least basic checks in place.
                                        #arch - working with broken API or not fully dependable API or not fully dependable frameworks.
                                UI Designer worse than ByD.
                                Build takes time and we are tight on time.
                        Discussions - (name), can we help here. (name), I will need your inputs here. I think you can address it better.
                        too many stories and stories being added during the execution of sprint.
                                planning part and for execution part.
                                is there a guideline or can it be created - we will learn along the way. who does what - when task creation, lifecycle and close procedure.
                        new work and issues and you are in tunnel and don't know how long it will be - thanks for all guys.
                        when can we get central kubernetes system to deploy our changes and test.
                Manager + arch
                        review with real scope for the sprint - update thru mail cuz high numbers. Doesn't seem like for demo - is it complete scope - ain't you going to outbound? Shock! so you are.
                        This should have been like this - do we have documentation to comply with else it's difficult.
                        Impression - you also whatever it is we should decid that by EOD.
                        we had 12 then, is it reduced after revision.
                        usable stability of ui designer
                        cip we tried
                        integration blast testing - ariba + pricing testing vs separate and they will work together well.
                                url formed - call made to ariba and response is parsed into a temporary bo which we use to show on ui (?EC or custom made)
                        more instances vs 1st instance.
                        mom, bupa, material - data model and api expectations - for planning.
                        ML usecases - approval scenario. supplier determination in PR.
                                approvals confidence levels vs approval BTM tasks.
                        planning capacity from mukesh for tasks.
                        system for ML - SCP tenant for the service.
                        Strategy - transactions working and based on stubs - give requirements to master data.
                                vs come up with architectural plan and give requirements to master data and transactional working and updating master team with backlogs missing.
                                once more, levelled approach proves to be good.
                Manager
                        no eg to immediately start working on it but basic understanding so I can work on it.
                        compensation for early talents - over and above your existing salary so mid year hike.
                Manager - from Scrum
                        looking into cross dependency - send this to that guy to solve the dependency.
                Manager
                        All time recording topics are actually project tasks which are purchase order items which will be services delivered and invoiced eventually.
                Manager
                        User story vs PDs - to separate actual effort with development capacity based on capability etc - no ambiguity on weightage a story should carry but time taken may vary from person to person
                        Silence is acceptance.
                        let me check with my team - let me tell my expectations there - let me see if this is attainable with given timelines.
                        Please correct me or inform me if something I am missing here. Then circulate meeting with all the status updates and action items for every unique persons.
                Manager
                        Those guys can skip the meeting cuz of high priority work that they need to do.
                Manager - our situation is car has to be driven on the road that is still being built.
                Manager - while you know what's going on. Ask the status from them and check their trustworthiness.
                Manager
                        manager is java who can spawn threads and make them run and coordinate across them.
                                Developers are nodeJS - we will work in single thread of activity but during async operation we can switch to another task to attend to.
                                manager is our primary customer - ideal or healthy practice is that your customer's customers are your own customers that's empathy and is very empowering but manager can anytime override our schedules or fairness criteria told b4.
                        Manager or our customer can ask us to stretch but our office times should over day, week, month, etc should look like a normal distribution with least skew and high kurtosis.
                                if it doesn't then it maybe the time you consider changing your customer - some specialize into ability to manage many customers like for products vs service based companies - the framework and extensibility enables them to be able to do it or Time bursts or threads to distribute attending to different customers needs.
                                don't worry so much about customer's customers but be concerned about them.
                                Expert support is customer's proxy for incidents. PO is customer's proxy for product features development. Scrum master is scrum implementer as favor to the manager.
                                Manager is the coordinator of the team. He represents a larger human with all the team members his body parts.
                                He represents the team and product or application area is his responsibility. He is the one who gets things done pertaining to the product - thru his team members who are like his body parts.
                                even our regular work is also in larger picture an act of alignment (intellectually) to model and plans chalked out by manager.
                                But stretching I will, VA is so important that for Vasudhaiva kutumbakam I can skip even holiday of Janmashtami but I am not a fool to not understand the boundaries of every aspect of worldly realm. I have already lived thru a phase of (which is guilt but also grat) facing off denial of VA if I don't agree with it or am enthused about it.
                                But practically speaking, in our teams PO acts as a manager with responsibilities of scrum master, architect and customer representative (consultant) so more or less like a local manager. Even their views carry a lot of weightage - they are entrusted with responsibility of managing the team. So, think of it as 2 levels managers actively working.
                        What is crossing the boundaries - if asked to cancel tickets at last hour then he should pay for the cancellation and also booking new tickets. The pain and disrupted plans is something we will have to tolerate because the concern might be something really important.
                Manager - I have planned QA role in such a way that it will be round robbin with 3 takts for every person in role of Mentee, Practice, Mentor per takt.
                Manager - encapsulate whatever someone under you says - for a given comment, approving or extending or rationalizing to others.
                Manager - LUCID to write the activities for bridge (meta)
                        1 program at a time is the suggestion.
                        hotfix testing - kanban capture.
                        vlookup, pivots, data mining happens on the data we fill.
                        MR must response don't worry about mail flood - cuz who gave the option.
                        set status quo with positive expectations - burn out.
                        do the informaing for sake of planning.

            </IQ>
            <SQ> Ideology; KC stands out. Art of living.
                Take Stand for Eth- someone asks to tell about a book you read- tell in vivid ways.
                My life is that of an agnostic (who can deny that). 
                    I am into experimentation with a spiritual path (with inspirations (ppl), reasons (axioms, logics and convictions))
                    But parallelly enjoy gaming of material world- challenges, enjoyments, realizations, etc.
                What?
                    It is your object of devotion. Something you think is more important than yourself.
                        Worth dedicating yourself unto.
                        What is your ideology? The ideal world- of you and of society around you.
                        What is substance of your life? what adds meaning to your being.
                            It is ideal state I want to achieve in PIES personally and socially.
                Day time is for your IQ and EQ (grow your capabilities and services).
                PIES
                    IQ- College to get state of art, RnD, 100% marks
                    EQ- Excitement with people (jokes, knowledge, current affair (local and global), gossips of relevance.
                    SQ- Life in full alignment (K>I)
                        Parabrahma is eth to me.
                Vision Comes in SQ- 
                    Eg- Role Model- Hanuman.
                    GoalSettings and ActionPlan comes in Bhakti.
                Fearless
                    "what I am" is more important than labels world gives.
                            I am only affecting my states thru experiences.
                            say/ behave anything you want (are). Let others also, but reflect to grow in one's state (for happiness)
                            Grade is just a motivation factor.
                            Sehwag- I focus on my game, people will comment only what I do- why not focus here.
                                    make my work louder than my words.
                    fear no bad words- "main wo hun jo bhi tu bole" aur agar nahi hoon- why bother.
                            be a moti chamadi.
                            Abuse me anything, I am that- accept that.
                    no fear of any state of life- eth is good. 
                            My principle centered life is more important to me. Jab tak jiyunga dil se jiyunga.
                    Paresh Rawal movies- talk most pessimistic thing at once- think most pessimistic and I am ready for that if that's what providence wants.
                            prepare the worst but hope the best and plan and live the best.	
                    face it not escape it
                        head-on. Only that solve the problem. Latter just postpones it.
                Be "devotee" internally but not necessarily for people.
                Know your capabilities and utilize all resources to fullest.
                	what's ur algo to maximize enjoyment inlife and protocols, rituals, beware of traps.
                Immediate object of gratitude- Ultimate object of gratitude
                    Immediate definitely be there. intermediate when we realize it.
                    Ultimate is declared, is up to realization (if there).
                    DOn't keep your problems to yourself (ask, inform); excuse maker? so be it.
                Resume of your PIES!!
                	what all I have, I am- what stand I can take. Eg- Dancing Bhangra in EQ.
                First, We better focus on ideology for ourselves, understanding the laws the way they are.
                Next, for world ideology, social ideology- act in that direction, publicize your intent, give reasons- subscribers come, some choose otherwise.
                E1 has a right to live a lift to his terms (individual and social ideology) but pursuit of social or ideology can't break the code.
                        threaten others, lure others, (FDDL)
                        you don't have to stop them- you can divert attention if you don't like that.
                        If seriously wrong, see if sth should be done about it.
                No substitute of Hard Work
                    Our director Sir, was close friend of APJ Abdul Kalam. On his demise, he gave a speech- he said he was asked if it was gonna be a holiday. He said-
                        I knew APJ personally. We won't take holiday but work for extra hours in his memory.
                    Don't hate your actions and problems in the way- but take them as case studies to carry on with you
                    	and keep evolving thru life!
                Spirituality
                    Then how will you invest dhyan without accepting it. That's how any experimentation work. You accept it and prediction and expect results. They don't come and relinquish it.
                Bad Luck
                    Make a table- what happened; what was expected; what was missing (didn't happen); what others (who) in situ do; lesson learnt; 
                    what's good to be grateful
                        Ppl have probs you don't want (i.e don't have) and Ppl don't have luxuries, you have (taken for granted at present)
                    Karma (good or bad- gets lost eventually)
                    Story good or bad who knows- Horse ran away- came back with herd- son fell from herd's back- not taken for military war.
                        we don't know what's good?
                            I will be God vigrah- purse forgotten- wanted for donation; I want money- found purse; I am going for expedition- got arrested. Bad? He intervened- boat would sink.
                        Desire Tree- I want this and that- tiger should not come- he came. Or ask sth that would attract tigers. Or not making most out of it fear.
                        Storm in sea- ain't you afraid- held sword on her. what about you? no, I trust you. Similarly I trust my God (even he desires killing, will be best for me)
                    Smile and you get a reason
                        wear colorful charming dresses, listen happy songs/movies.
                        Love yourself.

                BY - Ego term - decision vs determination at intellectual layer.
                        vow is formalization of decision. Like we even do with marriage.
                        why live in - cuz no burden of vows or decisions - want or focus our rights (or enjoyments) but not duties (or liabilities).
                                what about hiding from family part - that's just thievery - again don't want liabilities
                        BY is engaging your ego but in perfection, surrender of ego.
                                etymology - service - it encompasses other yogic systems but with highest layer being ego - so you are a bhakta (or devotee).
                                this is simple but not easy.
                                premature exhibition of surrender of ego is dangerous and is not recommended but Krishna reciprocates with any step taken towards him 
                                        but aesthetically this is best avoided and caterpiller should avoid jumping from leaf to leaf and only crawl to another leaf - can do that faster, sure.
                                        could this be dangerous - yes, it is possible that you don't pick egos associated with VA and gotta suffer for that.
                                        SP in a lecture kindly told - better work for free but work for sure - importance of VA.
                                        but Krishna in BG says that a perfect being has no such obligation for VA but he does it anyway.
                                am i not doing BY at all? you are, since it encompasses all other yogic systems - chanting (meditation (object being Krishna)), BG (AT hunt (object being Krishna)), services (object being Krishna), etc.
                                        so you are carrying BY is broader sense of the word both yoga and bhakti but stricter or narrow sense of the word you are not.
                                        Guru is very important in this relationship. You are adopting on guidance - so you chant 16 cuz you are so instructed.
                        a cause of immature execution of BY is also doing it independently (st more st less)
                                assuming, they are not playing on you. You can always be lured into increasing your surrender of ego - but you should drive that.
                                but generally Krishna will reciprocate and it won't be a problem but the show should be driven by you.
                                surrender with intelligence and not surrender your intelligence - surrendering intelligence in JY is more of increasing of engagement of intellect.
                                But JY is thought by me as intelligence and not surrender of intellect / mind (as expected) and so your statement may not be well thought.
                        BY surrendering all ego doesn't mean getting rid of egos - that's very dangerous and will make you act immaturely.
                                it only means that all egos be subservient to 1 true ego.
                                if you must give a professional ego - why restrict to that - why not physical ego. why not mental egos - being punjabi, male, indian - it is only a welcome to trouble.
                                surrender or dependence doesn't mean giving up VA - just means daring to do the absolute right thing and the thing that's right to you and you belive in.
                                Hearing lila doesn't mean gotta imitate them (we are not at that level, we will end up acting immaturely, losing faith, thinking we are being brainwashed cuz of taking that eg literally) 
                                        just follow them meaning understand the reasons and see how it applies to your situation as a principle. 
                                        Eg - if RDG ran from home to LCM - means daring to find most condusive setting for your KC 
                                                was it a big leap of faith for him - was he looking for personal pleasure in that?
                                        or your beliefs (at mundane level it is run of freedom) but newcomer acting such will be a huge leap of faith - is important as a principle not eg.
                                        Importance - life gives many subtle problems - if concepts are not properly challenged, there is a chance of making mistakes. 
                                                Eg - not killing animal to stop enemies, not shooting religious place, etc.
                                limit your lessons to those discussed in class or those that come naturally - don't strain yourself (that doesn't help much cuz of gap in levels between devotees - we can respect PDs that acted those ways but don't act just take the lesson how much valuable they held Krishna)
                        I found the answer - egos are decided as per criteria of loving devotional service unto Krishna.
                                yes it starts of with finding a true ego but the point to get to is egos or identities subservient to willingness to serve in KC.

                                now save - will bad modify get saved (it doesn't exist in buffer and the modify is flushed already and so ain't getting triggered) so previous state gets saved.
                                solution - use previously raised messages in some buffer and show them as reason for denying save.
                                ideally you should clear changes or revert to old state if the UI change ain't gonna make it to the buffer.
                                        UI and buffer should not be outta sync - recall MVC Design Pattern.

                    Role divisions - architectural roles exist for everyone of them. 
                            All it takes is Intellectual health + Strong will + do the home work for apprenticeship (pay the price) + harness guidance.
                                    so many eg of people from different academic specialization doing really well at different stream of work - cuz they paid the price.
                    Pursuit of excessive gratification or excessive pursuit of gratification (trying something unnatural for you) mean compromising on the higher layer of gratification.
                            eg - when too much of ego gratification becomes focus or trying out sth never before => lesser attention to spiritual layer.
                            trying out intellectual challenge builds your intellectual muscles but simultaneously starve the ego layer if you ain't focussed on the depth of 1 on that layer.
                            the same concept can be extended. That's where the power of MOG comes in vs MOP.
                                    even asuras (read MOP) can perform fabulously well at something cuz they pay the price - sometimes probably a little too much at that layer.
                                    MOP comes in with MOI in the package - who doesn't want some time to forget it all thru alcohol, etc and if not, then on other layers.

                    My Specialization is DS. Specialization (arch) is different from professionalism (engineer) in that specialist is a guide for professionals.
                            Professionals get excitement is making the ends meet, mapping from requirements to design implementation. May take full responsibility of a functional feature of the product.
                            Specialist focuses on feasibility, performance, scalability, flexibility, usability, functional completeness - basically if on a product, then taking full responsibility for it.
                    VA - Varna and Ashram form a pyramidal structure with base being the ashram and apex being the varna - there is no clear line of demarcation of where varna starts, but specialization is the whole track.
                            any level of existence, we start off with becoming a client, then focus should be on becoming a server and then making peers to do becoming and playing server more effectively.
                    grat is experienced in focus, full attention on some object with no side thought - fully immersed into something.
                            all SAP (Sambandh Abhidhyeya Prayojan) - all phases are gratifying. You don't experience grat when the engagement is just a means to an end - so "have to" mood. That's where scrum becomes important. So that in all engagement you go, I "want" it.
                            let tapasya be the way of life in all the layers - the pleasure will be experienced in immersion and in the rewards or fruits of engagement.
                            the ideal approach should be stretching yourself significantly on a layer (of course called tapasya but is a grat even in abhidhyeya) - then reward yourself with engagement (or tapasya) in lower layer.

                            Find out the role (in your field of interest) that you wanna target - read the job description (ego or identity) and make notes. This is the goal node.
                            Identify your current node - your resume and this needs to navigate to the goal node OR iow, your resume has to be the best match for the JD.
                                    Recruiter will need conviction at all BDJK levels

                                            you have all necessary knowledge (understanding) - reflects in architectural knowledge of what, why and how - bottom up.
                                            you have demonstrated in past (udna pudna) - reflects in projects you have done in the past.

                                            pick a topic to be written in resume
                                            understand it conceptually (why and how)
                                            code it (POC or hello world)
                                            build a case study or project which uses it.
                                            That's it!!
                    EQ - similarly - I have "social server" channel which is top down for Social Studies and also I have "Breathe Science" which is bottom up for Social Studies.
                            "customer of god" is purely for enjoyment.
                            Ashram is an ecosystem for mental stability. It is not just having wife, etc but the realm of social services and people with invoke them for and with.
                                    it includes friends, etc also.
                    Association (Util for PIES) - following is written with EQ in mind but applies very well to IQ as well.
                            About - Algo for Befriending (eliciting love) is association section of EQ.
                                    we have different levels of experiences of love 
                                            Stranger (only tags), Formal (client server relationship), Informal (Projects together as peers), Rapport (meeting without purposes), Oneness (family).
                                            Utils for Love - (1) raudra (anger), (2) adbhuta (wonder), (3) śṛṅgĿra (conjugal love), (4) hĿsya(comedy), (5) vīra (chivalry), (6) dayĿ (mercy), (7) dĿsya (servitorship), (8) sakhya (fraternity), (9) bhayĿnaka(horror), (10) bībhatsa (shock), (11) śĿnta (neutrality), (12) vĿtsalya (parenthood).
                            Algo for Formal (colleagues, stakeholder, etc)
                                    Do research on how the stuff works (web, people, etc)
                                    Get all necessary resources and get on the field.
                            Algo for informal relp (friends - fun when together)
                                    Be open to meeting new people - identify a set of "center of attraction" - NICE and any topic that makes you cluster together. Explore their PIES and store it.
                                    Do following
                                            B - Ask whereabouts whenever meeting.
                                            J - Extend discussion for exploration of the topic.
                                            D - Look for an opportunity of a project (peers and not client server but...) with them on an identified topic of interest.
                                            K - hear stories, make them open up about the past (EQ resume).
                            Algo for rapport (best friends - wanna be with them)
                                    This is more than just doing projects but empathizing with one another and genuinely interested in them as person not just topics they have interest in.
                                    have meals together (mutual sponsoring), exchange gifts - rapport. exchange brilliant discussions going in n-directions (not just topics of passion).
                                    taking up projects (outside of passion) like going grocery together, etc.
            PIES - Time Management - office (10-6 with skewed normal distribution sd = 0.5 hr) 
                    includes eth (discussion, meeting, project, bottom up for tasks, debugging, exploration) 
                    but personal accountability for every 2 hr window.
                    evening - current (concerns + needs); EQ.
                    morning - future (interests); SQ.
                    everything is stretchable (within limits and with priorities respected)
                            but everything else is respectable (bare minimum quota of eth)
            PIES - Gradient Descent in EQ 
                    Love is social aspect of EQ wrt to client server (and also peers)
                    Financial mgmt comes under IQ.
                    Recruitment in IQ means TME exchanges approval - in EQ somebody all levels across spectrum are TME exchanges growing.
                    we are always trying to maximize, our experience of and gratification thru service and love in PIES within material world.
                    Facebook can be a great help - sub folders formal known, tagged posts, news feed forwarded.
                    Material world mein le de ke hein yahi sab - people with anarthas but VA is the system that ensures that the conditionings are respected, engaged and purified while maximizing the gratification thru exercising spiritual proclivities in the material realm.
                    1 friend at SAP alleged that I was so selfish and he was right - not respecting association aspect of VA for service and love is selfishness.
                            does that mean good doers of VA are better off spiritually - not bluntly yes but the tendency is adorable - they may be still very much attracted to grats thru VA.
                            for advanced cessation is said to be the means. KC and VA dharma generally should feed together but little immaturity in the beginning is posssible and should not be a surprise.
                    Pange lo - ask for people's time for some fun activity - for gradient descent.
            PIES rituals or habits ensure you don't forget but bhagavat besides pancharatrika ensures that you remember
                    likewise the activities in PIES need to be done as rituals or standardizations but all those habits need to be carried out consciously else there can be repercussions.
                    REL you take a route that you generally take on NH leading to a penalty of 5 Km cuz you had to go somewhere else this time.
            PIES - IQ - Maximize Benefit:Effort ratio is the idea. Of course, opportunity cost and all the considerations but max the ratio for healthy IQ - this serves even SQ the best and promises max worldly enjoyments.
                    Extrinsic
                            The ratio is dynamic - so if at any point the ratio changes in favor of new discipline, gotta pay the necessary price for the benefits.
                                    even the migration is gradual and not sudden.
                                    The field starts to grow on you - in terms of that contributing to current field as innovations and personal projects in your free time.
                                    All the while you don't do injustice to the current and address all the concerns and needs, may not be the interest or interests only partially.
                            Try your best to not let the effort go waste - cuz already the effort of past gives you an edge in your line and makes you pro in the field.
                                    DS can be a tool in the toolkit at your disposal for CS. Even CS can be a tool in the toolkit at your disposal for DS.
                                    Changing it makes you newcomer there.
                            What's MOG and what's MOP - enjoyment of now vs steady happiness stream and not very demanding - which is better platform for KC?
                    Intrinsic
                            The rule is simple. Whatever you like doing among the options, just do that more.
                            it is based on the principle of pull taking over you and not pushing yourself.
                            So, the only question to ask is what would I rather be doing. Do that in your spare time. You can't resist doing that.
                    Current stand
                            Follow you bliss - maximise you streamline flow of IQ grats - Go with the intrinsic and pay attention to the extrinsic.
            PIES - IQ - Push system to its limits - eg - when will the VM crash - let's increase the load - first with forkbomb attack then our app.
            PIES - IQ - DO - Here, the entire focus is on tech, domain processes, specifics - DFDs. Just wrap your head around what manipulation yields the final result the best.
            PIES - IQ - Those who fail faster, win faster. So dare to fail. Incentive to improve comes from failure.
                    No point in preparation does a student say that he is 100% confident, it's just self evaluation and evolution.
                    others live in parties. Not that anyone prepares like UPSC for interviews. No1 does. It is just a healthy session of discussion.
                    at least that opportunity is missed, after cooling period (which hardly anyone cares) you get another chance. So don't worry.
            PIES - IQ - Micro-Economic progress is like looking for next break or cool set of tasks to solve.
                    So you enjoy your current work and pay attention to other stuff in your free time and look for opportunities that excite you.
                    of course, it should also excite them wrt you. So, excitement ain't blind but something you immediately wanna work on concretely not abstractly.
            PIES - for a given stimulus against eutopia, attitude can be - anger vs empathy.
            PIES - Realm is not just controlled by handful of concrete factors but also by some other factors like penance, price paid, etc.

	Solution - the limit is on file size and not on total cumulative size and hence break RA into 2 files and upload.
PIES - Master Phase means 2 things Regex and Hello World (In other words - standardized and story - engineer and arts)
    karma is transaction over standardized regex and experienced standardized simple story - wide and deep.
    Eg - u know yulu and u know bounce and you have a meeting to attend - you can make transaction using all of them cuz you have standardized them.
    vs config is simple. It is high level DMPM of PIES - it is mainly IO concerned whereas Master is RAM concerned.
    consultant thinks like config and arch thinks like master.
    config is ability to buy a car - what all does it take to buy it - what are your specification, etc.
    master is standardize a car in terms of its parts and standardize the process for completeness.
    Master is a phase of deep study for standardized BJDK.
    Config was phase of frameworks - abstracts, understanding syllabi
        eg like understanding scope of VA, how discussion works exploration, scrum of life, what do I want.
    Like studies, Config was Bhakti phase (scrum, scope syllabi, vision and means, study of eg or role models)
        Master will Dhyan phase (regex DMPM and Hello Worlds), Transactions will be karma phase.
        Then analytics phase will follow.
        This separation is not very strict
            like I have done lots of regex and HW in config phase also
            but those were all insights into it - showcasing genuine interest i.e bhakti.
    World Building - Story writing like movies and standardizations like a software are all world building
        just that 1 is execution trace to elicit emotions - the world building here can fall under different degrees of universe variants.
        and other is architectural completeness of pipeline or assembly line which will serve all - managerial in nature.
Logs - Story - Extremes - ear problems, skin itch and tongue no taste, smell in cold and eyes when tataiya bit.
SocialErp - Digilocker for all the documents.

    .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.
    When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.
    But, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.
    On OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.

    Kafka streaming in the GIT World directory - also has cql access.
CS - DStream works with RDD so avoided. pip install python spark kafka being external so using spark submit only.
    Standard documentation procedure and from udemy course works well - prefer directly in scala.
HomeErp - SCM Prod - Chakli karnataka made.
LIB - Scrum - what you want to be worked on, start talking about it
    where we are, what is next, any blockers, can anybody help, etc.
    Like Sunil, whenever any update is given, ask questions to help the person - nothing wrong with offering help.
LIB - url is jdbc:sap://127.0.0.1:30015/ - slash in the last also important - without chisel tunnel also it doesn't work - heck even ip is not approachable.
    of course you gotta be connected to vpn.

SQ - Complaint of why I got into that situation and gratitude of taking me out of that.
    Getting into situation is meant to be seen as karma - you don't like to see it that way is different thing but avaroh would like you to see it as that.
PIES - Happiness hunt
    Divisions of schools as follows
        all of them may peep out of the window but different approaches - study it, practice it with devotion, debate over it, enjoy it.
    Aaroh Jnana - Science, Sadhguru.
        objects of curiosity / jijnasa - explorers, travellers

        problem of local maxima? Like say drugs - well, a reasoning can take you out from there.
    Aaroh Bhakti - Devotion to standardized practices OR devotion to explorations
        standardized - worldly dharma, family traditions
        Exploration - course on yoga in goa.
        eth found within world - sr person, society, parents, country, whimsical worships - not scriptural
    Avaroh Karma - VA as guided - KY - Ladder of KK, SKY, NKY, YK.
    Avaroh Jnana - Veda Vakya Adhyayan.
    Avaroh Dhyana - Veda Vakyartha - Mimamsa - debating in light of scriptures.

IQ - appraisal depends not so much on power or desire but primarily on contributions - so keep backlogs in focus
    Money - point in normal distribution in market, within company, within team, personal expectations.
        market standards money - they are fixed and company already exists at a certain percentile.
            70 percentile not 70% - so 30% companies pay more than SAP but not that SAP pays 70% of them on average.
        internal fair compensation - within SAP I can take care.
            double digit increments of friends and compounding problem in initial years.
            mid year hike would have take care of that.
        Work satisfaction but money should not become bottleneck.
        you don't talk you don't get - demand.
    Power - plays a little role externally but only intrinsically - what is ur dependence
        Dependence - not talked about but is known.
        how team suffers in ur absence
        how many leads do you take
        how much help do you leverage to ur team members.
    Contributions - real thing
        number of backlogs or user stories, number of tickets, etc.
    Give development plan to Srini by EOM.
PIES - Make socializing as ur goal - ability to understand and suggest whatever anybody says.
    start attending all the meetings and adding things to your backlog - what all is going on
    refer to jira for what all is going on
    Besides this follow - "lapse upper limit once" (lulo) model.
PIES - create and maintain a world - vs live in a world aka story of VA MINUS V.
    Planning doing (in different buckets), delivering in different buckets
Logs - Story - Flexben clears after so many follow ups. HR channelled also.
    IDV negotiation. Car petrol fill and tyre inflation.

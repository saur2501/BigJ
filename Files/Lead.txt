SocialErp - ITR Filing -
    online tool for jpg to pdf, then doc embed images to pdf lesser but still more, then jpg to png to doc to pdf.
	Solution - the limit is on file size and not on total cumulative size and hence break RA into 2 files and upload.
PIES - Master Phase means 2 things Regex and Hello World (In other words - standardized and story - engineer and arts)
    karma is transaction over standardized regex and experienced standardized simple story - wide and deep.
    Eg - u know yulu and u know bounce and you have a meeting to attend - you can make transaction using all of them cuz you have standardized them.
    vs config is simple. It is high level DMPM of PIES - it is mainly IO concerned whereas Master is RAM concerned.
    consultant thinks like config and arch thinks like master.
    config is ability to buy a car - what all does it take to buy it - what are your specification, etc.
    master is standardize a car in terms of its parts and standardize the process for completeness.
    Master is a phase of deep study for standardized BJDK.
    Config was phase of frameworks - abstracts, understanding syllabi
        eg like understanding scope of VA, how discussion works exploration, scrum of life, what do I want.
    Like studies, Config was Bhakti phase (scrum, scope syllabi, vision and means, study of eg or role models)
        Master will Dhyan phase (regex DMPM and Hello Worlds), Transactions will be karma phase.
        Then analytics phase will follow.
        This separation is not very strict
            like I have done lots of regex and HW in config phase also
            but those were all insights into it - showcasing genuine interest i.e bhakti.
    World Building - Story writing like movies and standardizations like a software are all world building
        just that 1 is execution trace to elicit emotions - the world building here can fall under different degrees of universe variants.
        and other is architectural completeness of pipeline or assembly line which will serve all - managerial in nature.
Logs - Story - Extremes - ear problems, skin itch and tongue no taste, smell in cold and eyes when tataiya bit.

CS
    .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.
    When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.
    But, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.
    On OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.

SQ - Complaint of why I got into that situation and gratitude of taking me out of that.
    Getting into situation is meant to be seen as karma - you don't like to see it that way is different thing but avaroh would like you to see it as that.
PIES - Happiness hunt
    Divisions of schools as follows
        all of them may peep out of the window but different approaches - study it, practice it with devotion, debate over it, enjoy it.
    Aaroh Jnana - Science, Sadhguru.
        objects of curiosity / jijnasa - explorers, travellers
    Aaroh Dhyana - Debates and Discussions (ideologies)
        The arguments better be logical else e1 is free to think whatever they like.
    Aaroh Karma - Just VA for grats state or streaming - the path will reveal everything
        follow your bliss and you will get where it gets maximized. So, social contrib and social consumptions
        @share prices will dictate my behavior - rewards and punishments.
        problem of local maxima? Like say drugs - well, a reasoning can take you out from there.
    Aaroh Bhakti - Devotion to standardized practices OR devotion to explorations
        standardized - worldly dharma, family traditions
        Exploration - course on yoga in goa.
        eth found within world - sr person, society, parents, country, whimsical worships - not scriptural
    Avaroh Karma - VA as guided - KY - Ladder of KK, SKY, NKY, YK.
    Avaroh Jnana - Veda Vakya Adhyayan.
    Avaroh Dhyana - Veda Vakyartha - Mimamsa - debating in light of scriptures.
    Avaroh Bhakti - DS as guided by scriptures.
    Foreigners are better performers - cuz first of all we are using 2nd hand knowledge, applications, etc - not first hand
        next the culture which favor in past, present and future
        High cost and profit functions. Not other combinations 00, 01,10.

IQ - appraisal depends not so much on power or desire but primarily on contributions - so keep backlogs in focus
    Money - point in normal distribution in market, within company, within team, personal expectations.
        market standards money - they are fixed and company already exists at a certain percentile.
            70 percentile not 70% - so 30% companies pay more than SAP but not that SAP pays 70% of them on average.
        internal fair compensation - within SAP I can take care.
            double digit increments of friends and compounding problem in initial years.
            mid year hike would have take care of that.
        Work satisfaction but money should not become bottleneck.
        you don't talk you don't get - demand.
    Power - plays a little role externally but only intrinsically - what is ur dependence
        Dependence - not talked about but is known.
        how team suffers in ur absence
        how many leads do you take
        how much help do you leverage to ur team members.
    Contributions - real thing
        number of backlogs or user stories, number of tickets, etc.
    Give development plan to Srini by EOM.
PIES - Make socializing as ur goal - ability to understand and suggest whatever anybody says.
    start attending all the meetings and adding things to your backlog - what all is going on
    refer to jira for what all is going on
    Besides this follow - "lapse upper limit once" (lulo) model.
PIES - create and maintain a world - vs live in a world aka story of VA MINUS V.
    Planning doing (in different buckets), delivering in different buckets
Logs - Story - Flexben clears after so many follow ups. HR channelled also.
    IDV negotiation. Car petrol fill and tyre inflation.
CS - Mac - clicks on dock icons - shows different windows - full screeen means different desktop, full inside same desktop thru window double click
    Minimized means inactive, out of sight but passive, active, closed but daemon, quitted.
    switch spaces thru 3 fingers of ctrl+left arrow.
    window and control of windows are merged into command key and ctrl is just kept for extra. Option is similar to alt.
    ctrl+tab or ctrl+shift+tab or ctrl+` or ctrl+shift+` and also ctrl+` after ctrl+tab - read command in all these.
Logs - Story - We had VOIP on every workstation in Infy - those days. For talking to IT colleagues any time - this was besides Communicator.
PIES - The game of master will be self mastery and socializing in interest of max performance and productivity.
    config was DMPM and regex of eth - of course nth can be exhaustive but it has to be sufficient.
    You get paid for concrete karma in varna - not other things - concrete BJDK is all meant to assist K and scale K. And power comes from concrete karma only.
        Other things like J and D can only help.
        B4 thinking scaling of K which is transactional state
            master state will focus on how your personally disciplined and socially adept for performance and productivity of K.
            what you have already done is external standardizations but not personal self mastery.
            so what this means from spiritual perspective is the next master phase is about SB at slow pace (story centered) but most importantly applications in interest of self mastery.
            what are the keywords in master phase - fearless, effortless, socializing, self mastery.
            so what this means is that you are not an architect but you are a senior developer - you are the fastest, smartest person in the team.
            what this means is you can face public of 500 in a presentation.
NFP - contraceptives or Cndm - DPMPM to be organized - use case, features, why, how, wrt govt, etc.

        Withdraw after ejaculation or b4 losing erection. Hold rim to avoid sliding off.
        stop if too tight or too loose cuz then can lead to breakage.
        Lubes - as recommended - avoid oil based like jelly, baby oil, body lotions, massage oils, butter, margerine, etc.
Logs - Shaving cream at Kochi had Aloe.
CS - Macbook, pro and air - pro is considered the best with most configuration.
    Intro - Air is best for most. Pro 13 is Most speed for $, Pro 13 Premium is best for multitasking and Pro 16 inch is best for power users.
    Comparisons
        touchbar only in pro.
        2 TB for pro; Storage 4 TB for pro 13 premium; 10 for 16 Pro.
        Battery life is best or pro 13 16 hrs that is and 11 for pro 16.
        pro 16 is heaviest.
        Graphics M1 for air and pro 13. Intel for pro 13 premium and AMD Radeon Pro for pro 16.
        All thunderbolt ports - 2 for air and pro13. 4 for pro premium and pro 16.
        RAM 16 GB for air and pro13. 32 for pro premium and 64 for pro16.
        CPU M1 for and pro13. i7 10th Gen for pro premium and i7 9th Gen 2.6 GHz for pro16.
        air and pro13 are almost same with pro13 costs more (1K to 1.3K) - battery and weight difference.
        Magic Keyboard from air better than butterfly keyboard.
    Analytics
        Summary - Air is best for most. Pro 13 is Most speed for $, Pro 13 Premium is best for multitasking and Pro 16 inch is best for power users.
        pro13 premium adds on configuration for all the pro13 with 1.8K.
        pro16 adds on configs of pro13 premium and better battery with more weight and screen size.

PIES - SVAF - Another view is Professional life (V) and Personal Life (FSA) - partition day by 14-10 or 12-12 or whatever.
    study science and arts - primarily comes under ashram
    Foundation study (ABCD sources) - Character Qualities Beliefs Values (motivation; personal devp), Personality Behavior Relp (polity economics), Language, Scrum.
        Courses for - Intra-personal devp, Inter-personal devp, Means (lube) devp. Personal vision.
        Applications from science, arts, spirituality.
    Ashram Abstract Study - Science and Arts.
EQ - DMPM for Travelling somewhere OR Going outside - different granularities as follows (very important - there have lapse here in the past)
    Stay or purpose related requirements - gonna talk about abc. gotta finish xyz.
    Travel related requirements - going to travel A to B so need extra helmet, gotta have sweet box
    Personal completeness related requirements - wallet, charged phone, handkerchief, etc.
PIES - How our education has been a training ground for SVAF.
    Intermediate or prep after 10th is nth but preparation for specialization (professional courses)
    High School is foreshadowing of what's coming next - width view of life ahead
        Eg - PCMB while doing justice to the topic is also a width exploration of all engg disciplines.
    1st year of engg is glossary or glimpse of all the disciplines within engg (applied Science)
        with 1 subject being your own discipline for which every chapter is a future course (OS, DSA, SQL, etc)
    2nd and 3rd year are deep studies.
    4th year is again a glimpse into your master majors possible - you choose a set of electives to get a sneak peak
        not complete - like chapter-ize the courses in masters OR take a few pivotal courses among the gamut of courses.
    All courses are abstract and in India they need a little more application based approach with proper cost profit functions.
        our courses have always focussed on creating a world - architectural approach to building a thing yourself and not just being a consumer
        while being a consumer of every course is utter necessity - REL first you gotta understand shell, then think about coding an OS.
        every course is a world to be discussed in class for completeness of the world - how thorough is it, fast, performance, usable, etc.
    After that's done - every leaf of the schooling, is a service provider to a business (or enterprise, social admin included) or business (world) creator.
        what's a business after all schooling - bringing disciplines together
            eg - B2B making business run better thru Automation, Data Mining
            B2C - analytics at your home, home automation, etc.
        make ideas concrete if not done already - or add new features to them
            add a competitive flavor to the market with different usability, performance or features add ons.
        extend the ideas ahead with or without application
    All CS specializations create a world - done by architects.
        New apprentices do regular development (thru different consumptions) under them.
        World creators - architect for systems, architect for application, architect for data pipeline, architect for an innovative research idea.
    How am I distinguished, given my education
        I am a core CS expert - Researcher - Paper, patents, innovation.
            innovation lead or head (consuming all DS, Sys, AI, IOT, Maths, etc) in Apps Devp - can even quote or produce them if needed
        I am consumer of systems (distributed - kafka spark hadoop os shell) and know how the world has been created.
        I am consumer of DS - making models simpler ones or consuming deeply learned models.
        I am consumer of libraries, maths and other proposed ideas, papers, etc.
        So, hesitate with what comes your way - just align yourself and think how you can contribute to innovative side of the project
            world building is a desired quality.
            Any new project - do veni vidi vichi - then start your innovation business - try to get PDs for your innovation and not their regular work.
            I would even do that without PDs cuz hiring me is always the best bet or in best interest.
            I have done so many cross domain courses that world building isn't a big deal for me. Be it AI, Distributed computing, OS, DS, ML, DL, IOT.
            Attending courses is "my thing" cuz they are really innovation leads and know and explain well - the state of art.
    I get identified by my schools but also my peers - and let's not forget the off-site learning thru other channels.
        It's possible that I am a major in 1 school which may already be best in something but I would do courses in other schools to better other arms as well.
Logs - Story - Our director changes - fortunate to have Prof Sadagopan as our director - he was friend of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
    called for meeting and expressed his memories and then urged us to work extra on his demise day.
    Talking to him once would fill us with inspiration for working hard.
    Senior said that on his graduation day - the chief guest said I would rather work in his toilet - he is that kinda person.
CS - Swagger API - UXD of developers - such an excellence.
    Documentation for customers. for coders - GIT and wiki for archs.
PIES - Gotta harness FDDL to the fullest.
    Harness fear to the fullest
    have pressure - society imposed and personal imposed
    Scrum meet based pressure and pressure to perform well for next scrum and expectations from oneself.
    MMA of life.
    Not that you put yourself in pressure but you accept it for betterment
        not you put your situation to showcase anarthas but when you interact you will get see your shortcomings or others' shortcomings to empathize in sobriety.
    when you put yourself in association - shortcomings on foundational level also show up - like bad communication, bad behavioral abilities, not robust attitude, etc.
    Similarly gotta harness Desire - what's the reward - where are you at?
    Gotta harness duty - how much do you contribute in percentage? Comparisons and competitions.
    Gotta harness love - how much TME do you give it? Exclude 10 mins hourly breaks.
IQ - Presentations for power
    planning, design (sending MR), review (Code review and demo)
    for across team and new onboards - Demo mapping to planning, KT mapping to design, code walk through mapping to coding.
IQ
    In IQ, it's better to finish t tasks than to have all t+k tasks almost done.
    Manager or equivalent's polity - ask questions of next level - is it done, will it be done today, do you have PR today,
        whose help will you need to finish this, Mr X can you help him with this - this takes future work to present.
        Asking do you have PR even the details are enough to convey that it is far from it - intent is put pressure to raise PR.
        Now to ensure that you don't get pressure - get this thing brought out clearly that it is far from PR. So, your expectation is wrong here.
    Review meeting - What all was done and major decisions made. Demos.
        usability suggestions - how to organize the json response
        Potential problems - what if thresholds are reached with this design.
        usability - end user may get confusion if sees data in 2 places.
        how is it different from that endpoint.
        aesthetics - move url under that. response status be 400.
        Please remove that tag - I will check this and get back to you for the suggestion.
IQ - Revisit arch for Current State of the art.
    Clarify the question. If you can go to wiki page. Let me get time.
    Weekends for abstract J and concrete J. Revisit your J chakshu for runtime of what's being built - to reinforce your und.
    cleaning the things like making curl - standardizing and cleaning postman collections - making them dependable.
    so much achieved in 1 sprint. think from user perspective whats new. But things todo - better m simple things than m - k tough ones.
    brings clarity
    problems in new feature is a new plan. like thread pool exception. don't just correct it - fulfill a user story - every effort is a story.
    count them in appraisal
    program is tested and process is with soul. program compiling is recruitment. process is working in team.

SocialErp - Previous kings, samants, his appointed ministers are parallel to today's President, Governors, and ministers.
    only the protocols have changed over time to ensure that power doesn't get concentrated in 1 hand.
    President like those days had control over army but today the orders have to still go thru PM and cabinet.
    It's like king is obligated to go thru ministers.
    How kingdoms agreed to become states - not outta love but pressure.
    They suddenly become from namesake kings to owners and again only getting funds to maintain their lifestyles - which Indira removed.
    Britishers used to strike a deal with the state to accept themselves as central rule. So equivalent of today's center system governing n states.
    Britishers were just yet another rulers
        starting from East India company for business which gradually started expanding itself to villages.
        Once gaining sufficient power focus changed to maintaining business and expanding it along with expansion.
        1957 revolt made it very clear and they could not handle the administration and England Queen took charge of the administration which they had to comply.
        Suddenly viceroy (today's CEO) was removed and governor general was appointed to India.
        Now the queen equivalent of president would appoint a governor general for India and so many posts under him to administer India.
        They would recruit IAS from India also but they won't make to high posts for obvious reasons.
        Court systems existed with them but obviously highly biased to england personal interests - of course, constitution to suit whims.
        No public interest in mind (which to some degree runs parallel to even previous rulers) - but heavy taxes and rules run for personal grats.
            This can include forced to do farming of particular crop, run particular business cuz you are the government. So, incentive-ize as per your needs.
            like muslim rulers, jajiya to Hindus and not able to dress properly in streets - so yes the rulers were not just power hungry but also wanted to spread their belief system.
            of course, like previous kings, rebellions and revolts were handled harshly.
    Don't think that today's system is any different - it's just more organized.
        empires don't want to expand explicitly - although we do see eg of Tibet and many border fights. USSR division, etc.
        But countries want to create dependence. Interestingly Indians have become more clever who were gullible b4 to understand world political tactics to safeguard self interests.
        ministers still buy media (which is a stronger force today), courts do get manipulated - ministers may still be more intereted in making money from the positions, etc.
    Power concentration avoided - 3 Election commissioners every 2 years new added in a queue and 1 of them gets to be chief.
        so 6 year tenure ensures that only 1 gets to be Chief Election commissioner just once in their lifetime so can't manipulate much and numbers also help here
        elected by ruling opposition and SC.
    For practical purposes ministers should be thought of as public representative or even public or its voice.
        these representatives are the customers of the govt machinery which is admin block running govt services - Social ERP.
        Govt jobs isn't same as bureaucrats - latter are administrators of the govt machine - rules as delineated in constitution executors.
        active use case or instructions and demands come from the representatives.
        Creation and update is done thru bills or amendments - govt machine won't do anything outside the constitution.
        anybody inside or outside govt machine can approach courts if they think constitution is getting violated.
    History is primarily study of political life of those times - but arts, poetry, science, religion, etc also have history which is studied specifically or under civics.
        define current day civics in terms of all these things and trace all of them back thru time.
    USA political system are somewhat different from Indian political framework.
        federal constitutional democratic republic - Prez having power.
        Executive - Prez heads. Independent of legislative.
        Legislative - senate and house of representatives. Increased power here.
        Judicial - FC, federal. Wider scope of powers here.
    The major difference between a democracy and a republic is that a republic is a form of government whereas a democracy is an ideology that helps shape how a government is run.
        Put another way: a republic is the system of government that allows a country to be democratic!
PIES - Tapa by duration (days), tapa by intensity (in a day), tapa by investment - TME. Brahmaji told tapa. tapa is the difference maker.
    And of course that of past - called karma.
    Even why are demons able to outperform demigods sometimes - cuz of tapasya
    they may not align themselves to original intentions and plan but their willingness to pay the goddamn price is appreciated by Krishna.
IQData - Research
    How research works - a researcher doesn't know the full picture.
    Every individual piece of research is a DAG culminating into some potential for application.
    Like ICMR or CSIR has a vision for COVAXIN medicine development and is open to other ideas or lines of ideas.
        it is a body of government - must have started with 1 person entrusted with starting government funded research body in India.
            he further recruits more persons to delegate work in different sections to further the work.
            the ideas and topics are published on their website which universities professors can select or even propose.
            Once selected the profs or candidates may be recruited for fellowship to do justice to that topic of research.
    after the DAG of topics are fruitful - it culminates into COVAXIN medicine being made - this can be published for public consumption.
    in turn, business men can approach the govt body for recipes and permissions to start making the medicine as per specifications.
    Besides ICMR, there can funding done from companies - in foreign this practice is common but not so much in India.
    The developed mature ideas are shared across nations and not full theses - similar to company to keep tech secret or patents to get rights.
PIES - Scriptures or movies or science or any study be for applications as follows
    look at the crew - director, writer, actor and their intentions - thru story or otherwise.
        figure out the author - Mood, Mission, etc.
    Story - DAG of story and different points of views thru stories.
        look at the cast / actors - from story perspective what was their role. What they said or did and how justified was that - what different could be done.
        Figure the story out. See perspectives of characters.
    Look at the contents or world view presented thru a character - how justified the statement is.
        Sequencing the content, sheer content - FOE, Knowledge, Understanding, Content Reorganization.
        Figure out the content.
    Look at yourself - how it affects you. What you would do in that situation.
        Figure out the personal emotional changes - which part you liked the most.
        Personal Application in situations.
    Applications from all the different angles of visions.
        So, it's about stakeholders X {Application, Content} X {SVAF} X {Personal, Social, etc}
        SVAF includes social applications, personal applications, etc.
    BS Course - Look at presenters, story FOE, content (cast, conversations), Wisdom (Knowledge, Understanding)
        typical sequence is looking at these from right to left.
        Also, applications can be applied from right to left only. All of these end up being personal applications only.
        let's do these in iterations for applications perspective.
PIES - SVAF - PIES Server -
    Config is about identification of all possible execution traces (mark them as features) to be presented to users
        mark them as configs yes/no and ability to tweak.
    Master is about ability to effectively give an execution trace which is an independent unit in a humungous DAG or Graph.
        it is like in a software you have ability to write any individual module. OR like @in a program you know and can write any individual statement.
        It is about states and transitions mastery but not about FSM creation or event planning end to end with ability to delegate eth in hand at scale
    Transaction means you can do it all yourself but you better delegate individual consumable chunks to right people.
        Transaction is about being a shark or being the boss or guide - overseer and not doer of individual things.
    Analytics means ability to draw insights from your runs and other's runs.
    Current Plan
        Semester
            Now, this semester is about winding up the mastery over DMPM of SVAF.
            Master will be about Regex of eth. Transaction will be about DAG of individual components of mastery.
            Analytics will be reflections.
            What follows phase of PIES Server is beyond the current scope and can be developed with passage of time.
            My life is DAG of DAGs - like Avengers story - it's doing justice to the movie, the phase and the storyline thru those phases.
            So, doing justice to current work, individual SVAF, culminating SVAF into S or happiness.

CS - How CS things have grown over the years. This growth is somewhat natural flow of development also
    Time Traversal of CS growth over the years
        Hardware Time,
        Assembly / Language Time,
        OS Time,
        System Apps (compilers, editors, IDE) and Utilities (Word, excel, access or sql) Time,
        Applications Time,
        Networking Apps Time (EaaS movement) - With Tiers specialization
        Analytics Time
    See, how things  have grown over time - not that the previous ones see no development
        they do see it like OS on mobile, Hardware upgrades, SDN, Big Data Tools, microservices, etc.
        Emergence of new tech at any layers has brought about cascading changes below it - it is not layered exactly cuz it influences others as well.
        Innovation has always seen the problems faced by people and how to make it easier for others.
    SaaS - Business Specific (B2B), Consumers Specific (B2C) - all are technically the same thing but domain wise different - so different schema and and different management around the storage.
        Just different DM PM and technical differentiation based on details like nosql fits better than rdbms, etc.
        So for some it can be IOT Domain and due to its size it become big data problem and big data tools start to show up.
        making it schema agnostic is a powerful thing to do to cater to n customers.
CS - Spark Connection
    Local
    SSH into the remote clusters and use Spark shell on the remote cluster.
    downsample the data and pull the data to your laptop.
    Remote notebook on a cloud - zepplin, jupyter supported on cloud - but crashes and gotta download.
    Bridge local & remote spark - seamless with spark standalone but yarn gotta copy etc files to local spark - auth problem
    Jupyter notebook kernel called “Sparkmagic” - sends code to/from Spark cluster thru livy (possible to install thru ambari) - but installation, connection, and authentication issues
        sparkmagic introduces Docker containers to solve the problem of auth, installation, etc.
    Problems - other languages to run on cluster, scheduling the run.
        Set up a remote Jupyter server and SSH tunneling
        Set up a cron scheduler
        Set up Airflow
        Set up Kubeflow and other Kubernetes-based solutions
        Bayesnote is a notebook orchestration platform for Jupyter notebook:
    Others - PySpark Gateway.
CS - Auto-detect tabs in code styles to off. Tabs XML to tab size and indent set.

    Pattern - individual fights, grouped fights, hero groups. End goal is precise what public wants - so how to create a story around those wants.
        identify candidate triggers and all the flavors of presentations. PnC of eth.
EQ - Current days movies unfortunately focus on how to navigate ur ego thru social framework and not creating one.
Logs - Story - Udhampur Train jump. Missing train bombay. Drop from bus.
Logs - Talk to roomies about car.
EQ - Social layer is so important even if it's difficult I should do it - getting married - at least try it. If you have such temperament.
Logs - Trayambakeshvar - 1 of many jyotirlingas I have visited.
Logs - Story - Siemens Joke - BV is missing.
PIES - 4 lives only - SVAF - social production and consumption (VA) - happiness hunt (S) and personal stabilization (F)
SQ - Religions - mutually exclusive vs same one all. Offense - doubt broadcasted instead of clarified. Psych distancing of 1slf or itself OR mindless reasoning and justification.
    Prove vs improve.
EQ - Movies are powerful (cuz psychological mirroring) - cuz kafka topic - if you subscribe to it - you get streamo f value judgments.
    on all other topics - share prices - thru expressing doubts of topics, praising some topics, adv confusions, etc - so is newspaper editorials, etc.
PIES - 3 tiers - personal, social, trans - some atheists think remove trans => More focus on VA and personal.
     Good performers there also - applications of trans on VAF but not hard add-ons - cuz FDDL takes care.
     What about drawbacks of trans - are they mis-applications of bad results really
     Trans not just personal ideologies but also social ideologies. Happiness hunt - at personal and universal level, social included.
     Spiritual frameworks - personal frameworks - beliefs, values, etc.
SQ - why are they "enlightened". What if they are not - in aaroh pantha - we don't think they are - just become a subscriber with assumption.
    Not closed to inputs from others ppl.
    Even VAF is based on a happiness hunt premise. We run, be grateful, study, tech, play cuz we think there's bliss.
SQ - Aaroh pantha - KY is equivalent of VA in aaroh pantha - growth along this also takes you to perfection slowly though.
    How? By taking MOP / MOI to MOG - on a layer for the sake of MOP of higher layer.
    Maya is in  laws of material nature - external or internal - shiva durga controllers so important worship here in material world ppl do.
    Krishna is passive controller or controller or controllers - yes he is passive controller - cuz active controllers are shiva and durga that's why shaktas and shivites.
Logs - Story - I chanted a round in front of prasadam plate.
Logs - Story - Tell cab driver in kochi to come and collect us from next beach - 50% rent is worth a try and it worked.
SQ - Share our good fortune - if nothing greater than this - I ain't doing wishy washy stuff - I've to get perfection for every endeavor I do.
SQ - Material world is for grats - no, for purification.
PIES - VA for social satisfaction - foundation for platform - utils for stable and healthy base.
    Sp/Tran/Truth for purpose of happiness - KC proposes love as highest prayojan in the Framework. // across scripures - avaroh but dictionary sizes different.
    aaroh also has frameworks - like multiverse, theory of relativity, etc.
PIES - Individual egos are dangerous until all of them believe in a society - VA.
    Eg - goons if believe in society then can give power as a service (PaaS).
    else it'll use power to exploit - but biz guy can hire goons to fight back.
    or lure max protection offering guy a little favor in return of protection from others - government is that.
Logs - Story - tried bounce in Bangalore. Also tried Yulu bikes - without risk we can't standardize something potentially useful.
Logs - Story - car insurance - parked car inside was taken out thru maneuvering and luckily guard had no problem else without sticker it could be.
    Learning the insurance intricacies when needed - call and have questions ready.
PIES - BJDK phases translate into DM, PM, Regex and Hello world to sprints.
LIB - Ashok is into Quality, Space management, Product procurement or SPC works.
EQ - why marry
    C - Social status, well being, boredom of no1 to share sth with, practically worldly probs (illness), no high maintenance
        avoid opposites - like miser spendthrift
    N - social awareness, mundane PS together (cooking, foods, luxuries), udna pudna (work things out like camera, installation, worldly problem solving)
    I - different emotions, different worldly experiences - explorations, adventure, sight seeing.
    PIES - HVAS or SVAF - All have bearing on others. So Varna - politics
        #1 company award. voice - great performers, etc. but secondary not primary considerations - important though.
        +1 be addressed in worldly considerations though also.
EQ - Marriage Portal
    Preferences - CC, edu, state, current resi (high maintenance), height, age (relatable), religion (relatable and has bearing)
        earning (social status), lang (no barrier), pets (high maintenance).
    Description+Photo+Families - hobbies in free time, pursuits, lifestyle - dressings, lang, alcohol. Cultured. Likeness.
    Chat; vid chat - subjective verification about truthfulness. truthful; experience grade on scale of 1 to 10.
    F2F - B2G, B'2G, B2G', B'2G', B''2G''.
        Face levels - excavate values, beliefs, case studies, nature, temperament, tolerance, fun loving, pursuits, ambitions.
    Describe adjectives for self and partner - values, some history, current State of the art of family.
SQ - it's always selfish. Point is where the selfishness is best served - be intel selfish.
    greatest selfish interest is in selfless love - but can't be explicit about it. pursuit is friendship - uanalysis is the undercurrent.
    it's obvious but it's formal and exciting.
PIES - 2 targets - 1 to be teacher - DMPM for all YT channels and other social media - anything helpful.
    2. Resume for all - enrichment.
    I've done PIES b4 but for grats streaming and not for social grats, now that is the focus.
    Config to master to transaction - config = standardize = health + DMPM + abstracts - foundation + DMPM + abstracts.
PIES - Foundation = HAS - Health, Abstract (PIES and indiv), scrum.
PIES - meta for goal setting
    About
        B4 making goals - let's study what should be goals.
        kernel - begin with the end result in mind - go and get it - ask and it is given, knock on the doors and they open. Layers + BJDK.
    Varna Goal and use cases
        spiritual seva, social seva - excellent interactions, worthy of designations. logs of grats and lapse while achievements, huge returns or money or rewards.
    Ashram goals
        spiritual general seva not specialized. Social interactions with family and world.
        sume of experiences.
        stories and logs. Best streaming like foreign fun.
    Spiritual goals
        Preach, help s.t ease of DS, sume of courses and achievements - wha tall is done.
        Stories, ecstasies and logs, best streaming - fun bhajans.
    Foundation
        health for seva (like vessel lifting), health for others.
        sume of health efforts, stories / challenges / logs, fun of it.
SQ - goal ain't NFP but brahmacarya. life of continence. Oj, Tej, JY, etc.
    What if's - lies I know; DY will take care of me.
    If trade-offs then I'd rather choose shreyas of yoga (or at least worth taking risk).
PIES - incentives for all classes of people
    Power
        Physical, desirable / abhor / like, science / orchestration / i/f management, reasonsing, position, numbers
        alliance / partners
        All layer serving the chess game of power - character / competence ; guna or karma.

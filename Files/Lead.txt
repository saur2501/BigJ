SocialErp - ITR Filing -
    online tool for jpg to pdf, then doc embed images to pdf lesser but still more, then jpg to png to doc to pdf.
	Solution - the limit is on file size and not on total cumulative size and hence break RA into 2 files and upload.
PIES - Master Phase means 2 things Regex and Hello World (In other words - standardized and story - engineer and arts)
    karma is transaction over standardized regex and experienced standardized simple story - wide and deep.
    Eg - u know yulu and u know bounce and you have a meeting to attend - you can make transaction using all of them cuz you have standardized them.
    vs config is simple. It is high level DMPM of PIES - it is mainly IO concerned whereas Master is RAM concerned.
    consultant thinks like config and arch thinks like master.
    config is ability to buy a car - what all does it take to buy it - what are your specification, etc.
    master is standardize a car in terms of its parts and standardize the process for completeness.
    Master is a phase of deep study for standardized BJDK.
    Config was phase of frameworks - abstracts, understanding syllabi
        eg like understanding scope of VA, how discussion works exploration, scrum of life, what do I want.
    Like studies, Config was Bhakti phase (scrum, scope syllabi, vision and means, study of eg or role models)
        Master will Dhyan phase (regex DMPM and Hello Worlds), Transactions will be karma phase.
        Then analytics phase will follow.
        This separation is not very strict
            like I have done lots of regex and HW in config phase also
            but those were all insights into it - showcasing genuine interest i.e bhakti.
    World Building - Story writing like movies and standardizations like a software are all world building
        just that 1 is execution trace to elicit emotions - the world building here can fall under different degrees of universe variants.
        and other is architectural completeness of pipeline or assembly line which will serve all - managerial in nature.
Logs - Story - Extremes - ear problems, skin itch and tongue no taste, smell in cold and eyes when tataiya bit.

CS
    .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.
    When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.
    But, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.
    On OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.

SQ - Complaint of why I got into that situation and gratitude of taking me out of that.
    Getting into situation is meant to be seen as karma - you don't like to see it that way is different thing but avaroh would like you to see it as that.
PIES - Happiness hunt
    Divisions of schools as follows
        all of them may peep out of the window but different approaches - study it, practice it with devotion, debate over it, enjoy it.
    Aaroh Jnana - Science, Sadhguru.
        objects of curiosity / jijnasa - explorers, travellers
    Aaroh Dhyana - Debates and Discussions (ideologies)
        The arguments better be logical else e1 is free to think whatever they like.
    Aaroh Karma - Just VA for grats state or streaming - the path will reveal everything
        follow your bliss and you will get where it gets maximized. So, social contrib and social consumptions
        @share prices will dictate my behavior - rewards and punishments.
        problem of local maxima? Like say drugs - well, a reasoning can take you out from there.
    Aaroh Bhakti - Devotion to standardized practices OR devotion to explorations
        standardized - worldly dharma, family traditions
        Exploration - course on yoga in goa.
        eth found within world - sr person, society, parents, country, whimsical worships - not scriptural
    Avaroh Karma - VA as guided - KY - Ladder of KK, SKY, NKY, YK.
    Avaroh Jnana - Veda Vakya Adhyayan.
    Avaroh Dhyana - Veda Vakyartha - Mimamsa - debating in light of scriptures.
    Avaroh Bhakti - DS as guided by scriptures.
    Foreigners are better performers - cuz first of all we are using 2nd hand knowledge, applications, etc - not first hand
        next the culture which favor in past, present and future
        High cost and profit functions. Not other combinations 00, 01,10.

IQ - appraisal depends not so much on power or desire but primarily on contributions - so keep backlogs in focus
    Money - point in normal distribution in market, within company, within team, personal expectations.
        market standards money - they are fixed and company already exists at a certain percentile.
            70 percentile not 70% - so 30% companies pay more than SAP but not that SAP pays 70% of them on average.
        internal fair compensation - within SAP I can take care.
            double digit increments of friends and compounding problem in initial years.
            mid year hike would have take care of that.
        Work satisfaction but money should not become bottleneck.
        you don't talk you don't get - demand.
    Power - plays a little role externally but only intrinsically - what is ur dependence
        Dependence - not talked about but is known.
        how team suffers in ur absence
        how many leads do you take
        how much help do you leverage to ur team members.
    Contributions - real thing
        number of backlogs or user stories, number of tickets, etc.
    Give development plan to Srini by EOM.
PIES - Make socializing as ur goal - ability to understand and suggest whatever anybody says.
    start attending all the meetings and adding things to your backlog - what all is going on
    refer to jira for what all is going on
    Besides this follow - "lapse upper limit once" (lulo) model.
PIES - create and maintain a world - vs live in a world aka story of VA MINUS V.
    Planning doing (in different buckets), delivering in different buckets
Logs - Story - Flexben clears after so many follow ups. HR channelled also.
    IDV negotiation. Car petrol fill and tyre inflation.
CS - Mac - clicks on dock icons - shows different windows - full screeen means different desktop, full inside same desktop thru window double click
    Minimized means inactive, out of sight but passive, active, closed but daemon, quitted.
    switch spaces thru 3 fingers of ctrl+left arrow.
    window and control of windows are merged into command key and ctrl is just kept for extra. Option is similar to alt.
    ctrl+tab or ctrl+shift+tab or ctrl+` or ctrl+shift+` and also ctrl+` after ctrl+tab - read command in all these.
Logs - Story - We had VOIP on every workstation in Infy - those days. For talking to IT colleagues any time - this was besides Communicator.
PIES - The game of master will be self mastery and socializing in interest of max performance and productivity.
    config was DMPM and regex of eth - of course nth can be exhaustive but it has to be sufficient.
    You get paid for concrete karma in varna - not other things - concrete BJDK is all meant to assist K and scale K. And power comes from concrete karma only.
        Other things like J and D can only help.
        B4 thinking scaling of K which is transactional state
            master state will focus on how your personally disciplined and socially adept for performance and productivity of K.
            what you have already done is external standardizations but not personal self mastery.
            so what this means from spiritual perspective is the next master phase is about SB at slow pace (story centered) but most importantly applications in interest of self mastery.
            what are the keywords in master phase - fearless, effortless, socializing, self mastery.
            so what this means is that you are not an architect but you are a senior developer - you are the fastest, smartest person in the team.
            what this means is you can face public of 500 in a presentation.
NFP - contraceptives or Cndm - DPMPM to be organized - use case, features, why, how, wrt govt, etc.

        Withdraw after ejaculation or b4 losing erection. Hold rim to avoid sliding off.
        stop if too tight or too loose cuz then can lead to breakage.
        Lubes - as recommended - avoid oil based like jelly, baby oil, body lotions, massage oils, butter, margerine, etc.
Logs - Shaving cream at Kochi had Aloe.
CS - Macbook, pro and air - pro is considered the best with most configuration.
    Intro - Air is best for most. Pro 13 is Most speed for $, Pro 13 Premium is best for multitasking and Pro 16 inch is best for power users.
    Comparisons
        touchbar only in pro.
        2 TB for pro; Storage 4 TB for pro 13 premium; 10 for 16 Pro.
        Battery life is best or pro 13 16 hrs that is and 11 for pro 16.
        pro 16 is heaviest.
        Graphics M1 for air and pro 13. Intel for pro 13 premium and AMD Radeon Pro for pro 16.
        All thunderbolt ports - 2 for air and pro13. 4 for pro premium and pro 16.
        RAM 16 GB for air and pro13. 32 for pro premium and 64 for pro16.
        CPU M1 for and pro13. i7 10th Gen for pro premium and i7 9th Gen 2.6 GHz for pro16.
        air and pro13 are almost same with pro13 costs more (1K to 1.3K) - battery and weight difference.
        Magic Keyboard from air better than butterfly keyboard.
    Analytics
        Summary - Air is best for most. Pro 13 is Most speed for $, Pro 13 Premium is best for multitasking and Pro 16 inch is best for power users.
        pro13 premium adds on configuration for all the pro13 with 1.8K.
        pro16 adds on configs of pro13 premium and better battery with more weight and screen size.

PIES - SVAF - Another view is Professional life (V) and Personal Life (FSA) - partition day by 14-10 or 12-12 or whatever.
    study science and arts - primarily comes under ashram
    Foundation study (ABCD sources) - Character Qualities Beliefs Values (motivation; personal devp), Personality Behavior Relp (polity economics), Language, Scrum.
        Courses for - Intra-personal devp, Inter-personal devp, Means (lube) devp. Personal vision.
        Applications from science, arts, spirituality.
    Ashram Abstract Study - Science and Arts.
EQ - DMPM for Travelling somewhere OR Going outside - different granularities as follows (very important - there have lapse here in the past)
    Stay or purpose related requirements - gonna talk about abc. gotta finish xyz.
    Travel related requirements - going to travel A to B so need extra helmet, gotta have sweet box
    Personal completeness related requirements - wallet, charged phone, handkerchief, etc.
PIES - How our education has been a training ground for SVAF.
    Intermediate or prep after 10th is nth but preparation for specialization (professional courses)
    High School is foreshadowing of what's coming next - width view of life ahead
        Eg - PCMB while doing justice to the topic is also a width exploration of all engg disciplines.
    1st year of engg is glossary or glimpse of all the disciplines within engg (applied Science)
        with 1 subject being your own discipline for which every chapter is a future course (OS, DSA, SQL, etc)
    2nd and 3rd year are deep studies.
    4th year is again a glimpse into your master majors possible - you choose a set of electives to get a sneak peak
        not complete - like chapter-ize the courses in masters OR take a few pivotal courses among the gamut of courses.
    All courses are abstract and in India they need a little more application based approach with proper cost profit functions.
        our courses have always focussed on creating a world - architectural approach to building a thing yourself and not just being a consumer
        while being a consumer of every course is utter necessity - REL first you gotta understand shell, then think about coding an OS.
        every course is a world to be discussed in class for completeness of the world - how thorough is it, fast, performance, usable, etc.
    After that's done - every leaf of the schooling, is a service provider to a business (or enterprise, social admin included) or business (world) creator.
        what's a business after all schooling - bringing disciplines together
            eg - B2B making business run better thru Automation, Data Mining
            B2C - analytics at your home, home automation, etc.
        make ideas concrete if not done already - or add new features to them
            add a competitive flavor to the market with different usability, performance or features add ons.
        extend the ideas ahead with or without application
    All CS specializations create a world - done by architects.
        New apprentices do regular development (thru different consumptions) under them.
        World creators - architect for systems, architect for application, architect for data pipeline, architect for an innovative research idea.
    How am I distinguished, given my education
        I am a core CS expert - Researcher - Paper, patents, innovation.
            innovation lead or head (consuming all DS, Sys, AI, IOT, Maths, etc) in Apps Devp - can even quote or produce them if needed
        I am consumer of systems (distributed - kafka spark hadoop os shell) and know how the world has been created.
        I am consumer of DS - making models simpler ones or consuming deeply learned models.
        I am consumer of libraries, maths and other proposed ideas, papers, etc.
        So, hesitate with what comes your way - just align yourself and think how you can contribute to innovative side of the project
            world building is a desired quality.
            Any new project - do veni vidi vichi - then start your innovation business - try to get PDs for your innovation and not their regular work.
            I would even do that without PDs cuz hiring me is always the best bet or in best interest.
            I have done so many cross domain courses that world building isn't a big deal for me. Be it AI, Distributed computing, OS, DS, ML, DL, IOT.
            Attending courses is "my thing" cuz they are really innovation leads and know and explain well - the state of art.
    I get identified by my schools but also my peers - and let's not forget the off-site learning thru other channels.
        It's possible that I am a major in 1 school which may already be best in something but I would do courses in other schools to better other arms as well.
Logs - Story - Our director changes - fortunate to have Prof Sadagopan as our director - he was friend of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
    called for meeting and expressed his memories and then urged us to work extra on his demise day.
    Talking to him once would fill us with inspiration for working hard.
    Senior said that on his graduation day - the chief guest said I would rather work in his toilet - he is that kinda person.
CS - Swagger API - UXD of developers - such an excellence.
    Documentation for customers. for coders - GIT and wiki for archs.
PIES - Gotta harness FDDL to the fullest.
    Harness fear to the fullest
    have pressure - society imposed and personal imposed
    Scrum meet based pressure and pressure to perform well for next scrum and expectations from oneself.
    MMA of life.
    Not that you put yourself in pressure but you accept it for betterment
        not you put your situation to showcase anarthas but when you interact you will get see your shortcomings or others' shortcomings to empathize in sobriety.
    when you put yourself in association - shortcomings on foundational level also show up - like bad communication, bad behavioral abilities, not robust attitude, etc.
    Similarly gotta harness Desire - what's the reward - where are you at?
    Gotta harness duty - how much do you contribute in percentage? Comparisons and competitions.
    Gotta harness love - how much TME do you give it? Exclude 10 mins hourly breaks.
IQ - Presentations for power
    planning, design (sending MR), review (Code review and demo)
    for across team and new onboards - Demo mapping to planning, KT mapping to design, code walk through mapping to coding.
IQ
    In IQ, it's better to finish t tasks than to have all t+k tasks almost done.
    Manager or equivalent's polity - ask questions of next level - is it done, will it be done today, do you have PR today,
        whose help will you need to finish this, Mr X can you help him with this - this takes future work to present.
        Asking do you have PR even the details are enough to convey that it is far from it - intent is put pressure to raise PR.
        Now to ensure that you don't get pressure - get this thing brought out clearly that it is far from PR. So, your expectation is wrong here.
    Review meeting - What all was done and major decisions made. Demos.
        usability suggestions - how to organize the json response
        Potential problems - what if thresholds are reached with this design.
        usability - end user may get confusion if sees data in 2 places.
        how is it different from that endpoint.
        aesthetics - move url under that. response status be 400.
        Please remove that tag - I will check this and get back to you for the suggestion.
IQ - Revisit arch for Current State of the art.
    Clarify the question. If you can go to wiki page. Let me get time.

SocialErp - Previous kings, samants, his appointed ministers are parallel to today's President, Governors, and ministers.
    only the protocols have changed over time to ensure that power doesn't get concentrated in 1 hand.
    President like those days had control over army but today the orders have to still go thru PM and cabinet.
    It's like king is obligated to go thru ministers.
    How kingdoms agreed to become states - not outta love but pressure.
    They suddenly become from namesake kings to owners and again only getting funds to maintain their lifestyles - which Indira removed.
    Britishers used to strike a deal with the state to accept themselves as central rule. So equivalent of today's center system governing n states.
    Britishers were just yet another rulers
        starting from East India company for business which gradually started expanding itself to villages.
        Once gaining sufficient power focus changed to maintaining business and expanding it along with expansion.
        1957 revolt made it very clear and they could not handle the administration and England Queen took charge of the administration which they had to comply.
        Suddenly viceroy (today's CEO) was removed and governor general was appointed to India.
        Now the queen equivalent of president would appoint a governor general for India and so many posts under him to administer India.
        They would recruit IAS from India also but they won't make to high posts for obvious reasons.
        Court systems existed with them but obviously highly biased to england personal interests - of course, constitution to suit whims.
        No public interest in mind (which to some degree runs parallel to even previous rulers) - but heavy taxes and rules run for personal grats.
            This can include forced to do farming of particular crop, run particular business cuz you are the government. So, incentive-ize as per your needs.
            like muslim rulers, jajiya to Hindus and not able to dress properly in streets - so yes the rulers were not just power hungry but also wanted to spread their belief system.
            of course, like previous kings, rebellions and revolts were handled harshly.
    Don't think that today's system is any different - it's just more organized.
        empires don't want to expand explicitly - although we do see eg of Tibet and many border fights. USSR division, etc.
        But countries want to create dependence. Interestingly Indians have become more clever who were gullible b4 to understand world political tactics to safeguard self interests.
        ministers still buy media (which is a stronger force today), courts do get manipulated - ministers may still be more intereted in making money from the positions, etc.
    Power concentration avoided - 3 Election commissioners every 2 years new added in a queue and 1 of them gets to be chief.
        so 6 year tenure ensures that only 1 gets to be Chief Election commissioner just once in their lifetime so can't manipulate much and numbers also help here
        elected by ruling opposition and SC.
    For practical purposes ministers should be thought of as public representative or even public or its voice.
        these representatives are the customers of the govt machinery which is admin block running govt services - Social ERP.
        Govt jobs isn't same as bureaucrats - latter are administrators of the govt machine - rules as delineated in constitution executors.
        active use case or instructions and demands come from the representatives.
        Creation and update is done thru bills or amendments - govt machine won't do anything outside the constitution.
        anybody inside or outside govt machine can approach courts if they think constitution is getting violated.
    History is primarily study of political life of those times - but arts, poetry, science, religion, etc also have history which is studied specifically or under civics.
        define current day civics in terms of all these things and trace all of them back thru time.
    USA political system are somewhat different from Indian political framework.
        federal constitutional democratic republic - Prez having power.
        Executive - Prez heads. Independent of legislative.
        Legislative - senate and house of representatives. Increased power here.
        Judicial - FC, federal. Wider scope of powers here.
    The major difference between a democracy and a republic is that a republic is a form of government whereas a democracy is an ideology that helps shape how a government is run.
        Put another way: a republic is the system of government that allows a country to be democratic!
PIES - Tapa by duration (days), tapa by intensity (in a day), tapa by investment - TME. Brahmaji told tapa. tapa is the difference maker.
    And of course that of past - called karma.
    Even why are demons able to outperform demigods sometimes - cuz of tapasya
    they may not align themselves to original intentions and plan but their willingness to pay the goddamn price is appreciated by Krishna.
IQData - Research
    How research works - a researcher doesn't know the full picture.
    Every individual piece of research is a DAG culminating into some potential for application.
    Like ICMR or CSIR has a vision for COVAXIN medicine development and is open to other ideas or lines of ideas.
        it is a body of government - must have started with 1 person entrusted with starting government funded research body in India.
            he further recruits more persons to delegate work in different sections to further the work.
            the ideas and topics are published on their website which universities professors can select or even propose.
            Once selected the profs or candidates may be recruited for fellowship to do justice to that topic of research.
    after the DAG of topics are fruitful - it culminates into COVAXIN medicine being made - this can be published for public consumption.
    in turn, business men can approach the govt body for recipes and permissions to start making the medicine as per specifications.
    Besides ICMR, there can funding done from companies - in foreign this practice is common but not so much in India.
    The developed mature ideas are shared across nations and not full theses - similar to company to keep tech secret or patents to get rights.
PIES - Scriptures or movies or science or any study be for applications as follows
    look at the crew - director, writer, actor and their intentions - thru story or otherwise.
        figure out the author - Mood, Mission, etc.
    Story - DAG of story and different points of views thru stories.
        look at the cast / actors - from story perspective what was their role. What they said or did and how justified was that - what different could be done.
        Figure the story out. See perspectives of characters.
    Look at the contents or world view presented thru a character - how justified the statement is.
        Sequencing the content, sheer content - FOE, Knowledge, Understanding, Content Reorganization.
        Figure out the content.
    Look at yourself - how it affects you. What you would do in that situation.
        Figure out the personal emotional changes - which part you liked the most.
        Personal Application in situations.
    Applications from all the different angles of visions.
        So, it's about stakeholders X {Application, Content} X {SVAF} X {Personal, Social, etc}
        SVAF includes social applications, personal applications, etc.
    BS Course - Look at presenters, story FOE, content (cast, conversations), Wisdom (Knowledge, Understanding)
        typical sequence is looking at these from right to left.
        Also, applications can be applied from right to left only. All of these end up being personal applications only.
        let's do these in iterations for applications perspective.
PIES - SVAF - PIES Server -
    Config is about identification of all possible execution traces (mark them as features) to be presented to users
        mark them as configs yes/no and ability to tweak.
    Master is about ability to effectively give an execution trace which is an independent unit in a humungous DAG or Graph.
        it is like in a software you have ability to write any individual module. OR like @in a program you know and can write any individual statement.
        It is about states and transitions mastery but not about FSM creation or event planning end to end with ability to delegate eth in hand at scale
    Transaction means you can do it all yourself but you better delegate individual consumable chunks to right people.
        Transaction is about being a shark or being the boss or guide - overseer and not doer of individual things.
    Analytics means ability to draw insights from your runs and other's runs.
    Current Plan
        Semester
            Now, this semester is about winding up the mastery over DMPM of SVAF.
            Master will be about Regex of eth. Transaction will be about DAG of individual components of mastery.
            Analytics will be reflections.
            What follows phase of PIES Server is beyond the current scope and can be developed with passage of time.
            My life is DAG of DAGs - like Avengers story - it's doing justice to the movie, the phase and the storyline thru those phases.
            So, doing justice to current work, individual SVAF, culminating SVAF into S or happiness.
        Month - Psychology, Winning friends, Spring, Spark Kafka windup, Communication Patterns, Exercise, BG BY + JY.
CS - How CS things have grown over the years. This growth is somewhat natural flow of development also
    Time Traversal of CS growth over the years
        Hardware Time,
        Assembly / Language Time,
        OS Time,
        System Apps (compilers, editors, IDE) and Utilities (Word, excel, access or sql) Time,
        Applications Time,
        Networking Apps Time (EaaS movement) - With Tiers specialization
        Analytics Time
    See, how things  have grown over time - not that the previous ones see no development
        they do see it like OS on mobile, Hardware upgrades, SDN, Big Data Tools, microservices, etc.
        Emergence of new tech at any layers has brought about cascading changes below it - it is not layered exactly cuz it influences others as well.
        Innovation has always seen the problems faced by people and how to make it easier for others.
    SaaS - Business Specific (B2B), Consumers Specific (B2C) - all are technically the same thing but domain wise different - so different schema and and different management around the storage.
        Just different DM PM and technical differentiation based on details like nosql fits better than rdbms, etc.
        So for some it can be IOT Domain and due to its size it become big data problem and big data tools start to show up.
        making it schema agnostic is a powerful thing to do to cater to n customers.

        Horror based - Green Goblin, hobgoblin, Morbious, Symbiotes (Aliens)
        Others - Craven, Shocker.
    Pattern - individual fights, grouped fights, hero groups. End goal is precise what public wants - so how to create a story around those wants.
        identify candidate triggers and all the flavors of presentations. PnC of eth.
EQ - Current days movies unfortunately focus on how to navigate ur ego thru social framework and not creating one.
Logs - Story - Udhampur Train jump. Missing train bombay. Drop from bus.
Logs - Talk to roomies about car.
EQ - Social layer is so important even if it's difficult I should do it - getting married - at least try it. If you have such temperament.
Logs - Trayambakeshvar - 1 of many jyotirlingas I have visited.
Logs - Story - Siemens Joke - BV is missing.
PIES - 4 lives only - SVAF - social production and consumption (VA) - happiness hunt (S) and personal stabilization (F)
SQ - Religions - mutually exclusive vs same one all. Offense - doubt broadcasted instead of clarified. Psych distancing of 1slf or itself OR mindless reasoning and justification.
    Prove vs improve.
EQ - Movies are powerful (cuz psychological mirroring) - cuz kafka topic - if you subscribe to it - you get streamo f value judgments.
    on all other topics - share prices - thru expressing doubts of topics, praising some topics, adv confusions, etc - so is newspaper editorials, etc.
PIES - 3 tiers - personal, social, trans - some atheists think remove trans => More focus on VA and personal.
     Good performers there also - applications of trans on VAF but not hard add-ons - cuz FDDL takes care.
     What about drawbacks of trans - are they mis-applications of bad results really
     Trans not just personal ideologies but also social ideologies. Happiness hunt - at personal and universal level, social included.
     Spiritual frameworks - personal frameworks - beliefs, values, etc.
SQ - why are they "enlightened". What if they are not - in aaroh pantha - we don't think they are - just become a subscriber with assumption.
    Not closed to inputs from others ppl.
    Even VAF is based on a happiness hunt premise. We run, be grateful, study, tech, play cuz we think there's bliss.
SQ - Aaroh pantha - KY is equivalent of VA in aaroh pantha - growth along this also takes you to perfection slowly though.
    How? By taking MOP / MOI to MOG - on a layer for the sake of MOP of higher layer.
    Maya is in  laws of material nature - external or internal - shiva durga controllers so important worship here in material world ppl do.
    Krishna is passive controller or controller or controllers - yes he is passive controller - cuz active controllers are shiva and durga that's why shaktas and shivites.
Logs - Story - I chanted a round in front of prasadam plate.
Logs - Story - Tell cab driver in kochi to come and collect us from next beach - 50% rent is worth a try and it worked.
SQ - Share our good fortune - if nothing greater than this - I ain't doing wishy washy stuff - I've to get perfection for every endeavor I do.
SQ - Material world is for grats - no, for purification.
PIES - VA for social satisfaction - foundation for platform - utils for stable and healthy base.
    Sp/Tran/Truth for purpose of happiness - KC proposes love as highest prayojan in the Framework. // across scripures - avaroh but dictionary sizes different.
    aaroh also has frameworks - like multiverse, theory of relativity, etc.
PIES - Individual egos are dangerous until all of them believe in a society - VA.
    Eg - goons if believe in society then can give power as a service (PaaS).
    else it'll use power to exploit - but biz guy can hire goons to fight back.
    or lure max protection offering guy a little favor in return of protection from others - government is that.
Logs - Story - tried bounce in Bangalore. Also tried Yulu bikes - without risk we can't standardize something potentially useful.
Logs - Story - car insurance - parked car inside was taken out thru maneuvering and luckily guard had no problem else without sticker it could be.
    Learning the insurance intricacies when needed - call and have questions ready.
PIES - BJDK phases translate into DM, PM, Regex and Hello world to sprints.
LIB - Ashok is into Quality, Space management, Product procurement or SPC works.
EQ - why marry
    C - Social status, well being, boredom of no1 to share sth with, practically worldly probs (illness), no high maintenance
        avoid opposites - like miser spendthrift
    N - social awareness, mundane PS together (cooking, foods, luxuries), udna pudna (work things out like camera, installation, worldly problem solving)
    I - different emotions, different worldly experiences - explorations, adventure, sight seeing.
    PIES - HVAS or SVAF - All have bearing on others. So Varna - politics
        #1 company award. voice - great performers, etc. but secondary not primary considerations - important though.
        +1 be addressed in worldly considerations though also.
EQ - Marriage Portal
    Preferences - CC, edu, state, current resi (high maintenance), height, age (relatable), religion (relatable and has bearing)
        earning (social status), lang (no barrier), pets (high maintenance).
    Description+Photo+Families - hobbies in free time, pursuits, lifestyle - dressings, lang, alcohol. Cultured. Likeness.
    Chat; vid chat - subjective verification about truthfulness. truthful; experience grade on scale of 1 to 10.
    F2F - B2G, B'2G, B2G', B'2G', B''2G''.
        Face levels - excavate values, beliefs, case studies, nature, temperament, tolerance, fun loving, pursuits, ambitions.
    Describe adjectives for self and partner - values, some history, current State of the art of family.
SQ - it's always selfish. Point is where the selfishness is best served - be intel selfish.
    greatest selfish interest is in selfless love - but can't be explicit about it. pursuit is friendship - uanalysis is the undercurrent.
    it's obvious but it's formal and exciting.
PIES - 2 targets - 1 to be teacher - DMPM for all YT channels and other social media - anything helpful.
    2. Resume for all - enrichment.
    I've done PIES b4 but for grats streaming and not for social grats, now that is the focus.
    Config to master to transaction - config = standardize = health + DMPM + abstracts - foundation + DMPM + abstracts.
PIES - Foundation = HAS - Health, Abstract (PIES and indiv), scrum.
PIES - meta for goal setting
    About
        B4 making goals - let's study what should be goals.
        kernel - begin with the end result in mind - go and get it - ask and it is given, knock on the doors and they open. Layers + BJDK.
    Varna Goal and use cases
        spiritual seva, social seva - excellent interactions, worthy of designations. logs of grats and lapse while achievements, huge returns or money or rewards.
    Ashram goals
        spiritual general seva not specialized. Social interactions with family and world.
        sume of experiences.
        stories and logs. Best streaming like foreign fun.
    Spiritual goals
        Preach, help s.t ease of DS, sume of courses and achievements - wha tall is done.
        Stories, ecstasies and logs, best streaming - fun bhajans.
    Foundation
        health for seva (like vessel lifting), health for others.
        sume of health efforts, stories / challenges / logs, fun of it.
SQ - goal ain't NFP but brahmacarya. life of continence. Oj, Tej, JY, etc.
    What if's - lies I know; DY will take care of me.
    If trade-offs then I'd rather choose shreyas of yoga (or at least worth taking risk).
PIES - incentives for all classes of people
    Power
        Physical, desirable / abhor / like, science / orchestration / i/f management, reasonsing, position, numbers
        alliance / partners
        All layer serving the chess game of power - character / competence ; guna or karma.
    Wealth / resources - role with max wealth - achieve for wealth.
        love for wealth, partners for wealth, eth for wealth.
        demand supply middleman/ invest. Role to max that. delegate or oneself, make or buy, case stuies of wealth.
    Knowledge - BJDK and debates and discussions. Love for knowledge. Worship knowledge.
    Talent or skilled for grats - enjoy at or with 7, position => enjoyment.
        Like SG, etc it gets you. Allies for help, who can help.
        Getting work done is end goal for reward.
        Solution - study some highly skilled ppl and category-wise what all they did to get there.
        Love for skill.
SQ - Ishwar in 3 ways manifest
    sp energy - yoga maya energy - transformation.
    law of attraction.
    PD interference (not actions but situations)
PIES - Social layer like spiritual and ego layers comes with high rewards if done properly
    but likewise, also dangers, obstacles, difficulties, vulnerabilities like exploitations.
PIES - year goal
    for SQ - next master section should be Applications centered and bridge - no overlap cuz application is the focus and bridge is already done just revisit.
    for IQ - FL, Switch-ability, MBA (investments)
    for EQ - DMPM; Networking, GF.
    For PQ - Yoga, Running, NFP.
        Books - win friends, 7 habits, tony robbins, etc.
SQ - RSP saw potential - spoke iindirectly but I should also try to tap that potential in KC.
    we're like non-entities so find better reason for KC than personal narrative-giver.
    For SP like PD - yes full spiritual energy but not universal.
    I ain't internal potency - proof is anarthas.
    Even 6Gs - to call them manjaris ain't good attitude (KTP) - you ask me I'd say they were PMs in that kingdom who turned to DS.
SQ - Spiritual system is distributed not centralized. Power stays distributed not concentrated so no infatutation, pride and no domino effect fall down.
Logs - Story - Car parking inside society; 50% rent reduction in covid - inspiration from friends who did many months back.
    psychologists consultation tryst, bounce, etc.
    why car wobbled (syami once driving and bad driving from others; I cuz steering wheel changed angular position)
    Sticker for prestige so he paused - waiting is unfavorable so leave eftsoon.
    favorable situ - evening, back gate, story prep - forgot cleaning the car and prestige sticker. Air pump.
PIES - fearless, interactions, power, personal commitment, being a man not a boy - std others and eth and fearless - doer, orchestrator, provider.
PIES - Foundation - Personal (VA being social) - ABCD
    Attitude (all good qualities)
    Behavior - Skills, talents, health, amusement, practices, rituals.
    Communication - verbal - content for different rasas, figure of speech; Body language, tone.
    Devotion - scrum plan, exec, retro, etc.
    HAS - health (B), Abstract (AB), Scrum (D).
CS - Apple Mac - SSO cert but not F5 - always allow; admin rights thru software;
    32 bit android connection not allowed from phone - you know the name so download it. Developer mode - USB debugging, USB open.
    DMPM of Mac. Book - DOET from POET. Design of everyday thinking from process of every day thinking.

IQ - Youtube - Personal branding,
IQ - Debug Decision tree - thru discussions, figure out where the problem is thru checking what's working and what's not.
CS - can't find sca-maven-plugin or fortify one - java 8 - 1 of maven modules had problem - removed it to make maven sync well.

    Not leaving then bulb, chandelier, fuse removal. Sensitive wall - I touched it broke I am leaving.
    Locking rooms. charpayi taken to road in the night -  police complaint.
SQ - Krishna is not good or bad - nor are we supposed to stay till this realm - we gotta transcend to the realm beyond good and bad
    BG Krishna says he is both good and bad but being conditioned we want good or bad in terms of grats - we have to rise beyond.
    Why Krishna did sth to sages in past like Hiranya's time - cuz even they had to rise beyond good and bad in terms of experiences.
    Good experience give a great incentive and thus facilitate progress but so can bad experiences sometimes.
    That doesn't change his being supreme well wisher - cuz best self interest is not getting what we want conditionally but constitutionally.
CS - RnD Thinking - Layers 
    About - Human being is network of and pipelines of the following.
        The idea of distribution or networking (peers and servers) drills down to all the layers.
    [Digitized ]Data Interactions - Producers and Consumers - People, Browsers, Scraping programs, IOT Sensors and Actuators.
        @Senses - read, write, act.
        TOC, Regex, Compilers, NLP, DIP, etc.
    Data Source and Data Sink - Application and Data Servers.
        @Mind - store, recall.
        Standardization - G3 -> G4 languages - SQL doesn't find a way but exploits a standardized way - "what" to standardized "how".
        minor transformations. recall based mostly.
    Data Manipulation and churning - sync or async.
        @Intel - decision making algorithm to get to a desired goal.
        synchronous at runtime (small data), async batch, streaming.
        Standardization - G5 Languages (model -> (initial to end state))
            AI, ML, Give only the model of the problem and current state and end state - it will find the way etc.
            Many of DL applications tend to move to higher layers not this layer exactly (in terms of application and not means)
                Eg - image to details. Sentence to nouns and verbs. Audio to text and vv.
    Identity (max Soul Simulation) - give it layers and need to maximize profit cost functions - leave it free to act in a new modelled reality or system.
        Knowledge about a system and means about a system - Knowledge model given and left free to act - independent or distributed.
        PC lacks life injected into existence layers - like decision but not choice, store recall but not think or feel, etc.
        ML is done by professionals and is not an automated process. 
        When computer does the training process or performs reinforcement learning, that is different.
        Think of a robot given an urge for survival, greed for grats (simulated), social framework based maximized grats.
            Next, think how robot should figure out the the set of problems to further the markov's hierarchical needs.
            Also, given the set of problems, the robot should 
                figure out a set of candidate algorithms to target 
                select the best one
                an ability to adapt at runtime
                all this in collaboration with the changing and well networked environment.
        Now, most of the research focusses on PnC of everything - applied everywhere and standardized in biz interests.
            inter-discipline study for inspiration and mutual applications. Eg - ML was application of statistics to CS.
            Application of something to other domains. Eg - NLP or Image Recognition is application of ML to linguistics or photography.
            Exploration of possibilities - where we are as State of art is and what all is possible - juice it out fully.
CS - IDEA - There should teams chat topic for every backlog which 1 can join or leave anytime.

    prayojan status consists challenges and achievements.
    Abhidhyeya consists of done and what to do next.

CS - mvnrepository.com aggregates from many sources - not just maven central.
    there would be note below.
    Checkout all the repos that mvnrepository indexes from.
    maven dependencies in the windows were red marked cuz their dependencies could not be downloaded so included the repo of sap.
PIES - In Master phase of IQ, you gotta be a hackathon guy (innovation comes naturally) - quicker implementer of anything
    no responsibility to create a business but feature devp very fast.
    Regex knowledge so quick feasibility; POC available so quick implementations.
    Transaction phase will be ability to start business or support business - whichever is most rewarding.
    This track is ignoring FDDL mapping with discrete phases cuz former is continuous and should not dependent on latter.
    In Ashram, master is about ?(ability to do anything with resourcefulness) and later ?event plan, management or orchestrate.
    Once master phase starts, stories will start happening cuz it will be applications of eth PIES.
    Of course not at scale but individual short fun stories.
    In transaction those stories become novels or big deals worth talking about as stand alone topics.
    Foundational perspective, master will mark not just ABCD fundamentals but leveraging them actively every day with logs => Stories.

IQ - LIB - quick implementation of spark Pi implementation
    lesson learnt - we gotta go through the documentation without which we make silly mistakes. And turn around time of finishing off a simple use case takes huge time.
    So, abstract mastery has to come with documentation and book and same thing applies to master phase as well - every project has its wiki and git readme
        if not there or not clear enough - talk to colleagues every now and then and elicit moments of truths.
PIES - master phase is about speed - urgency - getting stuffs done in a unit time.
    this habit will come from trying speed in everything I do - speed in exercise, speed in bath, speed in sleep, speed in book reading, speed in code implementation, speed in interactions.
IQ - Alliance between 2 companies is like cross product - SAP X Microsoft OR SAP X Siemens.
CS - Personal Spark Notes - What is PiEstimation Program - PI*r^2 / r^2 - what proportion of random points generated in a square lie inside the circle.
    Think about it - what is the approach of talk in data frame
    this way spark wants its consumers to just talk in terms of current and final state of MR data I/O and it will figure out Map and reduce functions
        basically, standardization not requiring rigorous maths
    MR works as KV input coming as trivial key (rowNum JLT) and rows as values - you give transformations as you like.
        CSV connectors and others are nothing but standardized programs for converting initial KV of (rowNum,lines) into (rowNum, data tuple)
        Think of a simple table operation like filter or select
            how would that translate into MR operation of KV pairs.
            iterate over rows and extract the portion to determine qualification.
            If select also a part of it - then transform the tuple as per columns desired.
        How would group by and having translate - parse group by column and get hash and keep putting them in buckets (= shuffle) and reduce operation on theose buckets as per aggregation. Having is nothing but filter on those aggregations.
            so group by columns will be keys and aggregates waale columns will be values. Shuffle on them and reduce as per aggregations.
    Thus for all practical purposes, the data model and process model which spark wants us to think in terms of - is simplified. It's same old table, row, columns with different names and operations - df, ds, etc.
CS - Spark - Bad symbolic reference to spark in library class - cuz library not included - not required for my code but is required by the libraries.
    same thing applies to all spark connectors - My code doesn't need it but with your configurations, spark code will need it.
    error goes away.
CS - Spark - config signature doesn't match.
    not even required cuz we request spark submit endpoint to run the app - spark endpoint program will invoke our specific app mainclass using the override method is configured to invoke so no problems.
CS - Kibana Logs
    Discover - filter, select.
    Visualize - create visualizations over jobs.
    Dashboard - Organize your visualizations.
    Management
IQ - We can ask questions from other colleagues (esp senior ones), like stack overflow questions.
    your base knowledge, your expectations and results. what debugging you tried and your findings.
    That way another colleagues should be able to solve a problem in less than 5 minutes.
    And don't hesitate to ask anyone for this 5 minutes help.
    And also be willing to offer this 5 mins help to anybody.
    In fact, always prefer 1 minute help over 5 mins help - that saves eb's time - so sth like ping a question for help can make a difference.
CS - IDEA - conceive of ideal logging.
    with all different log levels - think of ability to collapse the logs into hierarchical buckets.
    assuming that hierarchy is respected and logging is ideal - it should take less than 1 minute to solve it.
CS - Spark cluster thru CF comes with
    credentials
    service url - REST endpoints.
    UI Proxy - spark management.
    logs - kibana logs and dashboards.
    history proxy - past jobs.
IQ - You gotta know how to pin point the source.
    Eg - rather than searching with guessed names where spark job must be getting created - better call the spark swagger api classes - it is bound to work.
PIES - Master is like application phase - history study is config.
    historical applications in current times is master.
IQ
    My documentation following was perfect in every case - only scope of improvement was 
        sometimes documentation isn't sufficient - it gives only 1 line of usage and skips another - the other line of usage like batch job, I would do lots of steps delineated for regular line of usage so any reference is a great help.
        Other times, it suggests and problem is with our expectation like cf ssh program should end - no it's like chisel tunner it will stay on until stopped.
    When a senior asks for async job for you - you accept it and you should accept it - we should value their time and eventually we also need to behave like that - async help to others.
        OR help by hints, help by documentation, help by delegation, help by right person reference

PIES - Applications of economics in Foundations
    there is only so much you can achieve on Production Possibilities frontier (PPF) without sharpening the saw and foundational changes.
    so work hard but more importantly learn to work smart and improve the work itself.
    We start from a place where we have measured TME stock which we can exchange or trade in order to achieve overall wellness on the PPF.
    But we should grow the multi-dimensional karmic curve thru practice, techniques, action in stretch zone and foundational improvemtns (stability MOG, etc)
        also innovation, application of other fields and applications into our own.
    Too little of PIES will cause suffering and also too much of PIES will come at a price of others - so trading TME wisely on PPF - get to the point of interest.
        but also stretch it so that the radial distance from the origin increasees - preferably in all the dimensions.
IQ - LIB - if we make stages of our developments then we are a black box - not only we achieve tasks but we make them CICD available for other team members as well.
    so that if for some reason, we change the task, we still had made the contribution to a checkpoint and others can pick from there.
    These stages of development look on jira with task completed but also a deliverable - like wiki page added, git branch created, PR or merged, quality checked, etc.
    Try to have some deliverable coming every mid week (every 2 days) along with some presentation (can be in minutes, even seconds but really important)
    Every day is like a hackathon and we should reflect in state of wow on reflecting on the day after its done.
    All meetings arranged and discussions over sub-tasks level (or different grains as per needs) - topic of the meetings and efforts logged there.
    Master study for a user story also comes under the effort but not curiosity based master exploration
        cuz you can't take scrum responsibility for the latter in work day efforts.
IQ - Our work day is constituted of working on sub-tasks across user stories (OR High level work life)- nothing else.
    It is in sub-tasks execution at a time that we face different challenges at the abstract or master level.
    These challenges should also be noted as the part of user story execution - which will eventually become a tool for analytics.
    At the start of the day or effort - think end result once, and then a set of sub-tasks (across user stories) - a set because we need to preempt for best results.
    it is true that during the execution we may encounter sub-tasks getting spawned but that's ok - just update it in the jira.
IQ - VS Code is powerful. Shift + click on the arrow for tabs level indentation segregations in even text file. So automatic hierarchies everywhere.
PIES - Get Agitated or not - Grat streaming now vs later
    How can I not get agitated in worldly situations while being here, I should be agitated and take apt steps
    The answer is in abstraction of life at different grains
    Hour gets lost - only its essence or abstract remains.
    Similarly, Day, week, month, year all pass away with only its essence or abstract remaining which we can also call as karmic reactions.
        This can be thought of as fragrance which wind carries after its all gone.
    So, from karmic perspective, we gotta know where (state) we wanna land into - cuz eth else will just pass through us.
        even that state will also pass thru (cuz temporary world) but that state characterizes higher grat streaming.
        This also means that in pursuit of the state, you should not lose current set of state you transition thru
            cuz what if that final state ain't that rosy.
            OR what if that grat streaming comes packaged with some maintenance or even pain streams.
            what about current state if always you are see green grass on other side then even after reaching there you will find grass still farther.
            So, ideal way of living is grat streaming through the state (without infatuation in pursuit of something still higher)
    This line of thinking explains that while we want to enjoy in the current state - this is still a transitory phase to be traversed through.
        We would like to navigate thru these states with as little bothers as possible
        but even the set of bothers along the way, is a great help for final state which we had not even conceived of yet.
        So, while doing justice to all current situations is important for grat streaming, our ideals don't lie in current shit but in evolved states of being.
    So practically speaking, whether work for the present or prepare for the future - both are just 2 different tasks in a backlog which are meant to be processed by OS thru preemption.
        and there is a need to reflect and retrospect and introspect so that we stay calm, understanding the larger scheme of things desirable.
        @just like, daily scrum is important but doing justice to them isn't enough - sprint end retrospection still matters or rather matters far more and so forth.
        So, keep eyes on sprint goals is far important but at expense of daily scrum, would be a clear of sign of shortcoming or falling short.
        Also, an important exercise to find our state expectations (vision and goals) at different grains - life, decade, 2 years, semester, month, etc.
        And this line of thinking comes under transaction phase of server - it's not config or master - actually it's meta of transactions so can call it config.
        This adds another dimension to our PIES - it is FDDL incentive but also for present or future or past - 3 cardinality of this set.
EQ - LIB - In company what if a third party misbehaves
    clarify it with them - most of the times there is a communication gap.
    If not, Raise it with HR (escalation).
    If not, Raise it with ur manager (who represents SAP for you)
    If not, raise it with ur MD thru some channels (who represents SAP for policy making level).
    If not, approach courts or police or media (as apt) - whoever you think is guilty.
    If not, let go (many of the previous steps can also be bypassed in interest of present well being - some times wasting time isn't worth money).
PIES - present framework of thinking - if your allies don't give justice to your present, break the bond - whether IQ or EQ or whatever.
    but we can't decide it on smaller grains cuz life is meant to have those flavors as well for well being.
    Lifetime commitment - conditionally (if eth goes fine) or unconditionally (irrespective) these are other combinations
        think these in cartesian product with IQ and EQ, etc.
        So, if boss ain't proper will you still stay with him for lifetime?
        Or if husband is crazy and drunkard, do you still stay with him for lifetime?
IQ - Installed MS Teams on mobile device with Microsoft Auth. OR even register mobile call or sms.
CS - Maven
    scalac: error: scala.reflect.internal.MissingRequirementError: object java.lang.Object in compiler mirror not found.
        java version compatibility.
    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession
        The problem was the pom dependency was scoped provided and not compile and hence was not being supplied during this phase.
CS - Maven - Failed to execute goal net.alchim31.maven:scala-maven-plugin:3.2.0:compile (default) on project
    Check 2 tabs up - there are compilation errors in the code.
IQ - Not only top down is the way to teach but top down is the way to work and showcase.
    So you should not do POC on n items and after everything is done, you culminate everything into useful - only to find some other POCs still required.
    Best way to work is you deliver AMAP - maybe a UI with all the connections showing the message - it is under repair.
    So forth. Simulate things in objects until a DB is available. So forth.
    So, in BJDK we are talking about K or transactions in IQ life - this should follow top down approach.
    This is not to disregard sequence - of course, design first then implementation; but not bottom up, rather top down.
    Even in design don't try figuring low level details b4 presenting the page - just scribble high level information for HLD then LLD.
PIES - why we gotta work under concern mode or fear or tension mode.
    actually no matter who or where you are that's how things are supposed to be.
    Our choice or expertize is in making best choice for a set of tensions. Changing from 1 tension to another tension of our choice.
        Eg - In all pies, child birth, marriage, DevOps to DS or teacher or vv, etc.
    when we act and fantasize about ideal life and act towards it - we just choose a new package of concerns under new circumstances.
    This is not pessimism but a reality - golden chains or iron chains are all chains.
    Unalloyed streams of grats is possible in heaven. Here, you find kheer - either limited or adulterated or bodily limited.
PIES - Transaction phase characterized by making allies like people do for songs, movies, x-men, marvel avengers
    the best emerges when we have cooperating lions. And event management on top of that is transactional phase.
    Mastery over your craft and hence cooperating lions is something you exhibit across these phases, especially in transactional.
    But managing this cooperation is also yet another role - but high level delegation and overseeing juniors yes, cuz you are truly the master in transactional phase.
    Master phase is also about ability to show all the talents you have - like in singing - all kinds of singing within a song - hip hop, stretch, pop, etc tapestry.
        Or like avengers movie - you know what your audience wants so create a story to get to the points of their interest in interesting ways.
        And precise rewards that you know they want.
SQ - Women so many people behind so a situation not favorable for spirituality. Facilities for worldly fun and culture of enjoyment.
Logs - Story - COVID so huge demand - SAP ally medibuddy funds must have fallen short and so ate up wfh allowance by merging it with next year.
CS - We don't write version for Spring starter in pom cuz version must already be coming from the parent pom (spring parent)
IQ - Daily scrum targets other colleagues but to have same frame of reference - like in parliament we talk to speaker, scrum master who also represents the team. Speaker in parliament is a kafka topic.
IQ - There can be lots of master learning from the DoD role. Take eg of already solved to have further learnings - of course some basic code knowledge should be there.
    But master exploration in emergency like very high - not desirable. Master learning from Daily scrum. Master learning from DoD. Master learning from exploration.
    All of these things also give abstract or config learning.
    In daytime (or better, scrum responsibility time), only master learning contextual to a sub-task is allowed and you take scrum responsibility for it
        explorations can happen anytime outside of scrum responsibility time.
IQ - At start of the day or even start of a user story (or backlog), we should serialize the DAG of efforts in an appealing way.
    Topological sort - but act top down not bottom up.
    All of these activities at different granularities - slot work to work day to user story to backlog
        always start with SMART end result in mind and emotions feeding the determination.
    For eg - Review phase subtask, Design Wiki page subtask, git repo creation, HLD implementation, basic delivery with stubs,
        Successful scenario controllers and model - UI controller, application controller, utilities controller
        View Beautification phase - UI beautification, application all exceptional scenarios FOE, utilities misbehaviors to be accounted for.
    This approach is both scalable, evolutionary, CICD compliant, and giving you sense of achievement while WYSIWYG approach.
PIES - IQ is a problem to solve. EQ is a different problem to solve etc - similarly for PIES.
    IQ is standardized service. EQ is standardized love. These are different problems to solve.
    Standard service streams - we can serialize top down and all these mantras + 1 more thing is interactions to have more or less complete picture.
    We make interactions while making business problems, functional specifications; there interactions while finalizing design;
    Implementation discussions - blockers, cross team services and clarifications; code review for design checks.
    Functional review for functional checks. V-shaped all discussions exist - these showcase power (or responsibility) and is a contribution which elicits applauds and rewards.
    EQ notices how much services are being done but more importantly how they are utils for love (to whatever degree).
    SQ - can't expect worldly love from spirituality else we will be discouraged. But it is transcendental and takes game to next level.
CS - Maven - use dependency:analyse to find dependency related updates required in the pom file.
PIES
    Psychology of mirroring for survival helps make different cultures along with all its variegated-ness and attractiveness.
    Already existing tendencies from subtle body - a person expresses himself and similar subtle bodies like it.
    Encouragement to do that more and also starts a mirroring effect - we like to be the ones we idolize and general tendency to be the ones around us.
    Thus, a person tends to adopt lots of mannerisms of people around him - thereby making clusters at level of city, state, country
        cuz of degree of association and idolizing which is natural being similar subtle bodies.
        that's why neighboring clusters have similar properties or resembling properties.
    It's not even about differences in subtle body or degree of similarity but compatibility of subtle body for ashram be it a friend or whatever.
PIES - ability to control emotions spontaneity - just like ability to control your laughter when 7 gets hurt.
    REL in JSR I laughed but handled by leaving the room.
Logs - Story - I took part in stage presentation cuz my VOICE colleague wanted a partner
    My psychological reasons why dictatorship ain't good which I made at runtime inspired by SQ training - 4 defects.
    Showed appreciative expressions on the my teacher who was the judge. I stayed happy with that much reciprocation.
Logs - Story - Why that lapse - she chose to leave and I complied cuz soul is free. Offensive behavior especially for related love objects is far more serious.
    of course, that it's a bad bet (at all the layers) - this is noteworthy point b4 proceeds but anyways.
EQ - Flight - what's not allowed
    Radioactive Materials
    Explosives
    Weapons
    Corrosive Substances
    Peroxides & Oxidisers
    Misc. Dangerous Goods
    Flammable Liquids
    Flammable Solids
    All Gases

EQ - Ability to tolerate anarthas of people within bounds
	if it comes to your concern then settle the matter then and there. Of course, it is cheap on your part meaning that your spending behavior still is not at the point where you would consider that much amount to be insignificant and not worth thinking about.
	And of course, it is cheap on other side as well but this is pretty much expected from the worldly existence. Becoming overtly disturbed or excited by such worldly exchanges is itself a proof of less spiritual advancement.
	Not that a spiritually advanced person would be apathetic towards it but he would perform dharma while tolerating rather accepting people for the state that they are in. He won't be disturbed by it just concerned and address the issue thru head-on pragmatism. If the issue can't be handled, he would rather accept the situation as it is. Like BSST would say KC can't wait for britishers to leave the country. There would be someone in material world whose subtle body wants power (coming from descent of any ego or identity) - which is a legitimate expectation from VA - it is people with anarthas willing to conform to Krishna's model of mutual cooperation and not pure devotees trying to have interactions within material world.
	First thing is to empathize with Shringi and second is to understand how terribly wrong he was in terms of disproportionate punishment and immaturity in seeing small picture and not its repercussions.
	There has been intolerance debate on tv - which is an excellent word to bring up - people do and should tolerate within limits - some place the anarthas are the norm and rules need to be made to accomodate such behaviors within the laws. Some places will permit anarthas under the table. Beyond limits some action needs to be taken otherwise the tolerance is seen as weakness and cowardice which leads to a realm that you don't belieave in.
	Like movie seven, even extreme anger towards someone's anarthas is also an anartha. Anartha of anger.
PIES - SQ - Realm changes with spiritual advancement.
	We may think that it is ego that determines realm - to a good degree it does. but not entirely. Abstract out further from ego interactions within a society and you realize that the society could have had different models called social ideologies. Those social ideologies accept or reject the worldly "tools" of different crafts or egos depends on the their beliefs, social customs, social values, etc. Eg - India accepted IT but with lots of discussion on the impacts it will have in the economy. Realm is not just made the interaction of those egos that make up the economics but also human psychology of that place.
	A person of similar subtle body is born in that place and pivots to an ego as per the upbringing and person attraction. But the person feels very happy in the ambience and environment of that place. Identifies a lot with people. Believe in the ideological end goals, ideological means, etc. The thing to them is superior to themselves. It stands above them. This explains why people agree to die for their nation or for their profession in taj. Some rebels fight against the state - to them they are fighting on this layer which is above their personal ego.
	That's why people persuaded with spiritual reasonings are dangerous and so terribly wrong. It addresses a need of belonging to a realm of choice.
	Different places are differently suited as per the state of anarthas or weeds you have. Surprisingly people with anarthas in some places are very highly situated - it is a disadvantage spiritually so first it's not that good. Why opulence? We should not be jealous of anybody behind the surface. Whoever has opulence has got them by the grace of god - on what basis? they have paid the price. The price of tapasya or penance, the price of giving time, money, efforts. The price of donations, etc. These are spiritual dimensions expressed in the material realm. They may even be into spirituality but at their deepest core they have taken birth in a realm cuz they belong there - from subtle body perspective. After death the realm is chosen on the basis of subtle body - family and society is given as per what would be most apt.
PIES - SQ - I don't think very high of people - well, duh! in general but more evolved state is like 6 goswamis of bowing down to even neophyte devotees.
	what does this mean? It means that they are fully dedicated to the transcendence and whatever spark of transcendental rightness they find they bow down unto that and the holder is respectable for representing that to whatever degree.
	Less anarthas are good for business - eg a person arranged for another plate free of cost cuz we were not satisfied with the service. Don't you think if we were frequent visitors, we will like to visit them again. Whereas those who are cut to cut and would rather take rounding off as ceiling instead of floor or nearest digit of even mild amount, we will be less disposed towards it. Many may ignore accepting anarthas as they are but you know what is more respectable and gratifying experience.
EQ - Economics - Centralized market vs distributed market - centralized where champs rock the show. With communism things just replace champs with govt being the champ.
	VA working model knows too well that there are pros and cons on both sides but VA believes in distributed model of economy. Not centralization of power.
	Think globally but act locally is their motto. I heard some people say that centralization of say singing helped them get better at increase in demand in the distributed model. So probably what we need is the distributed model of economy coupled up with centralization co-existing.
	We don't want a selected few holding all the money in the world - that just makes crime increase and increase in social dissatisfaction. So income taxes are a great help but those belong to govt - so they can make a thumbs up deal among each other.
	IT like other tools made the jobs increase in market as expected but graph of economy it creates doesn't grow exponentially.
	Think past decades even rich people would eat chapattis with pickle cuz of bad economy so centralization is necessary.
PIES - Manasvi - fully active but not conscious of surroundings - like in a sleep b4 wake up
    scientists are manasvi st forget surroundings.
    Yogis are manasvai. Tapasvi - is absorption in tapa. Taking self on mind or tapa - incentive-ize your meditation.
PIES - Give direction to your efforts
    We end up with lots of busy-ness - it is important that we always know our culminating point else we tend to go haywire.
        ultimately eth ends what remains is the abstract - we are not meant to play with cheap thrills but see a larger picture.
        The follow lists different granularities goals but they are not mutex and the former is meant to act as the lighthouse for the latter.
        It is like you are on a journey but choose the trace which is more satisfying. Some people may choose the shortest trace in favor of enjoyable ride - that's a personal choice.
    And may feel a sense of incompleteness even after doing a lot. The hierarchy of goals is as follows:
        Godhead - truly worthy goal after life - we have to achieve the stage of love by EOL - so need urgency. Eg - SP line.
            At least, qualify for the righteous circle
            At least, qualify to be a demigod
            SVAF - Spiritual visions, VAF - subtle body readiness for next lives.
        Legacy - Giving legacy (BJDK - showed way, knowledge, PS, made something) to future generations - everything else abstracts out to nothing - but legacy lives on.
            Eg - ISKCON, Yoga by Ramdev, many historical personalities like freedom fighters, etc.
            SVAF - legacy in spirituality, legacy in varna (research papers), legacy in ashram (3 idiots movie), in foundation (some abstract health topics)
        YOLO - Living a fulfilling life - all layers of gratifications - YOLO conscious life.
            S - Social Spirituality
                Love for Jivas.
                service as a goal - contributions in the present.
            V - Ego - Becoming - by paying the price. Heisenberg.
                Intel - work where lots of challenges are solved - all the while. Walter White's Umph!
            A - Mind - fun where social consumption is significant - all the while. Swat Cats Yeah! Ye zindagi milegi na dubara.
            F - best and authentic personal self - where I get to learn and be what I want while I am here. Newton, batman, spider-man.

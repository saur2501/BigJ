PersonalErp - Driving 
	Trying to overtake and blocking others especially those coming from opposite side. Solution - first look and confirm that they are far from the clear way and they with horn overtake and take your regular position - the gap should be significant and should not be a challenge.
	When cow comes in front, give horn or wait or manuever with confidence but not in a rush - the pressure of crowd - no pressure, see, it's a legitimate problem we have to overcome.
	IntelliJ dependency analyzer can do the job of dependency tree. External libraries don't show up if some error - go to project structure and libraries - check the error
		invalid classes root - this solved thru invalidate cache and restart. OR maven reimport. Or remove and add the dependency.
	Build on master failing - it is less probable because it is same as Commit and we make sure jenkins pipeline runs fine before PR merge is triggered. So, Jenkins foundations02 pipeline trigger and compare to that - it works - now take a fresh pull on your system same as master and try on that - no change at all. Add your changes on top of that.
Social - Clubs for everything I do - Hearing, Preaching and association; Company Project; Home and Friends Group; Foundational clubs online.
	find a company for everything you wanna do and keep updating your resume thru those sessions.
	This is not a replacement for personal SVAF but a complementary extensions which skyrocket your grats.

	There are always leaders or architects above engineers. The hierarchy always exists - meaning your ability to service at the best that your junior is inspired to serve under.

PIES - Personalize vs Process - always contact a person rather than asking process to work as expected.
PIES - I want streak in everything I do. This is very rewarding way of doing things rather than routine - routine is important for bhakti so many days you just do justice with bare minimum but every once in a while is a time for streak.
PIES - How to measure your growth - some metrics - old files - I had got many better and structured ideas later.
	Challenge yourself - Put yourself into a situation where you must demonstrate your advancement.

					Illusion (lamentation for enjoyment)
PIES - Measure Ashram in - Shopping (SRM), cooking (foodie life, SCM Prod), entertainment (HCM), Decor or resourcefulness (SCM Logisitcs), Networking (CRM), Security (Foundation).
PIES - NFP - Excitement vs Happiness - Stay high paying proper price vs short high trip with a hack.
	former comes with facing difficulties. The latter comes with escaping difficulting and hacking into high.
	SVAF is never meant to be easy - the easiest thing to be is stay an animal but even that is full of difficulties - survival of fittest.
	difficulties tap you to endorphins and that's also awesome but with goddamn price for happiness.
	If angry with Krishna, take shelter of social high (even that's not easy) - to get excitement is easiest but such fake trips don't take you anywhere.
	Not that I can but I do face difficulties every single goddamn time.
	Socializing pleasure isn't easy but if you lose yourself unto that without your personal ego channel still you will feel busted - so the exponential curve of healthy life is always important.
	Problems st show up in material transactions like "what the heck you did" - but the real problem exists in config "this vulnerability always existed, just that bad situ didn't show up". So, work on your anarthas cuz transactions can bring something undesirable, they may not but why keep a stool like problem with you.
	What if I don't want difficulties - then you should either settle with lower happiness which is against your constitutional position and so or otherwise, you will be forced to hack into cheap highs and stay on the lower strata - we do see the highs of different chakras but get to a higher layer, demands a goddamn price.
PIES - first of all lapse should never happen and if it happens, it should never repeat 
	so, the idea is enter into things with proper intelligence or planning and if at all there is a lapse, you gotta learn from it immediately not experientially but conceptually so that it never repeats.
PIES - I fear somebody will think I don't know something - lapse of jnana is better than lapse of bhakti - that's the first rule. 
	lapse of dhyan is better lapse of jnana. lapse of karma is better than lapse of dhyan - you struggled to achieve something but you what all you did. You tried that is ok but you don't know that this is not how it works! You don't know how it works is ok, but you don't even want is bothersome.
	scrum updates in all SVAF abstract and concrete - every day. Updates outta NIC+E - fear driven is still good but struggle is better word, desire driven for something interesting you did in an update, duty driven of what was supposed to be done. Love of how it was fun.
	Scrum circles - Varna C office, Varna A colleagues, Ashram A relevant friend circle, Concrete A family and friends, Spiritual Concrete - some temple connected to, Spirituality abstract - some sajatiya dev or counselor system, Foundational C - relevant groups like NFP, December Run, etc; Foundational A - family and friends (how is health) - as observed there's huge overlap between ashram and foundation so merging their scrum.
	SVAF growth is meant to be tough, if it was cake walk, eb could do it - it's not just personality (behavior) but also character (attitude) struggle or challenge. Without the price you don't get anything. So, forget hacks, anybody has become anything in life is actually worth respecting cuz it is paying a heavy price in cultivating behavior and attitude thru BJDK with persistence or tapasya.
PIES - SocialErp is Varna realm's projection in Ashram and PersonalErp is Foundation's projection in Ashram - Ashram is primarily about HomeErp and Networks.
PIES - Power lies with jiva, prakriti (ext and int); ishwar (narrative and law of attraction, karma justice - stateful).
	I gotta grow from vyakti to smashti. Social phase - serve but not exploited - evolution to happiness (sp realm as a side note)
	follow ur bliss - but challenges from jivs, prakriti, etc - goal is not to "not do sth" but "have passion to do something"
	9 stages of bhakti - all about growing happiness - lust like temperature (so needful) - stages all abt inc relp - nishtha - firm jaan lena not just maan lena.
		solid graduation like marriage - Taste cultivation like trip planning in ruci hase.
		Asakti - Oneness state - can't see separate; feel bad on hurt. Bhaav - emotions in love. Love (it's about you not even us (asakti))
		Social is excellent but risky cuz anarthas in ppl and not the best bet but an excellent platform. Scrum, helping, seeking, discussing, updating are imp to me in current phase.
	Personal Enoyment or me time like 1hr / week.
	Lapse that I should have been sleeping at that time.
	You become like your association.
PIES - Joke vs serious - conformity vs spontaneity - liberitans vs conservatives - gotta balance.
PIES
	corruption of all varnas. Ashrams corruption. 
	ola cabs without scaling is few 1000s of benefit ain't nothing
	Business Man - caught up with supply and demand taking advantage of.
	culture or civilization of hacks - including online courses and songs and so forth but don't deny those. Speak nothing of hacks extrema.
SocialErp - Psychologist vs clinical psychologist vs Psychiatrist - 
	general psychologists focus on healthier people, while clinical psychologists focus on people with more serious mental health issues. Regardless of where they work, clinical psychologists help patients with behavioral and mental health issues.
	Psychiatrists are medical doctors, psychologists are not. Psychiatrists prescribe medication, psychologists can't. Psychiatrists diagnose illness, manage treatment and provide a range of therapies for complex and serious mental illness. Psychologists focus on providing psychotherapy (talk therapy) to help patients.
SocialErp - Plumber - for fluid movement - Taps, toilet, etc - Toilet flush needs lubrication from below not above.
	The part of push flush needs replacement, kachra in the tap orifice. Balcony water stuck.
SocialErp - Whatsapp for business - Thyrocare. Same queue and you get a person assigned and talks; after resolved - session closes on their side.
SocialErp - Kochi Bar also, dinner, Breakfast both the days.
	Kind talks with 3-wheeler - just a little empathy - kismat hi sabkuch hai - I agreed and he felt great. gf besides family. shook our hands.
SocialErp - Pyschologist Consultation
	Suggestions
		Be Honest
		Have an Open Mind
		Don't Be Shy
	Problem
		Personal Bad Experience - Expectation vs reality.
			You don't take interest in me - but she never used to talk.
			We don't have anything between us - have I ever shown interest in you. Didn't even consummate the marriage - I want to know you first.
			She brought the motion of divorce and was keen on that - I resisted cuz of my conditioning but had to comply seeing the onslaughts from family.
		Personal Impact - At that time, deeply hurt me - Even if car topples, that would be better than the life that I have got into.
			I don't care what the world thinks - the life sucks already.
			I don't deserve this and crying seeing a mirror - no matter others, I will continue to love you.
		Fear of problem being real - although I have enough evidence and verbal mentions of she being uninterested and being forced into marriage. 
			stating that I was socially not enough - I said I am decent but they said that ain't enough - you had to be driving cars already.
			The guilt of whether I fell short and if it was true to any degree that I did an injustice - this used to eat me up.
		I can't even tell to my relatives so living a duplicitous life. It was like a standing car was hit by another vehicle.
			what should I do.
		My family didn't deserve this.
			I ain't never going back to that family.
			The turmoil that they caused to my family is the worst.
		I never drank thinking of it as an addiction - I really desired I should do that.
	Concerned about long term impacts on my psychology - possibility that I was not good enough for a relationship. Or that whether I did anything wrong to her.
		Skeptical with every girl I meet. Hopes of finding a good partners is pretty shattered.
			I fear injustice to the other girl - loss of self worth or self esteem - I can't do anything wrong to another person.
		All the psychological changes I might be subconsciously going thru that can prove to be disadvantageous.
		Face or hide dielemma - Not officially married but rituals were done. So, next person if I tell they may imagine so many things about me.

EQ - Unconditional acceptance - See, we gotta accept others for what they are - even if bags of shit we gotta accept them and plan accordingly. Eg - married and person is bag of liability still gotta accept them - same thing applies in other relations as well. 1 thing is don't expect too much and transcend whatever little troubles we find in the way - cuz there is so much to do than to bother. Let's not miss on opportunities.

CS - Kafka
	Apps interact
		Producers - Publishes records to the topics in kafka.
		Consumers - pulls records stored in kafka topics.
	Streams - client library for processing data stored in kafka. Stream processors interact.
	Connectors - a framework to build connectors for in / out movement of data between kafka and other systems. Like DB.
	Intro
		Documentation - Distributed streaming platform. similar to message queue or enterprise messaging system.
		Message system - producers message broker and consumers.
			see the mess with n and m target and source systems. @wire mess.
			vs adapter.
			fault tolerant.
			Store in kafka message logs.
		Stream - continuous stream of messages can be handled. Stream processing apps - read and store back or pass on.
CS - Linux directory structures
	/
	IaaS
		/dev - virtual files for the devices.
		/media - removable drives as folder.
		/mount - system admins use this to manually mount a filesystem.
	OS (=windows)
		/boot - boot files
			contains the files of the kernel and boot image, in addition to LILO and Grub
		/proc - process and kernel files
			information about. to get runtime system information.
		/var - variable data files - appData
			programs store runtime information like system logging, user tracking, caches, and other files that system programs create and manage.
			Eg - login history - not cleaned automatically. All logs also in here - mail server logs, system boot logs, kernel logs, etc.
		/etc - configuration file (of system) used by admins or services (password file and networking files)
			system config changes like hostname change is done here.
	Shell - OS Facade (=windows system32 files)
		/bin - binaries
			executable files of many basic shell commands like ls, cp, etc.
		/sbin - only su can run these binaries.
		/lib - shared libs.
			codes that can be used by the executable binaries
	PaaS - softwares for dev or prod (= program files)
		/usr - user program data and binaries.
			all the executable files, libraries
			/usr/bin - basic user commands. sbin for additional user commands. lib - system libs.
			Eg - /usr/bin/python.
			Observation - by default all apt-get installations go here and other parts like etc and all.
		/opt - optional software
			installing/storing the files of third-party applications that are not available from the distribution’s repository
			eg - /opt/tomcat, /opt/eclipse-installer
	SaaS and personal data also (=D Drive)
		/root - for super user.
		/home - for all users - has bin, sbin, lib eth.
	Software Data (appData is actually /var)
		/srv - service data like website data.
		/tmp - temp files
			deleted when your system restarts. Apps use for temp storage.
	Eg - apt-get maven install writes to /usr/bin/mvn and also etc and /usr/share.
		Just like program files contains application executables but data and configuration like registry details is somewhere else.

CS - Sometimes browser is configured with proxy.pac file to act as proxy server from the machine.
	when many proxy servers exist and based on the hostname used in browser the proxy server should be decided.
	A sample statement in such file looks like follows - if ( shExpMatch(host, "office365.com") ) { return "PROXY 194.138.0.25:9400;PROXY 194.138.0.26:9400"; }
CS - Why use maven modules - 
	Monoliths with tiers vs
	Microservices - separate apps with needed talking with each other. Parition your big app. Even UI becomes a microservice.
		vs DAG of dependendencies from devp space - not outside like MVN - different modules - eg - x4, BAF, Foundation used by all the functional modules simultaneously - if this was the case of parallel functional devp then foundation could be a separate dependency to be used thru maven but we want simultaneous devp so using it.
			Think of this as single dependency of your project which doesn't need to be a separate project until there are many consumers for that jar.
			let's call maven modules as project dependencies only but restricted to the scope of the project.
		vs package - package is within a single focussed app - unique purpose served thru a set of packages.

CS - CentOS launch another shell thru another tab OR use background jobs.
CS - Set maven's JAVA_HOME to anything higher than the release you wanna use and it will happily do it but not vv.
	Scala plugin is both mvn and IDE requirement - former to compile and latter to make it run
	set JAVA_HOME for the session in which you want to use a certain alternative.
CS - Using logger in spark app - spark/conf spark-default.conf file write the following line
	spark.driver.extraJavaOptions	   -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -Dspark.yarn.app.container.log.dir=app-logs -Dlogfile.name=hello-spark
	spark app only needs hadoop windutils in its path - not SPARK_HOME but the path for latter can help in other places but not in standalone  problem.
	spark per hadoop version number, pyspark version and spark version should match (similarly scala version and spark against scala version should match. download package - pyspark for IDE - similarly scala for Intellij.
	SparkSession is the driver not your main program. Note cmd line shell.
	Anaconda - python distribution, Spyder and Jupyter all come with it. Pycharm is favorable IDE.
	Just bookmarks - IDEs also have config saved in a file and later export it for new machine or installation.
CS - Spark run - only hadoop home, run spark code on a lang (platform, IDE, run config, env variables)
	pycharm = IntelliJ but project setting from interpreter settings on status bar.
	Notebook = spyder but also remember the state in former and code look in the latter.
	installing pyspark in python sdk = installing spark dependency using mvn or sbt in scala envt. compatible version thru prefix or suffix.
IQGrats - Suggested the idea of natural language processing on BCT tickets based on history.
	History we have - which team finally solved the ticket so use that to train a classification model based on NLP.
IQGrats - JAVA_HOME is required for MAVEN else any amount of configuration simply busts it - solution set JAVA_HOME variable for the session of maven run and then get rid of it.
	The same idea can be extended to other tools as well.

	reverse KT mode - where they come back of questions. This KT by new colleagues - not active members of meeting. Now question is how do I test it while debugging, etc.
	That I am ok with KT is one time effort but setting up system needs availability from devps.
	enabling them is the means - this investment is lacking from our side.
	2 meetings - reverse KT and trouble shooting.
	Action item - you book the reverse KT.
	API made to do primitive checks to help them forward the ticket to right time.
FND - Scrum - PC be my workspace and cloud for persistence.

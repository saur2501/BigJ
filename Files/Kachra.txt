HomeErp - Bike - Battery Dead Problem
	Use kick-start (if that option is available in bike)
	Otherwise, visit the nearest available service station/mechanic/battery repair shop to charge the battery.
	Call on-road helpline of the bike manufacturer (if available)
	Try to Push-N-Start the bike (like they used to start mopeds in olden days). This option may not work with many of the bikes. Not with heavy ones at least.

LIB - Scrum - How can we minimize the work - am I audible; Any ideas - pinpoint a person.
	you came prepared with probs then also ideas for improvements.
	Meeting-less day.
Scrum - Calendar blockings - when stuck then inputs from others - How would approachability work and transfers.
	some handholding for new colleagues - tailoring mode - dedicated 1 hr with buddies and 1 hr of development.
	reverse KT mode - where they come back of questions. This KT by new colleagues - not active members of meeting. Now question is how do I test it while debugging, etc.
	That I am ok with KT is one time effort but setting up system needs availability from devps.
	enabling them is the means - this investment is lacking from our side.
	2 meetings - reverse KT and trouble shooting.
	Action item - you book the reverse KT.
	API made to do primitive checks to help them forward the ticket to right time.
IQGrats - Suggested the idea of natural language processing on BCT tickets based on history.
	History we have - which team finally solved the ticket so use that to train a classification model based on NLP.
LIB - Scrum - We want war but don't have equipments with us - at least have backlog outside of release backlog.
	On any rainy day we try that, are we equipped.
	Looking for development work - this is a specific problem to be looked into.
	Task readiness - checklist b4 a task is picked.
	!DAG of tasks
	Let's add another stage to our jira board - release ready.
	If current functionality doesn't exist we will ask developers to make it. Don't restrict desires based on availability - standardize and plan accordingly but don't shy from take tools to ideal place.
	make claims it has deadline - this is money guys.
	Next time gimme lesser talk time - have no unmute button for meeting - I would rather have no mute button.
	Action items of last retro and what's the status with that.
	analysis - 60 reflections, 36 topics, 14 present.
EQ - Withings healthmate sync with Fit@SAP Cloud - pulls only on sync trigger - takes up to 1 day. And check it once with withings server b4 SAP cuz we pull from there only.

Communication - Planning (What all you gotta do and how to prioritize; suggested strategy best approach; precautions (risks), updates) - such trivial things to do, HCM (his nature, why he didn't go home, where worked, does he have bike); CRM - Sardarji - go and say thanks - call him if not visit him. Bangalore temperature (social erp).
	Transactional first and then Connected master data of everything.
	bike servicing - don't give papers and contact the regular servicing folks. Arch and maturity means not getting too pumped by desires, urgencies, fears, etc.
	everything comes from planning only - major component of discussions is planning.

Story - Shared a pizza with a roommate. And also ordered sabjis and stuffs - getting a hang of getting social. Creating a happy ambience around myself.
Discussion - 
	Goats are tastier in India. Pork, etc in foreign cuz they take care of their diets. Chicken - foreign bred for meat vs India tastier - the colored birds.

		make you comfortable, no judgment, talk eth with, hels when alone or hurt. being understood. Nature proclivity, propensity.
		sync of feelings.
GDPR - right to know which resource is being used by which all apps - like microphone on windows, camera; similarly in smartphone - smartphones come with more IO and sensing devices so Android gives RTI.
Taking a ssession or presentation is presenting a world of knowledge - like LA for derivations - dont just say it but do it and address all queries.
IQ - CS - Types of work
	Infra and Platforms
	Softwares
		Data Management - Managing your resources.
			Managing Master, Transactions and Configs for people or things (IoT). Facebook, IoT, Twitter, etc. Can use lots of tools in the market like kafka, redis, etc.
		Implied or Innovation - Cool features - implied informations that you may find really useful - using algos and approximate algos.
			Spark GraphX. IoT+ can be very powerful. Here also analytics is used thoroughly but not over huge volumes.
			There's a lots of fun in connecting different apps, features, capabilities, etc in interest of final users.
	Data Generation - Using its essence as testing for some capability to be used for innovative software.
		Data Engg - analytics (insights into or transformations) over the existing archived or persistent data no matter how big (V3). 
			Pandas and Spark Gen - describe and explore or confirm. DA follows from here.
		Learning - what patterns or information does your data reveal.
			ML for predictions and prescriptions. Spark ML.
SAP - CS - GIT SSH access
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C saurabh.devgun@sap.com
	eval $(ssh-agent -s)
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
	clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	git config --global http.sslVerify "false"
	git clone (ssh_link) - authenticate do you? yes.
		Git Credential manager - OpenSSH - command promp credentials.
	mvn dependency:resolve
		the only problem is that if it is maven modules based project - this won't do it.
	mvn clean install - java compiler not found - configure it in pom and secondly JAVA_HOME or path is used by maven so after that it would work.
vanity patch
Movie - Laddakh warriors
	preparation for extremes, personality devp, younger brother (nanu)
	ultimate purpose of the training being - emerge winner - strategies are important - take advantage of fog (opportunities in adversity), never lose the ground, physical capabilities enhanced and standardized; solve a problem of winning or defending given a situation - in terms of capabilities.
	I was just doing my duty - winning a medal was nowhere in my mind.
	can't forget team - that's what makes the scouts - honor them as ritual.
	marathon run with weight on top. 18 Kg gun and bag 4 Kg but team with you. High altitude less oxygen and severe cold.
		all are serving or preparing to serve their best. bhaichara is important - more than physical it's mental test - you need bravery and zidd.
		gurudvara patthar sahab - teerth sthal and buddists accept guru nanak and buddh guru - guru gompka maharaj.
		many months for this prep and real life prep is going on.
		another marathon 72 Km and these guys make it to top 10.
	training for weapon - assemble and vv. with eyes closed - in matter of secs.
		st with weapon that jams in cold.
		run and shoot - cuz tired and can lose the aim.
		LMG - light machine gun.
		arrow shooting and also competitions - music accompaniment.
	camouflage training. PASS THRU fire smoke - gotta stop breathing and change gun positions.
	crawl under fences.
	climbing on mountain. tools and with bag. ropes and knots.
		Ibacks mountain animal. run but 90 degreee angle and gotta control speed and avoid slippery.
		death if slip and confidence that yes I can do eth.
		changpa kabila - changthang pathar survival.
	snow gliding and fighting.
	war simulation. smoke candles, ghabarahat and afratafri - remove the fear. guidance while that happens - every movement.
		no time to even breathe - make them move and death in real life.
	relp with instructor like feel and emotions - friends relp - we become member of family. Team spirit is deeply inculcated. sing together.
	whatever you do you gotta be god of the arena - khatri to offer best service, business man to offer best service; talent to offer best service and Researcher to offer best service.
	There are always leaders or architects above engineers. The hierarchy always exists - meaning your ability to service at the best that your junior is inspired to serve under.
SAP - New year holidays - magic.
CS - Why use maven modules - 
	Monoliths with tiers vs
	Microservices - separate apps with needed talking with each other. Parition your big app. Even UI becomes a microservice.
		vs DAG of dependendencies from devp space - not outside like MVN - different modules - eg - x4, BAF, Foundation used by all the functional modules simultaneously - if this was the case of parallel functional devp then foundation could be a separate dependency to be used thru maven but we want simultaneous devp so using it.
			Think of this as single dependency of your project which doesn't need to be a separate project until there are many consumers for that jar.
			let's call maven modules as project dependencies only but restricted to the scope of the project.
		vs package - package is within a single focussed app - unique purpose served thru a set of packages.
SAP - CS - Some resources accessible cuz your system has certificate and others need you to be inside the intranet - that's when VPN becomes important.
IQ - mouse lock, volume, wifi lock, 2 port usb, etc.
	ctrl,alt+double click.
	3 KTs - functional arch code X theory, practical.
CS - Text mining in R
	frequency; correlations
	classification naive bayes, 
	sentiments by classification algos; sentiments by function (positive - negative words)
	Topics by frequent unique terms LDA algo.
	Network analysis
	clustering
	NLP - Regex, Processing, Named entities, patterns, topic modeling
	feature extraction, text classification.
	words similarity like king and man. predict next word, spam classification using cnn.
Movie - Tanhaji
	kondhwa sinhgad fort. Make your own sword.
	gorilla warfare - strategic positions to win the war.
	kalyan gate kondhana fort.
	using pulleys to the fullest - how to take up the fort - pulley.
	He got what he truly wanted.
LIB - IQGrats - URL -> App sandbox -> SSH into it -> GITHub of its readme -> shell uses newman command to run postman collection for results.
	Kafka and spark outside sandbox container. IOT Gateway includes device management - sensor, sensor type, capability, etc not in sandbox but writes to raw kafka topic sandbox.
	IOT Gateway url - tenant/device with payload containing sensor info. Even measurements (master, transactional is all handled by gateway).
	IOT Core Services takes care of Thing world master and mapping. Transactional is handled by IOT AE.
	My system is contacting IOT Gateway URL thru JMeter to write something in there - it refuses to recognize me or my system certificate - cuz the keystore ain't proper.
	IOT AE starts with assumption that data is coming on raw topic of a space (sandbox or so) and from there we start - can have a simulation app to write on raw topics.
		performance space doesn't use simulation but they use IOT gateway as well to write into raw topic. Direct writing with mild formatting from sensor - data sent thru endpoints.
		IOT Device like arduino or raspberry pi is responsible to send data to IOT Gateway - of course after initial registration of device, sensor, capability and all.
	E2E delay is measured by DTE but stored in hana db later retrieved by MDS if queried. async of dte keeps writing to de and hana worklist tables from processsed topic.
	Interestingly IOT Core services is written in nodejs. Power of microservices. Reading package.json for git repo.
	IOT Rules master is different team, IOT Thing modeler is apparently a team different from IOT Core services but with mild differences we can't separate them from management perspective.
	SAP IOT has 408 members, 65 teams, 366 repos.
LIB - BeanShell Sampler is where the keystores are being configured.
	Observe the script - it looks for keystore in the current folder - in bin folder it should be there I said cuz that was under assumption that you trigger the program from that directory.
	The beanshell sampler already says look for it in current directory but I ignored it - giving precedence to the senior's words => logic should always take precedence over words.

	Chain - engine and rear wheel.
	Charger - battery is given voltage.
	Chassis - frame of bike. All parts mounted on it.
	Clutch - transmit power from 1 comp to another.
	drivetrain - connect parts together.
	engine - old comps together and produces power. Cylinder, pistons.
	exhaust system - gases are released.
	air filter - dust particles not allowed in engine.
	oil filter - engine oil is cleaned.
	fuel tank - fuel held in there.
	gears - parts of transmission.
	Handle grips
	handlebars - steering mechanism. holds brake, etc.
	Helmet.
	Kickstand
	Lamp - headlight or headlamps.
	Mirror - to see back and front.

	odometer - distance.
	saddlebags - options.
	seating.
	shift lever to change gears.
	sidecar for extra luggage.
	speedometer.
	suspension - on tyres - vibration and noise safety - handling and braking.
	tachometer - rotations per sec when to change gears.
	tyres - tubeless.
	transmission - power from engine to wheel.
	wheels - tubes mounted on it.
	windshield - used by police.
	Choke Switch - morning engine doesn't start - more; engine is cold so more fuel and air reqd.
		Choke giving more petrol - turn on choke switch for more fuel.
		crank in other bikes. Knob, switch.
		keep on for reserve fuel and also for starting the bike in cold.
	engine kill switch
		use - traffic signal - to save petrol.
		safety feature if key is stuck.
		accelerator jam then use it - it will take time to stop.
	Engine start.
	Horn.
	Indicators.
	headlights.
HomeErp - Bike - Battery Dead Problem
	Use kick-start (if that option is available in bike)
	Otherwise, visit the nearest available service station/mechanic/battery repair shop to charge the battery.
	Call on-road helpline of the bike manufacturer (if available)
	Try to Push-N-Start the bike (like they used to start mopeds in olden days). This option may not work with many of the bikes. Not with heavy ones at least.

PIES - Personalize vs Process - always contact a person rather than asking process to work as expected.
Scrum Retro - Tools Parabol
	Reflect - Liked Learned Lacked Longed for.
		Maps to good bad ugly + Learning (abstract and concrete)
		anonymous and timebound.

How can we minimize the work - am I audible; Any ideas - pinpoint a person.
	you came prepared with probs then also ideas for improvements.
	Meeting-less day.
Scrum - Calendar blockings - when stuck then inputs from others - How would approachability work and transfers.
	some handholding for new colleagues - tailoring mode - dedicated 1 hr with buddies and 1 hr of development.
	reverse KT mode - where they come back of questions. This KT by new colleagues - not active members of meeting. Now question is how do I test it while debugging, etc.
	That I am ok with KT is one time effort but setting up system needs availability from devps.
	enabling them is the means - this investment is lacking from our side.
	2 meetings - reverse KT and trouble shooting.
	Action item - you book the reverse KT.
	API made to do primitive checks to help them forward the ticket to right time.
IQGrats - Suggested the idea of natural language processing on BCT tickets based on history.
	History we have - which team finally solved the ticket so use that to train a classification model based on NLP.
LIB - Scrum - We want war but don't have equipments with us - at least have backlog outside of release backlog.
	On any rainy day we try that, are we equipped.
	Looking for development work - this is a specific problem to be looked into.
	Task readiness - checklist b4 a task is picked.
	!DAG of tasks
	Let's add another stage to our jira board - release ready.
	If current functionality doesn't exist we will ask developers to make it. Don't restrict desires based on availability - standardize and plan accordingly but don't shy from take tools to ideal place.
	make claims it has deadline - this is money guys.
	Next time gimme lesser talk time - have no unmute button for meeting - I would rather have no mute button.
	Action items of last retro and what's the status with that.
	analysis - 60 reflections, 36 topics, 14 present.
Withings healthmate sync with Fit@SAP Cloud - pulls only on sync trigger - takes up to 1 day. And check it once with withings server b4 SAP cuz we pull from there only.
Arch - Risks foreseen for future - memory usage will increase if there would be frequent updates (nothing unforeseen left for future - benchmarking of memory usage anticipated etc)
Communication - Planning (What all you gotta do and how to prioritize; suggested strategy best approach; precautions (risks), updates) - such trivial things to do, HCM (his nature, why he didn't go home, where worked, does he have bike); CRM - Sardarji - go and say thanks - call him if not visit him. Bangalore temperature (social erp).
	Transactional first and then Connected master data of everything.
	bike servicing - don't give papers and contact the regular servicing folks. Arch and maturity means not getting too pumped by desires, urgencies, fears, etc.
	everything comes from planning only - major component of discussions is planning.
CS - Kafka
	Apps interact
		Producers - Publishes records to the topics in kafka.
		Consumers - pulls records stored in kafka topics.
	Streams - client library for processing data stored in kafka. Stream processors interact.
	Connectors - a framework to build connectors for in / out movement of data between kafka and other systems. Like DB.
	Intro
		Documentation - Distributed streaming platform. similar to message queue or enterprise messaging system.
		Message system - producers message broker and consumers.
			see the mess with n and m target and source systems. @wire mess.
			vs adapter.
			fault tolerant.
			Store in kafka message logs.
		Stream - continuous stream of messages can be handled. Stream processing apps - read and store back or pass on.

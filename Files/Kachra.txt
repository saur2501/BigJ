            Poetry, Dance, etc included.
    FIN - Undercurrent.
    About - narrative is focus on either networking, Enjoyment or comforts (SRM and SCM Logistics) and money.
PIES - SVAF follow hierarchy - even though they are separate.
    Spirituality use case is to attain sat cid ananda - eternal state of enlightened happiness - thru best love and best service.
    Varna use case is favorable atmosphere for sp (@gamla); Cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for sp (like service)
        In abstraction layer, only use case is service (but for a reason, which is trans).
            Now, this gets hairy at this layer. FDDL incentives for varna - money, power, contributions measurements, love for your craft.
            Domain of your choice (social use case you serve) - your tools - configuration knowledge and POC and combining them aptly to solve a problem.
        other incentives like fear, desire and love (intrinsic) although very powerful, aren't official use case to start with but sure, help and drive the show alone.
        Any task can be better performed when you know the ultimate result it must yield.
    Ashram use case is favorable atm for varna and sp; cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for varna and sp (love, being organized, and being social consumer)
        layer of abstraction use case is enjoyment - love and consumerism (but for a reason and should help higher layers)
        This also gets hairy - FDDL incentives and what all to do in here to be socially smart.
    FND use case is favorable SVAF; cultivating utils for SVAF.
    Applications - so before starting any activity - what is the end result I want.
        Eg - child nurturing - we can't guarantee future but can act in suitable (best) ways that child and others cultivate necessary favorable attitude for varna and spirituality.
        Eg - marry - of course, fear and desire and love but primarily, acting in suitable (best) ways for varna and spirituality for me and others.
PIES - of course, we gotta play at godhead or demigod level to ultimately get there but we will also get checkpoints along the way - like being a businessman, being an admin, guide, etc.
PIES - To cultivate FND we need - knowledge and practice but also Role models, many eg to train over, etc.
PIES - Tolerance is a very important concept. Take anything, you get what you tolerate. LCM emphasizes it, Krishna emphasizes, all yogis practice it.
    There's a penance or tapasya for a goal; on the path of which there are obstacles to be overcome - while it takes determination and discrimination to do it.
    encountering obstacles ain't a pleasant experience. REL get your hands dirty. You must tolerate it.
    You pay the price to get something (price of persistence and tolerance) but also sustaining something be it health in the material world - takes a price (persistence and tolerance)
    immune system works - it solves but we gotta tolerate while it does.
    You tolerate and be a good engineer when all that becomes easy but then you must tolerate next level to be an arch.
PIES - mind is a library - everything you put in - is gonna go in the warehouse to be organized - conscious of what you put inside.
PIES - If only we learn from world politics and warfares - they all show human behaviors at a scale - it's about appeasing population for votes suiting their ideology. It's about winning the desirable ends from creating conflict or resolving an existing one.
    conflicts are always gonna be a fact and how people deal with them has lots of lessons on human behavior.
    FND is human psychology and microeconomics. Ashram is macro social studies and its concrete eg along HomeErp domain and SocialErp.
PIES
    Spiritual Story - extrinsic and intrinsic pleasures.
    Sume development - Chanting Bhajans journey, Yoga Meditation Journey, Knowledge journey, VA journey (donations included) - that's intrinsic pleasures.
    Social validations - whenever 7 said me something - preaching, new comers. Juniors, seniors, equals.
PIES - MOI - In general, sloth or laziness in its gross sense but more profound that you want reward without much investments.
    all escapisms or entertainments also fall under this category - but that's not as bad as high dopes
    So, our entertainments should also be well planned and limited - too much MOI leads to MOI becoming a tendency - attached to MMN so the solution is restricted planned entertainments.
    Even sleep can be seen as bodily requirement (MOG) or fun / escape (MOI)
    Now, not that we pay no price for entertainments - that's why it's MOI tilted but st it can be MOP also.
    Ideal life is MOG based - you decide the best course of action to an end and play accordingly.
    Man nahi karta is a typical MOI saying - I extracted the fun outta it is a MOP saying - we have to rise to MOG - where the pleasure is more sophisticated.
    Even entertainments can be MOG based - planned and serving a purpose rather than fun seeking or driven exercises.
    pure fun seeking entertainments can be planned aptly within threshold like MOP anarthas in threshold.
    There is nothing called pure gold - 24 caret but purer the better - it's like that when SP says 70% pure is enough for BTG - it's difficult to assume that we will stop thinking about self at any point.
        But it's reasonable that more advanced people (even from worldly standards) think more of others than themselves.
PIES - MMN have huge bearing on the SVAF.
    Varna is more in MOP in general but can be practiced in MOG as well - MOI gets disapproved.
    Ashram can be MOP but tends to be more towards MOI - Ashram can also be practiced in MOG if planned properly.
        that's 1 reason why the time slots of Varna is typically higher than ashram.
PIES - The trap of foundation is very clear - when there is no sense of incompleteness felt - no dissatisfaction or discontentment or craving for more completeness,
    and still 1 is forced to act - it does not have that strong fire which a man with yearning shows.
    So, worldly escapes make us feel satiated already - then we question why do I lack the fire to act or we act in luke warm ways - cuz foundation isn't strong.
    that's why spirituality encourages MOG and not breaking 4 regs - cuz that's turning off the fire - the bad foundation will show no fire for the end goal.
    That's not deprivation - SQ doesn't favor denial either but MOG based fulfillment and no escapes or enjoy without paying the price.
    Not breaking 4 regs ensures at least MOP - with more refinement we can move to MOG which are ever better platforms for transcendence. and are closer in themselves to trans.
    Imagine when foundation is proper and you keep on developing your personal self - you will constantly have that fire that you deserve more. How favorable this is to perfection!
PIES - Social applications of PIES understanding
    Spirituality is a layer above SVAF with F being psychology and microeconomics - this clearly indicates that Spirituality can't break the principles of SVAF over which it is itself based.
    If a spiritual school, breaks the society or builds strife among people or is against economic development or is counter to psychology - like suppression (this isn't equal to control or regulate), we need to reject that school.
    if I tell you to do something which is impossible pscyhologically cuz of us being SCA seeking beings by nature - then that proposal has to be rejected.
    There are examples of mass suicides arranged by unscrupulous teachers who said aliens would take them to ever beautiful place if they die in opportune moment.
    If spirituality encourages you to fight with family (not talking trans here) or discourages social contributions - spirituality at its layer above SVAF will break the civilized society principles itself which supported it to exist.
PIES - We are constantly, based on our association, are evolving or degrading ourselves in SVAF (BJDK)
    Parents are natural seniors in Ashram and so on. E1 should also become senior eventually.
    Passing legacy is not just genes (characteristics combinations) - it's also passing mentality, beliefs, etc (combinations of worldly ideals you adore), spiritual (trans)
    Why distinction happens in destinations - it's train directory - you will go depending on which train you choose.
        Some choose the ticket of growing in ESMD to become like pig or pigeon or so. Choosing what's accessible even in lower species
        we have many analogies - best model of car used for farming; Meeting king only asking to put luggage back on head; PM choosing cheap thrills.
        Basically growing in dimension which is not the best bet - you grew for sure in ashram but in dimensions that don't help you spiritually much.
        You didn't choose the best bet of your TME if you chose ESMD or worldly pursuits - which are good in themselves but there is gradation.
    Idol worship vs deity worship but even idol worship is very powerful. Our heroes should be the best.
        How much are they opening up and you are tuning or tapping in - is a foundational differentiator.
        We are like glass - passing light to a certain intensity - parampara people are important for inspiration as living eg but scriptures and Krishna himself ensure light to retain its intensity for a longer duration.
    So even those who degrade themselves still must have evolved but either in a messy way or in dimensions that don't help. Or didn't choose heroes nicely.
    How much Indian am I - depends on defining Indian-ness but also how much I have associated with outside (directly or indirectly like virus - transitive)
        travelled far and wide across India but have also associated with outside - it's ok to adopt best of everything - like opening the window but standing on feet.
        How much Punjabi am I - Movies, friends, comedy nights, parents, relatives, etc.
        "should be" is a separate question.
        How much ML DS or CS am I - who have been my CS journey heroes - abstract teachers (online or offline), concrete heroes (achievers, seminar givers, etc)
    Not just client server associations but also peer to peer associations where you are both client and server with the equals. Eg - parents are seniors mostly and siblings are peers or equals mostly (both server and client in regards of learning)
    Ashram heroes - for empathy, for enjoying, for curious exploration or for learning from - best of talents you idolize and they also open up themselves proving themselves useful in exchange of rewards.
    I am to a certain degree like those that I have associated with in past in SVAF - I am like my teachers, book writers, exemplary heroes, etc.
    You reach BTG when you are like Krishna; just like to enter sun, your body should be firey - SP says above 70% can be taken care of (compile time readiness for BTG and runtime but compile time is more important)
    Always choose to associate with heroes (short term and long term) - even in peers, be with heroes and demonstrate your cultivated heroism.
    It is true that we represent our seniors so it's a responsibility and our juniors represent us so again a responsibility. Even peers create expectations from us so responsibility once more.
PIES - Varna time -> (7-9)-(5-9) And sleep strictly 10-11 to wake up at 5 - plan Ashram and Foundation around this.
    this is also very natural way to work and live.
PIES - Even in SVAF we have Servers, peers and clients
    ensure best quality servers - gratitude and advocate learning from them.
        Eg - Parents, Teachers, etc.
    learned friendly peers - peer approach you for help and you know whom to contact in VA.
        gala time with peers in ashram.
        Eg - Siblings, Spouse, Friends, Peers, etc.
    happy clients - Varna satisfied customers who would advertise for us.
        Eg - Managers, Prospective Leads, Customers, Children, Disciples, etc.
PIES - 3 layers of achievements in the world 
    Getting Krishna thru BJDK Yoga - includes SVAF.
    Creating a legacy 
        giving best service - all individual phases of life adding up to a great service. If it gets famous that's a good thing but not necessary.
    Follow your bliss
        Fun in each discrete phase of life - whether they add up for grand narrative is a legacy thing or extended fun of life.
    More - It's a layer
        so ultimately in life, getting Krishna by the end. But that's not the only thing - we create granularities in phases where each phase is enjoyed in itself and adds up.
PIES - SVAF emerges from the following layers with 2 dimension each.
    Spiritual - Server (Preach) and client (BJDK Yoga)
    Social - Server (varna) and client (ashram)
    Home - Server (Ashram - price) and client (ashram - grat streaming standardizations)
    Personal - Server (hobbies etc - FND) and client (FND - ABCD)
PIES - In all SVAF, we gotta move from being client to being server and peer always.
    Like in ashram, b4 becoming server, we gotta be very organized as client. So, client is phase 1 - organized client is step 2. Next start serving in whatever dept possible.
    There are pure service roles also in SVAF (like parents) but our services should grow over time (towards parents also who are ideal leaders by very nature)
    So, in sume start recording not just how well I enjoy in SVAF in organized way but how well I serve.
PIES - inspired by NFP.
    Walking to the ideals - Socially, home, personally.
        Study the abstract school for SVAF and then see what's missing in the concrete and channel your work in that direction - domain-wise technology can be any.
    what will you do if god doesn't exist - study happiness hunt - how can we maximize our happiness.
        it's not mindless easy cheap rewards but maximized happiness.
        What I really like the most is the love emotion.
    Introspection is what I like the most - I can do this all day. And this is my best self interest also.
        Introspection can be an ideal fallback also in trying situations along with SVAF fallbacks.
    The real problem is that I am unhappy with all in SVAF that I am doing - it is symptom of a problem.
        I have to learn to be happy in SVAF with robustness - no exceptions covering all FOE.
SAP - Interest groups - Games - basketball, volleyball, table tennis, cricket, music, dance, Rangabhoomi, Roadies runners. Sankalpa social services, Karnataka day celebrations.
SocialErp - Street lights showed up in ASR just like Udhampur. Campus of Golden temple.
SocialErp - Driving situations
    Aunty crossing with dhadalla. 
    Dark night no street lights speeding car but people on small vehilcles crossing the road. Estmating the road.
    Sunlight on your face.
    Cow suddenly showing up. Continuous horn and changing the lane unceremoniously but after seeing.
    Road suddenly ends cuz of a lying tractor - continuous horn and brake
    Don't cross a big vehicle without horn and reason that they won't turn.
    Delayed turn to be avoided - don't follow their instruction late - then it's not honoring others on the road.
    High court deep parking and stuck cuz of unscrupulous parking from other makeing a closed loop - left at mercy of 7 to show up on unique edge for us to get our way.
    Forgetting to lock the car, OR open the side mirrors or adjusting the front mirror - need of config.
    Jiju and dog suddenly on the way - frightened leaps towards the car.
IQ - Always work for the love of CSLife and not worldly deadlines - they are just compass - for which direction to work.
IQ - Work like a scientist not just a productive worker - you are the one investigating and going the essence of eth and thru all approaching finally making it work.
    that's why I say computer scientist not computer engineer or computer techician, or computer worker, etc.
IQ - Social validations - company culture, Awards, peer when elicited on a user story, appreciating a user story which you worked on, people coming to you for help, 
    peers taking 2nd opinion from you, your presence was needed during ur vacations, Can't start the meeting without him.
    Extrinsic validations can even be implied - these are IQGrats outside of intrinsic sume based grats - it can thru an IDEA that got appreciated or a casual praise.
    Like a senior saying I see lots of potential in you. List these thru IQGrats which also includes Lapse btw which are intrinsic pleasures from negative axis.
    Group Discussions - Your ideas get recognition. Your contributions to an idea in flow. your opinions or feedback matters
        voice it anyways with pros and cons - that will be at least intrinsic grat.
    Implied praises.
IQ - Manager dissatisfied with peer review from scrum master which was right that as DoD not contributing in transactions.
    I was not bad but distracted. Still solved all the assigned tickets.
        Another ticket assigned to me - I postponed cuz distracted.
        So, direction of TME is the customers of ur TME.
    I was devoted with TME for master while I was expected to be devoted for transactional.
        organizing isn't contributing but preparation for it.
        organizing should not be at expense of transactions - so there's a need for separate time.
    Scrum responsibility for our customer (manager) is desirable to prove that you as asset outweigh the liabilities.
        Also, ur manager or customer ensures best interest thru peers review 
        so, be the star in peers; helping others.
    It pains me to see my customers dissatisfied with me
        the point is what I do about it - act and make plans.
        First need is to be aware about it. It's great to know the concerns ASAP.
        Introspect - Where it went wrong and ensure that it does not repeat.
    I welcome feedbacks and positive pressures cuz they push me outta MOI to which I am somewhat attached.
        How this life is so analogous to VOICE life where escalation isn't necessarily but the right way to do it and should be welcomed.
    Drill down as a manager.
    professionalism SDE2
IQ - Abhijeet Sir once accused of many tickets in CSS - he became DoD that week and there was no ticket left in the queue after that week. What a spirit.
IQ - Salary Trends Average
    Salary = Fixed (Base) + Variable (Bonus + Profit Sharing) - variable can be 1.5L to 20L.
    Fresher - 13.
    SDE 1 (Early) - 1-4 years (10+ - avg 14)
    SDE 2 (Mid) - 5-9 years (20+ - avg 24)
    SDE 3 (Late) - 10-19 years (30+ - avg 28)
    So, Grow to architect level ASAP and then go to business mode in multiple ways
        entrepreneur or business
        your startup
        new product in existing business - intra-preneur
        new features or ideas for the existing product or patents - innovations.
        freelance
    At that phase, the measurements will be how many innovative or unique ideas do I contribute to the global picture.
        in this phase, you don't have 1 direct customer but n direct customers (transitive customers not counted)
            for n customers also, it's not serving by service (efforts added) but serving by product (standardizations - your product to use to deliver, distributed product)
        Other alternatives like MBA for company management, DS, etc make me fresher in those fields which is not good.
            and these fields in general don't have even pay that well unless successful.
            Pressures in MBA life Rakesh Pr said.
        SDE is most rewarding and also does justice to all that I have studied till date in basics, arch, platform or innovation.
    Money - Successful Business Divided by Manforce is your takehome - so startup or MNC - that's the decider.
        This means tie up with the giant is important or tie with the most successful will be most rewarding.
        This means the greater the responsibility over your shoulder, the greater is the reward.
    Security
        Be the critical resource - like in basketball game your contributions are among most important.
        Have the critical dependence - in your absence, team becomes weaker.
        You are not overly dependent on one customer - you always have huge demand in customers or buyers.
IQ - ML in spark.
IQ - TDD is necessary - otherwise we make silly mistakes during our minor changes. Always TDD.
IQ - Time saving strategies - organize or standardize ways of acting. 
    Improve on those standardized ways - like instead of maven build of project - perform it only for module. Eg - cf also smart - only the delta is pushed again not eth.
    reduce the call time by pushing library only once in the code rather than again and again.
IQ - LIB - Stepwise addition to config starting from PHI is next strategy.

    Tuck shop - tasty chatni with samosa; Syami's tie up - got the same flavor once while coming back to ASR from Chandigarh.
        Tie up - it's not mindless asking which works but getting involved with them does - in fact, samosa becomes a minor reward in front of human connections.
        think from vendor's perspective it's nothing but with 20 to be carried - why would I give away - I don't want the feeling of being exploited.
Logs - Story -

    Casual walks and thanks giving for the car movement to Tejinder Veerji - led eventually to Kerela trip that I wanted before. What I story!
        Then in my mind I wanted Rajasthan trip - that was the idea that Surabhi didi came up with - I said yes without 2nd thought. Udaipur trip.
    Stories are always getting created - we just need to pay attention and organize them for discussions.
Logs - Story - Enterpreneurship idea from a dev and even relatives rejected in Pune cuz it has to come from within. Later in BLR also.
    what do you think of doing business - it has to come from inside. I don't do it just based on externals.
Logs - Story - In SAP, with a friend, Discussion on why fal ki chinta na karo. I later would realize that he had bought BG as it is from his drawer.
Logs - Story - Mami's father in Punjab terrorism shooting.
    Dadi also. Neighbors also. Mama's relp also.
    Bro - drinking habit.    
Logs - Story
    Mami's own brother
    Street guy's father was in Jaliyawallah - he was behind - 3 gates so escaped and saw ladies falling and chaos. Marshall law so stealthly returned home.
    Servants very unprofessional
        Syami slapped for asking milk but didn't leave her still cuz of dependence.
        Even bibi - used to drink child's milk.
        Surabhi didi choking under water - bucket upside down - slapped her cuz had asked her to stand for bath.
        A guy pushed didi into drainage with all germs - bath in December so fever - very supportive only tolerating.
        Opening meter searching for sth.
        Carrying a cleaning brush outside - why - I thought you don't need this.
        Pyare's phone stolen by Avatar woodworker's son saying that his phone is lost - sim later found broken over meter.
            Avatar uncle used to say I wish to hand him over to police. He was devoted himself.
Logs - Story - Bhangra in 5th.
Logs - Story - SQ - Wide range of experience in KC -
    Jumping the cliff midnight to enter VOICE with callings.
    Locked inside asking from neighbor's help - who used to complain our sounds but pacified cuz we complied.
        1 even complained police and came to college notice also - said we are competent; MBA; stop going they said.
        Sometime no instrument playing; time slots for practice in KGP.
        KGP ghee experience, clothes buying, medicines, cycles lost, heavy rain stuck with dev, hitting street light gasping for air, 
        buying milk products KGP, exploring KGP on cycle like it's home - VTW, STW. Waking up just b4 train would leave.
        Dev little strife solved thru a vaishnava bhajan for the spirit.
    Seen all kinds of jacks - drying clothes in bus, using luggage cabin (after taking tickets), heard of devs pulling chains for mala, etc.
    Sleeping on train floor with newspaper, Bedbug problem chosen, unplanned sleeping at gulmarg, train different seatings and jacks; spot bookings, worst locals trains,
    opulent hotels - shared NIT hostel, cubicle room NIT, IIITB, Infy hostels, IOT lightings, mattress - memory, spring, ortho, etc.
        PG seen, Rental shared rooms. Driving - Cycle, Bike, Car.
Logs - Story - Saw an alpha pet dog walking by barking dogs like he is the king there and there's nothing all of them combined can do against him.
Logs - Story
    Campfire or bonfire fun in Udhampur, 
    Cow buffalo under train.
    sleeping for trains.
Logs - Story - Papa selected in AIIMS twice but refused such silly mistakes cuz no career guidance.
    May even seem foolishness - initially not more into acads for research but M.Sc. awesome theses and same topic - recruited - help them from tomorrow.
        Interviewed but didn't want so didn't even go to check the results - reprimanded by the teacher.
        Any article writing, etc - always excelling the expectations.
        Hesitation only at joining but once joined then exceeding expectations. Full investment into it.
    Huge fan following of the work that people of calibre that they recommend AIIMS director once and work starts. But unscrupulous person protecting his cubicle from sharing used cuss words for having to share and he was put off.
        may seem too much of a stubborn person but that's how it was.
        Another time some HOD of GNDU recommended to AIIMS - the director so sharp that we had met b4 but he didn't join without information but JMC offering more so that one preferred.
        That was also a story - late submission of application and impressed to the extent that personal letter came asking to join.
Logs - Story - Appointment with psychiatrist to hear my story and get money.
EQ - Civics - yes while females are disadvantaged in some ways and carrying a certain kinda subtle body with somewhat greater distance from perfection - they are also favored by transcendence
    thru sheer natural compulsions, limitations and social structures - they end up with lot of service attitude and proclivity towards spirituality.
    So, learn or take inspiration from this spirit of service attitude, etc. like Sita.
    From males we can learn sense of responsibility or dependability, being a leader (alpha) like Hanuman.
EQ - Social Validations - remarks thru incidents that is so funny. That's so unique. Identity based praises he is so funny or poetic.
    Your knowledge is exquisite in this regards. That's an amazing story or you are a great story teller - involvement in a story - what about you choosing that.
    GD - the same remarks when offered by you and listened intentfully by others are also grats.
    All mentioned flavors of IQGrats with their social twists show up here - so this study is more foundational in a way.
EQ - Your presence is celebrated like online interviews - why? cuz fun interactions. cool reveals, trivia, etc.
    even you celebrate others presence cuz that's a grat itself.
EQ - Game - make 6 with 2 hands.
EQ

CS - Maven - Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-war-plugin:2.2:war (default-war) on project spark-services-job-submitter: Error assembling WAR: webxml attribute is required (or pre-existing WEB-INF/web.xml if executing in update mode)
    Add maven war plugin also along with spring plugin
    <plugin>

        <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>

                <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
CS - Code Review
    remove the hardcoded credentials
    remove commented code
    remove not really needed parts like this class serves no purpose
    Avoid using print stack trace - plan the exception hanliong properly.
    You don't override comments from previous team - that's like insulting the reviewer.
    remove unwanted dependencies from pom - use properites when recurring versions.
    always avoid sysouts - logs for production readiness
    avoid constants in the code - read from property file.
    Follow standards for naming - self explanatory in the large picture - name => respnsibile person.
    Don't write credentials in code even for testing - that's like revealing a lot to possible seers of the code.
CS - Spark Cassandra - Cannot build a cluster without contact points
    cuz url can actually not be found - it had extra quotes
CS - Code Cleaning
    Never say flag == true.
    logging or something use string formatting than concatenation potentially risky.
    use isEmpty instead of size less than 1.
    private final vs private static final (final should preferably be static always else duplication in memory)
    sanitize main command line args - don't expose anything to random user including inputs.
    Also an effort required for exceptions proper tracing in the FOE.
    Test your code thoroughly for completeness and robustness (exceptions FOE)
        So, need JUnit Tests (with Mockito if needed) and Code go through for exception handling.
CS - CF - Logs didn't have messages and the postman calls were failing - cuz it was not fully deployed so 502 was not from upstream but from the app itself.
CS - json-diff
CS - cf restage app doesn't reset the bindings so previous credentials continue to work.
    cf push also doesn't change binding - only after delete and push that bindings need re-work.
    cf ssh debug once started - after every push, we must respect the debug session; else it will continue giving 502 until you delete and create app afresh.
CS - Code Cleaning
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); in case of interrupt exception during sleep.
    Environment.get(VCAP_SERVICES).asString().ifPresent(vcap -> jsonObject.put(VCAP_SERVICES, vcap));
CS - GIT - sometimes we invoke git add from module and the changes outside the module don't make it to the remote repo and jenkins in git complains.
CS - Maven - use surefire plugin for testing (after 2.22.2 else junit not supported).
CS - Code Review - it's perfect to see only the delta with the master - that way only relevant merge changes visible - focus only on feature or fix in question.
    Function testing besides jenkins external tests not possible hence attaching proofs of run can be a requisite for the merge process.
    Unit tests for code sanity is desirable and ensures code coverage and clean code thru SonarQube.
    Thus the code quality process has been automated to a good degree.
CS - Not able to connect to VPN thru big ip - problem was compliance I had to update my mac version.
CS
    any() not supported for return it is mistaken for next argument.
        using supplier argument vs string - prefer string one.
        eq("false") - if other args are any().
        For generics and supplier - Matchers.[Supplier[EventRepository]]any())
        Group by class groups or file names patterns.
        Java method returns 1 healthy result and many Exception to translate into a proper user message.
    All versions now coming from properties.
        TDD development is made sure of.
        All scenarios for the FOE of abstraction of stories covered.
CS - Command line offering many python programs - fails to run cuz pyspark lib missing.
    Works fine in pycharm with the pyspark installed and arguments passed. IDE uses its own interpreter.
    Library has reference to SparkSession but runtime will need SPARK_HOME.
    Now, Jupyter notebook.
CS - SPARK Installation step by step guide
    JAVA_HOME - internally gonna be used by latter. JDK in turn.
    HADOOP_HOME - with winutils.exe added to its bin.
    SPARK_HOME - added to the path.
    PATH - add SPARK_HOME.
    spark-shell confirmation - scala prompt run an eg.
        the program internally uses the variables to invoke services from the servers or rather processes.
    PYSPARK_PYTHON - assuming python3 exists on your machine. Avoid warnings for python don't use 2.7
        variable using internally by pyspark program to run - set it to anaconda's file location python.
        so it will use this python for runtime and internally use the pyspark library for spark interpretations.
    pyspark confirmation - prompt visible and run an eg.
    run using a pycharm IDE - with any python but pyspark library added as dependency. Eg should run just fine.
    run using jupyter - install findspark in anaconda prompt and use import findspark and findspark.init() - sometimes even explicit path helps.
CS - LIB
    Wiki - Specifications and architecture. Link to GITRepo. Revision needed.
    GIT Wiki - Theory behind the code and Detailing the Repository but hands on starts.
    GITRepo - How to use the code. Wiki reference.
CS - Test build succeeds and then another build starts which fails - Close the PR and open again to retrigger the jenkins pipeline.
CS - Maven - remove plugin (JACOCO - JAVA Code Coverage) from parent using plugin specification and configuration skip to true.
IQGrats - Habit of this.port = port while it had to be this.port = value - 
    case misplacement - causing 2 services.
IQGrats - Syami saying your sitting is awesome.
    should not fear laziness cuz once in a while exception is ok - mar mit nahi jaana - getting paid for the day - ok exception and can even be honest about it or explain it away.
IQGrats - winning many arguments and accepting also while discussing with Ajay.
    My ideas accepted for derivation jobs by Ashok. Many ideas accepted in different phases of discussions.
    Understood the strengths and weakenesses of all the peers - so really knowing the stuff working on. Helpful colleagues is characteristic of SAP.
IQGrats - Even when I had covid and it was difficult with cough, fever and headache still I was solving complex problems in SAP IOT - so really devoted to my varna.
IQGrats - SAP IOT Spark services connections was quite a journey - it was a very learning experience and I got to explore all the terrains just like for different space Performance POC.
    thorough discussions and senior colleagues welcoming for weekends discussions.
    learning their approach of doing things and discussing their suggestions - validation over the best outcome - we will finish this big story.
    When their mature ideas also come as suggestions.
    I don't have to fear laziness for 1 day cuz I make up for it the very next day with huge overtime - our field itself is so interesting.
IQGrats Giving right answer, reason and wait
    For ticket solving - Ask, Involve, delegate.
IQGrats - Lapse - If it ain't working as expected from the code, simulate the exact same situations from the tool. So, this is also a parallel test like local code or working large scale code but thru the tool.
    Also, bust the clutter thru only unique thing to be testing in debugging - promise eth else works fine or get away with them.
    Helping mentality - always help as a service, with inputs and outputs expected - so reduce help to a service call to a person when we are the server or client.
    And let them resume after a help or even direction of help is extended.
IQGrats - Lapse - CS - LIB - In CF App, Why 502 after I push - gotta connect with ssh for no 502 - reason being you keep the debugger and tunnel on. That's why.
IQGrats - Imran discussion great helps but don't change returning config in validation and SJS ain't DIUtils Lib.
IQGrats - Helped Ashok with ServiceNow UXD ideas.
IQGrats - IDEA - Spark job stopping cuz of one tenant fast producing data in its kafka topic doesn't seem right 
    spark job should be robust to handle this thru exception handling for only this tenant - raise info over email or slack channel.
    Yes, and also auto-reset offsets committed offset to -1 so as to start picking from the earliest from then on.
    And if need be, set earliest offset = latest offset - to forget all produced data and get rid of the lag.
IQGrats - Lapse - Why chisel tunnel not binding although says connected cuz my localhost url was bad, or port ain't available or remote address and port combination ain't right.
    Chisel credentials to be verified, etc.
IQGrats - My assumption that topicName1 or baseURL1 exists in the remote was wrong - what you see is what you get.
    The previous response assertion was successful cuz it checked only for status and not externalId - the problem was the topicName1 not found only.
    So execution of perf was justified cuz during the processing it did go into error not the job status but the processing.
FND - Communication - Jokes involve involving different sources of information - Modiji lockdown lagate lagate haanf gaye yahaan ye corona hone par dance kar rahe hain.
    Change the context or reference - like layer of vision - like in comedy circus suddenly reminding them outta role into their real life.
    Ambiguity advantage, OOP jokes punjabi, etc.
FND - NFP - tattoo, artistic, design, outfits, tasteful, head towel, open or unmasked, hollywood posters, Age dimension, dress dimension.
    It interferes with my immune system. It interferes with my TME investment on other dimensions worthy of investment.
    How much TME do you invest on your goals.
FND - NFP - I am almost done with story of cultivating grats here. Now the story is mostly gonna be about how I got rid of this extremely deep rooted sanskar and vritti.
    Since birth it has been deep. Next, thru my life actions instead of curbing it, I have nourished it - culture could have helped and also could have hurted - I chose both with some bias towards latter.
    My solution phase has gone thru many phases. Some of them are follows
        Prayashcit Paschattap Phase - helped me a lot.
        Maximize layered grats - helped me a lot at the next level.
        Structured Streaming of layered grats - Config of Arch - this is gonna work wonders this addresses the problem at much closer to root level.
            The problem being - Life gets boring with streaming not proper or impedance in the streams - boring life or pain points in life.
            We gotta cultivate tolerance stamina (called grit) to avoid the pain points (iow, challenges - which should rather be choosed than accepted) 
            and proper plans or solutions to the streams impedance.
            For boring life or streams of grats not being proper across the layers (SVAF) - We need to have a thorough plan (IQ World) or lifestyle (abstract concrete mix) or approach (ask when in problem; seek help from managers; change, etc)
                And we should have alternatives and persistence to go on till we solve the tough challenges and experience far more grats.
                We need external validations and internal validations for SVAF - these incentivize SVAF in a huge way. So think along these lines - use concrete and abstract tracks. Short term and long term plans.
            When there is a pain - this acts as pain reliever or escape mechanism. When life is boring - this becomes a go to point - solution is have alternatives and reduce the need itself.
            Counters is a great help for this.
    The power of focus - I will get superpowers when I will focus my TME to SVAF specific goals - that's the key 
        super awesome people in world do extra-ordinary feats cuz first they want it strongly and second they are willing to pay the TME price.
        So, yes if you practice NFP along with avoiding distractions or escape mechanisms in other places like ignorance or extreme MOP - then you are bound to get super powers but in the direction you choose - one is free to still choose no direction.
    My life is SVAF - Spirituality in BJDK SQ and VA for KY primarily. F is the Fuel for all.
        I don't want just good VA or doing outta compulsion - I wanna do it outta interest or extreme fun - being in love with it - external validations and internal validations.
        of course, V has greatest portion in the day. Next we have Personal (Spiritual and FND).
        Ashram has lesser hours in the workday and more in weekends - but is very pivotal and has high importance - even directly satisfy the mind with lesser price and more rewards.
FND - NFP - Lick; Replay - Normalization based
    P should be taken seriously - it's a small lapse which should be accepted. If you don't sequence will follow.
    Sleep should be valued - Learn how to increase the value of sleep when it's time - thru affirmations, retros over the day, planning next day and deep breathes.
    It's all about microeconomics - I choose what I value the most with my TME - I really think indulgence is more valuable than abstinence.
    Instead of days let's have a 15 weeks redirection protocol.
        I will have journal with what's the week's personal agenda, and a topic or book focus. At least I owe it to myself.
FND - NFP - Week 1 - Win Friends book. Also sleep on time.
    Measurements journal - ??
FND - NFP - masked only specific parts. Unmask specific parts.
FND - NFP - Fallbacks in life or in situations can be multi-layered. The latter the better.
    Shelter of lust (or likes) - better still, if it's not anti-devotion
    Shelter of worldly love (or love talks - poetry, songs, etc.)
    Shelter of transcendental peace.
    Shelter of spiritual love.
FND - it is most important to be internally strong. So, do the needful.
FND - NFP - only in week 2 and I could see notable differences.
    Good sense of humor, very talkative, very active at responding, excellent recall of stories.
    These are many times experience of mine - of course, there was also investment in those lines not just streak days.
    So, my observation says NFP gives power which when channelled in any field yields excellent results.
FND - Book - Awaken the giant within
    Exercises - list your values - contradictory or empowering also disempowering ones.
    Beliefs or rules for life.
    Identity - must conform to.
    Emotional state you are in - physical affects your emotional state.
FND - NFP - Big Data Streaming phase of PIES arch is where the next powerful thing is gonna happen
    There is a spontaneous interest in it - even when not triggered, there is a call for enjoyment.
    Is it a sorry state? Not really - the sorry state is the stakes of Big Data Streaming (Distributed and Structured Streaming) is still not ruling the show.
        There is a still a competition that's the sorry state - I need to worry that progress pull should be greater than restrictive pull.
        Progress pull should be disproportionately high.
    The only way to make it abate is to make the other wolf stronger - Taoism - black shrinks as the white grows.
    There is no need to list more of NFP dimensions and list of values it can take
        just the idea of permutation, combination of everything along with all life dimensions should be enough.
        Now the real listing needs to be how we channel our strengths and not how we spend them. It's time for big data streaming.
Sume - IQ - using design patterns in projects
    Mememento pattern in BYD NSME - to undo for atomicity of a transaction. State Design pattern proposed instead of graph framework but not used. Appreciated by colleagues through.
    Visitor pattern, command pattern, template method pattern witnessed.
    Siemens - witnessed singleton and factory pattern.
    SAP IOT - witnessed following
        For refactoring monitoring code - adapter pattern, decorator proposed but rejected for refactoring
        For spark services connectivity check, witnessed 
            builder pattern - Factory used but rejected in favor of builder cuz we won't have a spark job but directly let consumers use our library.
            Null pattern to give a default services behavior; Mememento pattern only glimpse to reset options to null after usage.
            Facade pattern supported under the builder pattern - instead of adding all service credentials one by one - give the vcap which internally uses all the methods like options, add, connect (or build)
        Observer pattern witnessed for kafka scale up or scale down.
Sume - Maven many plugins - dependency plugin to copy, shaded plugin for uber jar, scala plugin, war plugin, etc.
Sume - EQ - I feel fortunate to be born in Punjab and of my family member therein.
    I personally feel Punjab is culturally among the best even in India in terms of spiritual favorable culture - south India also has it being separated but see non-veg, etc is far more.
    our people are decent, not vulgar, spiritually inclined, politically smart, socially smart, vegetarians in high percentage, vocally smart etc.
    I am fortunate to travel and explore different places - all special in their own way.
Sume - AWS, SCP, Azure in SAP IOT. DoD work.

Sume - FND - I had started to use apps for exercise in BLR; also lifting bed for weight lifting.
Sume - Paypal - ability to trace hive query to its hadoop equivalent. Also how to translate any MR to hive query.
    Abstract or Spirit
        If you write it in sume then expect follows - knowledge questions, practical application questions, understanding questions, present experience.
            Ability to write architecture (High level knowledge). Gimme spark architecture - scribble the HDFS, etc.
            Ability to write practical solutions to problems (think a problem in exercises in a book). Eg - if you say Hive, then answer this random question.
            Given a solution you should know different way to tweek (your powers in the programming world). Understanding every statement and other statements that you didn't write - whole data or programming model with configs.
        Challenges encountered in every endeavor - ability to discuss - how friendly fun interaction this can potentially be.
        Experience - quote your experience. How much can you talk about a given experience or tool therein.
    Concrete
        General - tell you general and relevant experience
        Write the architecture of spark.
            not comparison with MR but architecture.
        Hive query - optimized query with no duplicates - return latest row update - use partitioned by and window.
            rate yourself on scale 1 to 5.

                        using spark streaming to write at 1 place and retrieve from another 
                        OR Consuming Spark Job results over SJS or so.
                    Given a transactional user story - the data from the user story is online learning for many models and also consumer of many trained model.
                        Either same process or different process.
            Persistence - All kinds, even message queue, etc.
Sume - SIOT - VPN heavy usage. CF debugging thru IntelliJ, Spark Kibana logs. SonarQube, Code Cleaning. JUnit, Mockito, MockMVC, Maven surefire plugin.
Sume - Monitoring spark jobs while platform update happens in against CF spaces in different landscapes.
Sume - Strategy pattern for all the Unit testing.
Sume - Scrum, TDD, Waterfall, etc.
SQ - AN is primarily about BV to SV - svarth to paramarth. Selfishness to extended self.
    KY - thru VA service or Dharma finding the ultimate expression of union.
    JY - tattva darshan thru sattva path - DMPM.
    DY - life of absorption meditation - yam niyam practices to be able to do that.
    BY - 9 stages with anartha nivritti being from svarth to paramarth
        (maps to sattvik life JY; maps to yam niyam DY; maps to dharma parayan KY) primarily done thru Bhajan kriya (maps to tattva darshan or nididhyasanam; maps to meditation; maps to dharma parayan action)
        BK to AN maps in JY stages (Mananam to Nididhyasanam); DY stages (Pranayam to Pratyahar); KY stages (Dharma samashti - e1 to srishti - constitutional)
        Following this there's nishtha (Preaching) and growing interest in transcendence (Dharana Dhyan in DY; Sakshatkar in JY; parameshti in KY)
    This is more difficult to get perfection cuz it's a lifetime course and conglomerates all the yogic paths - common people can still perfect in stages and in other ages.
        The toughest road is that of anartha nivritti - getting across unfavorable after picking the favorable.
        Many don't even pick up the favorable whole heartedly so where's the question of next stages.
SQ - Actual purpose of all of SVAF is spiritual but incentivized by Krishna in other ways as well - FDDL.
    Krishna has made such a sweet arrangement for evolution - where in every SVAF situation we have seniors (servers), equals (peers) and juniors (clients)
SQ - All preachers are at least on nishttha stage (for stability) so kindly respect them mentally properly.
SQ - Representatives of God in this world
    Seniors and Care takers - SM, Devas, Rishis, King, Customers or guests, Parents, Nature, etc.
    Similarly Chanakya Pandit on 7 classes of mother or motherly or mother-like behavior (along some important dimensions, of course)
        ?There's also a conception of transcendental mother.
    Although Representatives they don't change the fact that to represent and to be ain't the same thing but similar. Accessible.
IQGrats - Lapse - I was search for /Things in project but in REST by spring, path can also be specified as @Path("Things")
    This was solved by getting handle for v2/Things and locating the file and searching in its vicinity.
    Next, Another manifest.yml is maintained at the maven parent project path - but sets the path for main deployable module only so no problem there 
    basically intended to avoid having to go to child module to push an app to cf.
CS - 1 way of finding execution trace of a code is to backtrack using file hierarchy - what writes to kafka - which class and thus we reach to which API called it.
Sume - CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) DS
    1.5 crore records and many columns.
    Installed anaconda, anaconda navigator launched.
        Anaconda installed in the applications folder in mac.
        Downloaded file remains at download folder.
    4.2 GB loaded from csv in 80 sec (in unicode). And Hardware resources challenged to their limits.
        2 GB file is tough to handle for simple PCs but under that is a breeze.
    3 sec to make a column numeric with 1.5 crore records.
    10 license for 1 medallion (1700 entries for that medallion)
        license - all the travels by a driver.
        But unique medallion for a given driver_license.
        1 license - 1, 6, 1, 4 medallion.
    hack license = permit, license
    Using sql query it is clear that evenings 6 to 8 are busiest.
        union of the 2 is the best bet for this also.
    Another alternative approach would be to write lambda function to count hours for every interim journey.
        Same idea can be applied to busiest locations also but that would be foolish to do extra effort.
            It's really foolish cuz of bad assumptions that all coordinates in middle are used (locality of reference).
            2 tracks A to B and C to B - may seem reasonable to take point D that both will pass through but that's ill informed 
            maybe A to B thru E and C to B thru F and D is least used path or impossible coordinate.
        Need a heat map for busiest locations using only pick up and drop - both.
    Make reasonable assumption for calling trips - round off to 3 digits.
    DS - QA will need no automation. Nor will problem solving take. But models made if complex or using pipeline will involve some small automation.
        but this automation is nowhere close to what SDE folks are used to.
    medallion, hack_license, vendor_id, rate_code, store_and_fwd_flag, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, passenger_count, trip_time_in_secs, trip_distance, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude
    medallion, hack_license, vendor_id, pickup_datetime, payment_type, fare_amount, surcharge, mta_tax, tip_amount, tolls_amount, total_amount
    Pandas can't handle join of 2 2GB tables - spark is powerful it can easily join 1.5 crore records.
        18,307,944,547 - 18 Billion records.
    where abc1.medallion = table2.medallion and abc1.` hack_license` = table2.` hack_license` and abc1.` vendor_id` = table2.` vendor_id` is not enough
        too many records because the person A with Taxi T working for Vendor V - charges n people and makes m trips over a month - merging them is cross product across them.
        include at least the same day.
    Lapse - Thought of pickup_datetime as payment_datetime - merging is piece of cake if that's the case.
        With payment we had to make sure that payment in within the range of start and end trip or within tolerance of that and therefore ensure that another trip doesn't eat that up.
        There is no late payment getting adjusted for another trip - bad dirty data.
    Smartness of join thru spark and writing csv and reading thru pandas.
        now we can also revise the number of passengers per trip.
    After trying different methods without tracing the learning over observations, finally decision tree was performant with lesser error 
        but thru R2 it was only as good as using means cuz some observations would go entirely haywire.
        What does this mean - we can improve a lot - Next move would be tracing.
        And then using ensemble methods for learning.
        Further still, there is a possibility of using neural networks or deep learning for regression
            yes, deep learning supports regression also - in the last layer we replace classification with regression.
        Deep learning should be the last resort to avoid overkill and overfitting - and also, the learning is untraceable but error over time is observable.
    Realization about DS field
        Neither fun, nor money, nor adding up from past for best service, different from CS, And it's simple - just unexciting effort.
        Best way to decide is to live it for a short time and you will know.
        It's surely innovation and utility but not worth changing a field for.
    DS
        Established for fact that medallion isn't a trip code cuz it was not already informed.
        Busiest hours - 2 flavors - discrete hours vs any hour starting any time.
            1st is easier problem using sql on standard bin size.
            2nd can seen with smaller bins diagram.

    what is talli - different language looking for bell - will ask somebody but even the helpers indicated talli would be near trunk and went inside with door closed.
    Brahmins offering first those days - 1 tall muslim used to stand in street and she used to feel horrified seeing him - dhat dhat outta nowhere - ki hoya, koi daka pai gya. She ran away - imagine his response.

        COVID time high casualties. No free hosptial, Oxygen shortage and Mutated virus.
        Going to the house for afsos - this time is not suited for elderly people anyways.
        Whether to go and make yourself vulnerable (with really high probability) OR to not go and appear disinterested (but people will understand)
        compare the weightage - with 1 it's little good of formality (they are grown and can handle it + there are more + e1 know elderly are affected).
            With another, it's potentially a lot bad.
        I involved Syami cuz I knew which way the outcome would go in spite of earnest effort from me and mama - involving didi would mean lots of aggression
            also Syami doesn't go well on decision making fronts with her.
        With his little ideas and discussions, Papa agreed although it was most difficult for him - dharma sankat then any decision makes you feel bad but we have to choose the lesser bad option.
        for once even I thought maryada was more important than life itself. This happened after Syami dropped the phone cuz he could not accomodate Surabhi didi on call.
    Attention required while buying from hawkers - You didn't give money for kulcha. Vatta being wrong.
        Alu kulcha from dhaba - any dang rate was told, asked owner to make bill - the gap was 25%. Even with veggies owner if you don't compute, they may get away with adding 10-20 Rs more.
CS - Machine Learning
    scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. On the other hand, SciPy is detailed as "Scientific Computing Tools for Python". ... scikit-learn and SciPy are both open source tools
    Sklearn is built on top of Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and is simple and efficient for data analysis. However, while Sklearn is mostly used for machine learning, PyTorch is designed for deep learning. ... Ease of Use: Undoubtedly Sklearn is easier to use than PyTorch.
    So, both TensorFlow and PyTorch provide useful abstractions to reduce amounts of boilerplate code and speed up model development. The main difference between them is that PyTorch may feel more “pythonic” and has an object-oriented approach while TensorFlow has several options from which you may choose.
    TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it's built-in Python

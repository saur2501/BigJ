Why use chisel tunneling - for safety - one thing is deployment inside intranet and not public exposed.
    but still not every call from within intranet entertained - only those which have connections thru tunnel.
had to restart the app after db change for postman to recognize the change. also commit work after query.
opening for him not me then cache problem - open incognito - worked.
cf deployment failing - cuz class not found - this class come from json-smart artifact -
    so, drew mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose and verified that had only test dependency and not compile one so removed the test scope.
    Started working fine.
cf push timing out - so solution used my personal internal to upload.
1 more time this deployment failed cuz I removed the scope in child module pom and not in the parent project pom.
Another problem relative path in the pom - meant that I had to clone git repo at the relative path in order to have the things included in the jar.
No classdef found on running from scala sdk for intellij
    cause of problem that maven dependencies not included - but only the main class compiled thru mvn cmd tool.
    IDE has to take trouble of setting classpath without which it can't run - without class path for .class files of maven jars, no class def found was returned.
    scala plugin would be used for compilation from mvn cmd but scala downloaded used for running in intellij - which one to use for debugging as source - prefer the jar but former also ok.
    if difference in versions like minor version then some lines distance is possible during debugging.
ctrl+A, and E in mac command prompt to go to beginning.
Size of jar is too much for cf to handle to start with - too many packages downloaded and it is shitting itself.
Need devp access for staging space in order to get kafka keys from the service instance. If not, their performance user - needs dev access and only Severin can do it.
    He is offline since morning must be one leave.
    Spark skeleton is ready - need to add casssandra and redis to it
    Kafka I have added but not working - haven't got time to work on it.
IOTS Instance or IOTAE instance created means nothing but that tenant has come into our records at the 1 place deployment.
    the iot gateway or authorization server has given them credentials - one time and runtime.
    Our deployment just knows about them. And they have their unique UAA server instance (in their CF) to talk to our deployment authentication server.
All tenants (customers) throwing 1000 instruments - every instrument throwing data at like every 10 ms - so gotta handle 1 Million records per sec
    and if they are buffered to be sent after 10 sec then 10 M records to deal with every 10 sec batch.

With 1 added steps under stepconfig the calls are passing through - without the need for staging dev access
    after consultation with abhishek jain
    tenant iots url going into hibernation mode - Ashok checked they do it to reduce POC - so whitelisting request has been made thru BCP.
    csw-migration - deployment has been failing due to container size but interestingly today morning it worked. That's what I am doing right now.
    Spark connectors - I will contact sb.
num_things - first all those objects, devices are created - so that time - better I should have minimized this number.
    at ingestion step IOTS could not write to the raw topic. Saying 401 which means they didn't have the certificate for the same.
Which means we face this bug due to subsequent conditions:
    Our Spark < 2.4.1
    1.1.0 < Our Kafka < 2.3.0
Kafka consumer saying leader not available - set advertisement host and port to localhost:9092
Kafka - source option "failOnDataLoss" to "false".
    but it worked even without setting it - although debug option closed the spark job continued to do its thing.
    I don't have maven based project - let me not do RDD thingy.
    Let me also give preference to batch reading of kafka thru spark although there is a way to stop the query after n sec.
IOTS application component - BC-NEO-SVC-IOT
    An IOTS instance (https://5b835fca-919a-4caa-b433-437f5b183ec2.canary.cp.iot.sap) has hung after performance run which could have resulted from creating multiple sensor types and sensors.
    Could you clean up the system so that it could be usable.
CCB - Current Cloud Backlog
    Find out the projected revenue for next year - divide 2 year subscription equally over every month and thus calculate next years projected revenue.
    TCO is anyways standard and needs be less than that.
    Your bonus depends on CCB - thus incentivising sales team to get new, get renewals so gotta give support well, avoid dropouts or TCO losses.
        Bucket - new water, leakage and sustained water - height be maintained meansured by CCB.

Background job running in cloud for internal tenants cleanup - it is moved to hibernate for TCO reduction - https://github.wdf.sap.corp/iot/tenant-whitelists
    gotta raise a ticket to BC-NEO-SVC-IOT to whitelist my IOTS tenant.
TODO - add Tenant to tenant list.
yes it is placeholder only and can be changed
    what he added was - find out the tenant id for a given subdomain name - so ?some zone id details finds out the tenant id (different guid and id)
    somehow it determines it as 18 prefix and even IOTS launches with that id - but the mapping between Abstract and Device already exists with 16 prefix
    the original prefix with which the tenant was created - so that's confusing part - but we just need to change this mapping once more and retrigger it.
    The mappings must be existing from previous runs it seems. How it changed after cleaning is a mystery for now but don't care.
    We need to change the mappings following some steps
The source of lapse was incorrect and different versions for spark-sql-kafka - kafka spark streaming is not even required and the scope has to be correct - not provided or test.

    your conf that you ran on UI, used the cached metadata info regarding the IoTS entities(i,e Sensors ST and capabilities) so that step went through and it was throwing 401 during Ingestion, But the main problem is even that IoTS metadata doesn't exist now (coz the IoTS tenant was cleaned)
    So when I try to create an AM object with a new name, It will try to create respective IoTS entities , for that it has to retrieve info from IoTS tenant , and currently its trying to read from the IoTS tenant which doesn't exist anymore
    IOTS tenant deleted and new one created. IOTAE - Abstract entities created and updated with device model and then ingestion happens and recorded.
    Now the IOTS tenant (containing device model) is completely deleted - IOT AM tries to create structures but no need cuz already there and mapping we don't worry.
    But if you change abstract model details and name - then new entities created in AM and attempt to create device details in IOTS but since the mapping is wrong - it fails with 404.
    The solution is we gotta update the mapping or even remove the mapping and start with a clean slate.
First deployment is in the intranet - next, not e1 on intranet can access (with credentials) the hana deployment service.
    only chisel which has authorization to access can access by supplying the credentials ae:RIAN user password with authorized chisel for tunnel.

SQ - Krishna is not good or bad - nor are we supposed to stay till this realm - we gotta transcend to the realm beyond good and bad
    BG Krishna says he is both good and bad but being conditioned we want good or bad in terms of grats - we have to rise beyond.
    Why Krishna did sth to sages in past like Hiranya's time - cuz even they had to rise beyond good and bad in terms of experiences.
    Good experience give a great incentive and thus facilitate progress but so can bad experiences sometimes.
    That doesn't change his being supreme well wisher - cuz best self interest is not getting what we want conditionally but constitutionally.

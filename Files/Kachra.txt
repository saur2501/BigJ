EQ - I should love not only family, but also friends and relatives, next I should love my city, state, country and world (meaning people in there).
    This is what ashram entails as its goal.
CS
    If you don't use @Lazy, the framework creates a singleton bean at the application startup and makes sure that the same instance is autowired and reused in all other dependent beans
    REST Controller is multithreaded - It is not the case that the controller will block all subsequent calls while busy. It is multithreaded.
        REST controller is multithreaded as the DisptcherServlet handles multiple requests from the clients concurrently and serves using the respective controller methods.
        Your controller is a singleton by default and your service is singleton by default too.
        So, to make them thread safe - make sure that the operations that take place inside the service must be thread safe
        Use @transactional annotation in spring or implement it yourself.
        We can test this thru a variable increment - have a class with a variable able to take 3 values.
            Let the returned value increment over every call.
    Thread safe - lots of threads in a process will traverse thru a given object (class instance) methods.
        A class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads,
        regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of those threads by the runtime environment,
        and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of the calling code.
    Web App - starts with premise of n threads for n requests
        but nothing shared across threads except singleton objects and static class members - variables and methods of the class.
        All threads have different class instances to run on without a problem - nth shared but when threads work on anything shared - then there are potential problems.
        like shared class members or singleton class or classes with limited instances - then you have the problem of thread safety.
        Think of it this way - lots of threads are coming thru Our controller class. Any state information can easily be wronged.
    Rest controllers don't run 1 after the other - although controller instance is shared - all threads run it simultaneously
        so at any given time we can have n threads running thru the singleton controller.
CS - Arch - make 1 straight forward transactional DFD story and then think alternatives.
IDEA - Derivations and discussions. Also delivered in LIB so qualifies for sume.
    Create a transformation matrix for the TSS vector. Any product is also yet another transformational matrix. But convenient for the user.
        chaining of the rules is output becomes input for the other.
        This is being realized thru nested rules - rule that has rule as a function. Good idea. Called rule orchestration.on
        windowing - for sliding average - can think of implementing it in terms of sequences of previous one itself.
            but the problem of late comers. Integral as a solution. I would like to have it but how to explain to the users but gotta explain - not easy to sell.
        Transformation problem solution is quite a work.
            introduce 2 spark jobs - error recognition, outlier recog, and correction, UoM transformations.
            expensive to break everything around monitoring and data ingestion pipeline. Any idea to do it quicker.
            We lose many customers cuz we don't have these basic capabilities.
    Sequential circuits vs combinatorial circuits - when output becomes the input for the same or the other circuit.
        Sequential circuits - can realize polynomial functions of higher order.
        Not that design time team has to do it - even we can do it from inside our spark job - this can be proposed or implemented when time comes.
        @who needs it from hardware when software can do it.
CS - Refactoring
    Doesn't matter lines of code (5-15 is a helpful indicator through). method should do one thing and only one thing.
    Indicators that this is not the case -
        More than one level of indention in a method
        Paragraph Breaks - whitespaces between logical statements.
    fit on screen is very good - imagine if you have to gives reasons to a lawyer.
PIES - Foundation - It is about well being. Divided into 4 as follows
    Attitude - Internal or mental well being. Mental States - personal psyche.
        Can stretch this to include external conduct in personal space.
    Behavior - Well being with respect external conduct (personally or socially) - eg driving car, polity, etc. Social psyche (or personal well being in society)
    Communication - Well being thru Interactions or exchanges. Networking - micro-economics and fun
    Devotion - Well being thru being purpose centric. Scrum. Effectiveness or IQ Motivation.
    Conclusion - Psychology, economics and Motivation is at the heart of this.
        but also social studies for behaviors eg but that can always be studied under ashram.
EQ - Economics
    Price increase does not change demand (only demanded quantity). In economic terms, demand is a reference to how useful a good is to the customer.
    in economics, if they say “demand increases” it means people are willing to pay more for it.
    True demand has it’s root in fundamental human desire, not in economics. It’s a subjective measure of how important a good or service is to a person relative to other goods and services.
    So when we say demand increases, we are suggesting people have changed their view of what is important to them and they want more of a product than they did in the past.
    if ice were simply to become a far more popular product for people to buy, then the companies producing and selling ice might be able to produce it for less, due to economies of scale
    So in general, increased demand increases price when supply kept constant but if supply can be increased then economics of scale takes over.
    Similarly, lower demand, lower cost.
    Higher prices mean less demand. But High demand raises the prices.
    1 ice-creaming then bidding so price shoots. 100 icecream, price drops cuz you have replacements.
    Higher price (than value), you reduce the intake thus demand; lower price, then you over use it.
    So, price is just in middle and price and demand keep affecting and stabilizing each other along with supply.
    There's demand so there's price. Price rising, then demand reduces so you can't increase it too much.
    Study it as human behavior with respect to price in terms of supply and demand. The price is too low, people will desire it more.
        another study, market behavior of price, with respect to demand and supply. You know that people value this, you can rate it high.

IQ - Presentation
    Organize your content.
        Theory and Practical should intersperse - practical really spices things up.
        specification, then end user presentation, architecture, code review.
    Practice 3 times b4 your presentation.
CS - Mac hierarchy - Good UXD.
    Apple icon -> list -> icons -> tabs -> list columns hierarchy -> individual controls / Demo video.

IQ - Lessons from College Alumnus senior Abhijeet of SAP who left for Intuit
    US Finance for tax filing - books maintain - us finance - real time transactions to be streamlined - kubernetes, apache kafka,streaming real time, it's not there yet
    it could batch - schedule they do - as much as manager said - that has to be real time.
    4.5 years now so have to see new - Any time no learning it's time to switch within or outside.
    do as much in 40 years - do as much good as possible by that time.
    Stable position by 40 years - monetary value and designation - it gets dangerous with time. Like pandemic.
    stable - work and money. You are young - design item pick.
    Brain you have - design item uthao - crowd - only few people are good - Ajay is good (a lot to learn from, can offer helps), kanu is good, ok, Imran is good.
    Baaki sabki dukan chal rahi hai. Tune dukaan nahi chalani - seekh karke nikalna hai. Grow more. Learn and grow - repeat.
    Get good work - this is old and deprecated. Old home work and then pick new work.
    New tools and learning but money is less - that disturbs.
    Less money should inspiration for work. People still can give you more money for work - but you gotta see both work and money.
        not step out just like that - money more and work also good.
        Know good work then good money not vv. Basics strong and then go out - lots of money in market.
        Private company this is the advantage it's not govt company.
        No deception here - learn till you know everything - what you do - ppl or can close eyes and tell it all. I know in and out - he knows business - he should be able to say.
        Less money will give you inspiration that I need to improve and get better.
        This is beginning - pick work then learning and responsibility comes naturally - if you keep sitting, that's what you end up with.
        More work you pick, more you are pushed forward.
        Work pickers are little less - pick a bcp and take help from others.
        BCP solving then you will understand the product - Ask ajay he will help - but need to go to him with knowledge - to ask him about M, you already need to know A to L.
        Accha sa Kaam utha - design kar, interest automatically aa jayega.
        coming from good place and have learnt so much that others won't know - so implement more than others - give suggestion.
        Behind the curtain won't give anything - Come ahead and speak - it's our team only. Speak out and you know so much that here people don't 
            not so much about showcasing yourself than giving really good suggestion.
            But b4 suggestion, read something about product - if that's feasible not selling knowledge - speaking anything without even knowing the product.
            wiki documents - product exploration - sap help document gives business knowledge.
            Ingestion pipeline - scala streaming code - no rocket science - only take input source is different from output.
            so take input from device. Output is time series. Spark streaming written for that. Cache written - transforms and gives something else. That's all.
            Know some spark and kafka - write some spark streaming app - then Confidence that I know things.
            Architectural understanding - product understanding and product programming then architecture is automatic.
        State spec - spark streaming lecture - it's a hashmap. Any language to learn is see its documentation.
            if keywords then you don't get anywhere - it's simple cache. If you hold onto something then you won't get it.
            Lectures see - conference, summits gotta see - some old ones really good. Faruki's is good.
            Some small product you should make in weekends - read spark like a guy came who didn't now spark earlier - he learnt - picked data from open source.
            and did streamlining on aadhar card and stored in redis - automatically understanding comes - for your own learning.
            don't think it is company's work - company's work is project. Technology is OSS and that is another project. Office we just more.
            But learning tech is first thing and then comes product.
        You need to look up to 7 - And I am not going till that date and there are many more people to look up to. take my number. Anyways from the same college.
    Hike is good 50% and your level it will be far more - market is not bad - market is good and they pay a lot.

CS - you can install cf thru brew, cf binaries, windows installer, etc.
IDEA - Instead of DoD checking status in 10 places - let's have an app or integrate with monitoring - which checks availability across apps in scheduled manner and returns error with which all failed.
    what about failed in past - kibana logs - ideally 500 response from any app can be configured to inform on slack / email or raise IOT alarms.
    But suggesting may reduce our DoD efforts and hence manpower. 2nd, this must have already been thought before. Third, building it means not focussin on our own IOT core work.

    You think you deserve Krishna. What do you understand about Krishna - what would you know of his value.
    //Somehow last statement got blurted out loud in front of all.
    What's his value - Ask them - they say - He is worth sacrificing everything.
    1 yogi said - he was worth all the penance; who got a glimpse of him after 1000s of years of penance.
    Ask devotees [like SP] who would not mind undergoing severe pains even if it leads to failing for his cause.
    Ask devotees who laid down their lives as it was a flower to offer in face of protecting other devotees of Krishna.
    Ask devotees who have given all their time, money, effort to Krishna's cause.
    Ask those who would wait 1 million years, if that's what it takes to see him again.
    Ask those who would beg to be an insect or dog in his servant's house to serve.
    Ask the gods who beg to be a grass to be trampled upon by his devotees.
    Ask seekers who sacrifice everything in his exploration to find his traces.
    Ask servers who work for him without any demand for personal remuneration.

PIES
    YOLO pinnacle is social validation like being a celeb for something.
    It has to be across the layers otherwise it will be shallow.
    The validation is goal when we are talking YOLO life but in face of legacy, validation is a utility only.
    Stabilization in SVAF means finding a niche where you become celebrity or get huge social validations along with worldy rewards and power.
    In SVAF world, you are a leader. People are leaders like being parents, being political leaders, etc.
    PIES Engineering should already get you to personal level SVAF or achieving ego gratifications on personal front. Social recognition would be good add-on, if possible.
    This social validation comes in different grain and 3 levels (CNI - Concern Need Interest - FDDL)
        You are helpful (not awkward or disturbance) - F or C.
        You are recognized as a menber contributor (accepted as one of us) - D or N.
        You are celebrated (celeb) - This should be our target - D or I.
        //Your love for craft is visible - L as fuel.
SQ - We are really fortunate that we got Krishna's grace in all the environment since birth that takes us out of MOI and MOP infatuations - anarthas.
PIES - I am NodeJS. Asynchronous threads - keep the context so as to return to them with all details when necessary. Time saved for something more useful.
SQ - why don't I just accept people the way they are - we really don't need photocopies of people.
    We need a variety of people and we should celebrate variety and difference of opinion instead of opening.
    How can we respect people in all MMN - we accept tiger for eating meat and don't kill it for its natural behavior.
    But still that does not mean that we accept that as their right - human does not have right to kill another - human or animal
        but factually nature permits jiva to act in those ways (only rules may stop them) and then sets its tracks thru karma.
        So, for beyond life is taken care but within life, some behaviors are not desirable - so we have rule system - so that we as a community lives happily to whatever extent possible.
    But humans can control themselves - it is rather our responsibility to enlighten them and if they still continue that's their free will. Isn't it?
    We can respect MOP for their dedication even if it's for grats. Respect MOI for their humanity and empathy.
    respect MOG for paying the price for alignment. Respect trans for their visions and goals.
    1 problem in past was that people in MOG hated MOI people which are so innocent - they deserved to be helped than hated. But that hatred has a recoil. That's what at least history teaches us.
    But that's 1 showcased problem - what about MOP hating MOI - kings or leadership roles exploiting the innocent labors - all the same.
    In KC, we rise about this MMN hatred. Of course, if some MMN disturbs us, we can distance ourselves while maintaining respect - like MOP is still aligned to VA norms anyways.
SQ - Asura != MOP. Asura means exclusion of spiritual awareness - such a person can be in all MMN like MOG, MOP, MOI.
    Similarly spiritually aware person can also be in MMN until he evolves enough.
PIES - I have paid the goddamn price of MOG - people striving for enmity which you refuse. etc.
    You are manipulated into acting in a certain way - but I believe in acting in that way - don't refuse only cuz you are aware of it and refuse to accept manipulation.
    Doing dharma even if it triggers different feelings.
PIES - IF the basis of marriage is avoiding problems then it's MOI; it's its only enjoyment then MOP, etc.
    So, what should the criteria be - Godhead, Legacy and YOLO.
    Godhead perspective - I gotta get a god conscious lady or better stay focussed.
        Association is the key here - not 1 person but n people.
    Legacy perspective - Think and grow rich - either be brahmacari or find a cooperative partner (also helpful in home ishta goshti)
        Here there can be allies and frieds - life partner can be a potentially great add on.
    YOLO perspective - I need a lady who clusters with you - relate both wanna see anime or stuff.
        Being complementary with each other is a great add on. 1's weakness is solved by another's strength.
        Also, there's so much fun these days outside in consumerism that the impedance mismatch can be escaped.
SQ - Org rule - that is in question - should we question - why not. There must be reasons and leave that - no, we want to know the reasons. Why not but still the ones in management still reserve the right. And we reserve the right to question it.
    Allegation - it is fanaticism - let's first sincerely analyse if that's true - or how true does this statement is. Can that be justified. let's define fanaticism - religious niyam aagrah 
        Forgetting essence of rule you may make bad judgments - that is true.
        Problem is with religious fervor - personally that's great but imposition on others, that's beyond your right. And this is actually the different study - where religion merges with kshatriya rule.
        Problem with religion dominating the rule or the power - kshatriya - nothing wrong as long as it is shreyas. In fact, desirable.
            But imposition - that's problem beyond religion - power is all about controlling others. We can't deny that - what we dislike is controlling against their will.
            In this case, this imposition is not even against their will. But what if sb wants to see - then it's bad control - that's the precise problem here.
        Fanaticism problem precisely is what religious texts which when taken to power, controls people in ways that they dislike - which is also true with all fields but religious fanaticism is that.
            so this statement makes some sense. But it may not necessarily be religious fanaticism - it could be just fanaticism only - of some other flavor - like personal bias or political bias, etc.
            Now, temple management will have to control in larger self interest so that will sometimes involve rules which are dislike-able to some.
    Go talk to them - we are not their spokesperson. It's an org decision.
PIES - Varna - we cluster on basis of fewer characteristics so huge radial distance. But formalizations will make it easy to interact or navigate thru to interesting places.
    Ashram we cluster on more dimension but impedence mismatch is gonna be a reality anyways and proximity does expose the differences at times being informal and gives pain. But purpose centric then see beyond differences to interesting places.
    Religious or doctrine or philosophical differences is 1 thing. What about differences within religion about practices and even philosophy - how long will ppl suffer cuz of ignorance of the reality of impedance mismatch.
    Foudational differences also exist - in sheer values you believe, behavioral modes (straight vs manipulated), communication languages (in different modes), Devotion conflicts (ideologies).
    So impedance mismatch is a fact - let's see beyond differences to what we want.
    MOI avoids the impedance which is so natural and sth to empathize with but not the best move (although this line of reasoning may be unnecessary given that it's anyways not pop) but still e1 needs to answer himself as well.
        Impedance can be overcome thru proper management.
        There is fun in overcoming the impedance that shows up or does not even show up cuz of good management.
        There are rewards and power in the clustering in spite of impedance.
        Many a times we can escape conflicts thru non-confrontation and unwillingness as if boring.
            in varna, that's recommended to not touch religion and politics - and that could be true in ashram realm also many a times.
            Like saying - This is so boring - it's simple - do if you like; leave if you don't. Why conflict.
PIES - SVAF as world thinks of it - All these terms may be unpopular among people of little knowledge - they oppose certain bad stories or maybe just following along pop culture (blindly - but let's not say it) - what they really need is clarity.
    In our presentations we don't wanna fight or confront - rather reason it as if convincing ourselves - others doubts become our doubts and we gotta share how we look at it. That's all.
    What if doubt triggers a bad reaction in us. Yes, it can and that's a danger of preaching but JY means we are open (in both aaroh and avaroh ways without mix up between the 2 of them) to ideas and interpretations.
    Best attack on avaroh is proving vedas paurusheya - human origin.
EQ - World polity (yes, it's not religion) - People who blindly talk about ideal world that all religions are happy together.
    1st thing who will not want that? But this statement is so shallow from depths of reality that they don't know the heat of friction that people have endured.
    We can't wish them away - these are complicated problems with many standardizations to stabilize the situation - and now breaking those standardizations is foolish if you don't know the backdrop.
    Although the intent is good, but it suffers ignorance of reality.
    Yes, generations may forget the frictions and may cast down the walls - and if the friction points are actually gone by then, then great else they can have devastating effect again.
Logs - Story - I told her - if you think it is going fast - we can take time and then proceed instead of acting in haste. 
    I told my sister - being trained in spirituality, my concepts are very clear - that differences are bound to be there. But gotta marry anyways.
    So from my end I was accomodating and circumstances were arranged in favor of giving me exits to act in favorable ways.
    So if I did my exits aptly then whatever framework brings outside of my scope has to be accepted as karma.

PIES - Manipulations isn't restricted to MOP. All MMN may involve manipulation 
    In MOI - it is intended to escape; In MOP, it is intended for power or money or position or distinction or enjoyment; In MOG it is intended towards other's well being or alignment or 1's own.
    In Trans, it is alignment with the trans - ur own or others' - so yes manipulating them in their interest and not even scandalous in the means to a justified end but even justified means.
SQ - to realize that as sender or receiver we are just exchanging suggestions and not controlling each other.
    Social ideology is bound to be important to people. Problem is with clash - a glass which some people want to be half full, some full, some want it to contain milk, etc.

    2nd phase - when you map an issue, with what you know and have specific queries from colleagues to solve it and confirm your solution.
    3rd phase - when you only confirm with older colleagues but solve it all by yourself.
    4th phase - when you extend help to others.
IQ
    Working for company - I am a partner with company and I give favors to the company so that they can do some service that I don't concern with.
    Working in company - I am a member of concern which renders some service. I am a part of a whole which serves.
    Working with company - I am independent entity which works in collaboration with the company to render a service which is our common goal.
    The best mood I think is working with company - that gives you passion for a service and company assists you in doing that just as you assist company.
    That company is your ally - it is always about your personal value and if your partners are big that you work with 
        that increaases your value as well along with rate of increase of value with time.
CS - Before, test, asserEqual, Fake, Mock, Stub.
    Stub - an object that provides predefined answers to method calls.
    Mock - an object on which you set expectations.
    Fake - an object with limited capabilities (for the purposes of testing), e.g. a fake web service. ...
        But informally, you'll often hear people simply call them mocks.

PIES
    All SVAF - created, maintained and Deleted - with tapa and on basis of satya.
    Varna - recruitment based on satya. I am in company cuz I contribute. I will properly wind up when necessary. So with other PIES.
    Ashram satya - that I don't just show care - I show it cuz I care it and ain't fool to not show if I have it.
    1 thing that I work hard to give desirable outcomes to my partners and even the means are very pleasurable.
    I don't forget means in pursuit of goal or vv. Balance of enjoying goal and the means.
PIES - we can fight over practically everything - cuz it is all about balance - no matter what 1 says - there can be a counter argument for it for fact.
    So we don't want to keep arguing over trifles but always thru discussion find a healthy balance for ourselves.
    So every discussion should be intended to guide us in some positive direction.
PIES - Fearlessness
    Fear is for the future - that desirable should come in required amount and undesirable should not come - this is bad expectations cuz undesirable helps us just as desirable.
    Fear is felt more in MOP cuz attached to grats streaming and life feels futile without it. So MOG is the mantra.
    Fear is great power cuz it incentivises the regulated desirable behavior - at least for things that are under our control. Circle of influence => responsibility.
    For the things that are not in out control, why don't we just accept that there are things beyond our control (Circle of Concern) - called karma.
    Of course we can decide how to respond and plan around them just like exception handling.
        Clear expectations and what to do when expectations are not met - we don't paralyse bad with a runtime exception but handle them gracefully.
    Spirituality can help a great deal by 
        regulating the value of material realm
        seeing the bigger picture (higher abstractions of life)

        tattva view
        karma, mind control, value reset, etc.
    without transcendence also.
        no fear cuz the life should be worth living think freedom fighters, think army men, etc.
            Life deserves to be respected and nobody has right to undermine it.
            What is the life which only worked hard like donkey and died one day - heck didn't even enjoy the world.
        It is about the life you believe in - and paying the price of whatever comes our way to live it should be paid.
            if you fear wrong choice and resulting undesirable price 
            plz understand every decision steps from current state of being and it is the being which deserves correction not actions alone.
            So, still mistakes should be welcome.
        Problems are meant to be faced and not avoided.
            If you don't know how to deal with them - the problem is precisely this and not in mistake and that too from external (@ CS - dependencies or external services - mockito in mind)

CS
    C - Consistency means a client should get same view of data at a given point in time irrespective of node it is looked up from.
    A - Availability here means that any given request should receive a response [success/failure].
    P - Partition Tolerance means the system remains operational despite node or other hardware failures, the system is tolerant enough to these kind of failures.
    CAP - Same data view to all clients; Each client can always read and write; system works despite physical failures (network or node)
    Consistency:
    Consistency says , every read receives the most recent write or an error.
    Availability:
    Availability says, every request receives a (non-error) response – without guarantee that it contains the most recent write,
    Partition Tolerance:
    Partition Tolerance says, the system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
    Distributed systems statisfy any two terms only and not satisfy three terms.
    CP – Consistency/Partition Tolerance
    AP – Availability/Partition Tolerance
    CA – Consistency/Availability
    Eg - Cassandra - always operations but when paritioned, still available for read and write but not consistent - latest write reflected from any node - not necessary but delayed after partition reconnects.
        Read can't guarantee the best or latest but write and read always successful even when partitioned. Good for time series.
    Eg - HBase - always operational but when partitioned, still consistent - any node reading or writing will give latest timestamp but not available - if, need to write to a replica node on different partition - refusal.
        or even reading may fail if data replica on partitioned node. connection failure exception or will it keep trying. Well, it is operational but won't allow an inconsistency. So write fail but read success message.
        When partitioned, On reading you have best or latest result always. On writing, it may refuse after many retries cuz replica node may not be available or approachable.
    Eg - RDBMS - if partition happens, it will just stop working - consistent and available for all operations otherwise. No response from a node - only busy wait.
        When partitioned, it just doesn't function anymore - reading or writing request - not allowed cuz nodes not avaiable - can't write inconsistent data to n-1 replica. For reading, if replica is available then return response else exception.
    Difference between RDBMS and CP systems like Redis and HBase when partition happens.
        RDBMS stop to operate - no longer read and write possible - to some degree it could be possible if approach read and writes - every node must have metadata about other node's data - that's not true.
        Redis - will guarantee best latest read (if any approachable replica), for write if partitioned replica then fail else allow.
        the 3rd one cassandra will allow all read and writes with no guarantee of latest TS ever.
        Using Quorum, some degree of handling parition is possible that's in cassandra.
    Distributed game is play of CP or AP - either make system function with some inconsistency allowed or refuse R/W sometimes with best results always.
        Only CA is not in the game of distributed, that's centralized system.
        Strictly speaking RDBMS is just an implementation which is not made with distributed tolerance in mind.
        MySQL can be CP if configured so.
        RDBMS avoids partition not tolerates or functions despite it - it just removes unapproachable nodes so avoiding it.
    Master slave model for CA systems, Hash ring for AP systems, etc.
    Best answer - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36404765/why-isnt-rdbms-partition-tolerant-in-cap-theorem-and-why-is-it-available
    CP - master slave - if full state replica on all nodes - then Q will get A for reading.
        but write will definitely refuse cuz of partition. Partial state replica and that too not on all nodes then it's more robust.
    AP - Every Q has a A on read but for write, there will be delta getting created.
        follow master re-election or masterless like cassandra.
    CA - Every Q has A but nodes that fail are removed to cope so avoiding the partition here.
        read and writes can go on at the expense of nodes removal. That's with full replica.
        for partial replica, that's not done. Let's say country wise separation of data, then system won't work anymore if say India data unapproachable for the query.
        If full replica, network partition happens - all unapproachable nodes are removed for read and write.
    AP - always available. Keep reading and writing - just with a consistency compromise.
    CP - read from anyone but write will be restricted. More robust if partial replica.
    https://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/
        A - For Q, A is guaranteed - no response like "500 bees in my eyes"
        C - 1 state in the distributed system - no ambiguity.
            requests of the distributed shared memory to act as if they were executing on a single node
            standard database replication is not strongly consistent but special logic to handle replication lag.
        partition tolerance, the network will be allowed to lose arbitrarily many messages sent from one node to another
            monolithic Oracle server with no replication can't be partitioned.
            practically speaking - add remote clients and you are on distributed.
        reads work all the times for all CAP but writes there is a difference in stand - allow or not allow.
            assuming writing power with all the nodes - or re-election of master to write in partition else without master, no write possible anyways.

            In VA - Fun, Praises (self and external), Profits or networks (potential or employed profits), relax life.
        Devotion in life is Deep Learning neural network -
            where for 1 end result there are lots of layers to be optimised (not necessarily maximized or minimised)
            Those individual layers represented by behavior - edge represented by communication - attitude is the algorithm.
            to get the final best results of classification or whatever.
        When devoted to object of devotion, you get healthy target of devotion - healthy person, family, nation, etc.
    BC
        Behavior - in all the interactions we should act in ways that facilitate our objects of devotion.
            huge self help books, tips and tricks on multi-media.
            Whole body of social conduct (it's still foundational and personal in FBD - Free body diagram).
            Based on principles in psychology and economics - polity, persuasion, initiatives all come in this.
            Study of Human behavior - what works and what won't work, etc.
        Communications necessary within the behaviors for devotion - in both VA.
            Purpose driven (Need and concern based) - or formal. May also have interest element in favor of mutual success plan
                having protocols for success plan.
                gotta give justice to economics.
                From experience or MBA or scriptures.
            Liking driven (love and fun) - informal
                personal long term goal (love for field) - eg V some field or role so I like listening about it.
                social mutual win goal (fun for short term or long term alliance) - mutual interest in fields => so love talks
            How? Tier arch
                Presentation Layer - Spice up the presentation.
                    Elicit emotions thru 12 rasas study.
                    Language mastery.
                Content (Application Layer) - Stories and principles
                    Narratives - past stories, update stories or news, future plans.
                    Principles - revisit the journey, discover, principles brain-storm.
                    Trigger - I have done lots of homework in this b4 - let's revisit that sometime.
                Persistence - what stays with us or impressions or take away or take home message.
    A - Attitude - this is the qualities or values or beliefs we hold sacred so traversal path that we adopt.
        This is not tips and tricks but inner drivers.
        This is whole body of personal conduct - scriptural guides and traditional ideas like think and grow rich, etc.
PIES - Effective SRM - how to best spend money?
    Concern - All the transactions I must do - food, lodging, clothing.
    Need - All SRM that is necessary for CRM.
    Interest - Grats at all the layers.
        Senses - Mall products.
        Mind - Multimedia, stories.
        Intel - Consuming world services to achieve. Ideas worth sharing.
        Ego - Shopping for status symbol - what quality you buy.
        Spiritual - ?
PIES - Many people blindly think that greedy approach algo to happiness is the best algorithm but it's not - intelligence to enjoy as per BG.
    Others could be induction, DnC, Backtracking, approximation, etc.
EQ - Deep Learning - it's also about algorithm chosen, data introduced but also values and beliefs held sacred.
    Every country or region or cluster in general is through its all the efforts and protocols and turmoils, get what it originally decides to stand for.
    So, devotion and attitudes (what we want and what we are; behavior - what we do) - is what identifies a culture.
    Think about it, some country chooses freedom as god beliefs. Some cultures choose secularism. Some choose love, etc.
    In God value, some may choose prosperity, some may choose comfort, some may choose power, etc.
IQ - L1 functional problem solving is roll up of the L2 details - you gotta know as its abstract that what all functionalities, RaaS, etc are in place for the promise to be met.
    Similarly L2 is abstract of L3 - configs, I/O between blocks of arch.
    L0 or business is abstract of L1 or functionalities - You have solved a customer problem.
    What has given rise to all the comforts of current times?
        it's entrepreneurship or businesses who wanna profit themselves by making lives easier for others.
SQ - Same Deep Learning applies to our spiritual life as well.
    In beginning we under-fit or over-fit our lives with badly trained model on how spiritual life is to be practiced.
    As we encounter stimuli where our model (not spiritual life) performs badly we realize that we need to adjust.
    VA gets importance and foundation also so as to have a model which factually optimizes our spirituality for long run and fast run in that.
FND - Foundation Domain includes ed morning spending time on hobby, Exercise, Yoga, Spirituality, Book reading, personal development.
Logs - Story - Papaji tension and CSF leakage from head collision - mirgi - teeth crushed the finger. Hospital - honest doctor no treatment you better take him to PGI. Homeopathy cured him.
CS - Annotations in JAVA - https://www.baeldung.com/java-custom-annotation
PIES - Attractive Checkpoints - what they stand for in general - how do you serialize the achievements to get to a checkpoint.
    SVAF - all the following:
    F - Attractive checkpoint of healthy body (metabolism and anatomy), healthy physiology, heathy psyche.
        Oj, Fragrant, sharing meals, great touch, tej. Best Body metrics. Puzzle solver.
    A - Experiences (backlogs) cultivation in love centred co-enjoyments and re-live them thru stories and abstracts.
    V - Team Player who contributes a lots of backlogs (ideas and impl)
    S - Godhead is state attained at love of God but other checkposts are also attractive - nishtha, anartha nivritti.
FND - NFP - only Scarf, ribbon, bald and bold.
PIES - Stagification of our goals give us a checkpoint to look up to and persevere for.
    SQ - Stagify attractive checkposts.
        About - Bhajan kriya although the result of powerful SS, is also a fuel (other extensions) thru all these stages.
        Godhead - or Love of God - Different internal checkposts like ruchi, asakti, bhav, etc.
            God emotion (ultimate) experienced with God - foreshadowed by many checkpoints.
        Nishtha - unshakable - powerful reasoning ability and realization that transcends even reasoning.
            unshakable by arguments; by twisted (targetted or cultural) manipulations; by best of stimuli; etc.
        Regulated Life - Do and Don't - Anartha Nivritti and BK
            Unmanifest - 4 things roasted.
                KR - Karmic reactions - conceptual attraction but also characterised by a general happy state.
                Karma - No self fear of action. Self trust and confidence. 4 regs => Gentleman.
                Kutam - potential dangerous sanskars but not vrittis; and parallel roasting of sanskars and vrittis as well - little attention avoids sanskars inputs also.
                    no proclivities or pulls - no more agitated states. no unsettlements of missing out of sth.
                Beejam - Deep Taste in KC so no dependence on external tastes (they may or may not still be allowed exist as flavors but no dependence)
            Manifest - worldly cultivated addictions overcome. Light weight life and power to redirect in worthy goals.
            BK - Deep Meditation Sessions. BK itself is attractive.
        Sadhu Sang - Wonderful lovely people to be around.
    EQ - Stagify attractions.
        Godhead - Great co-enjoyments abstractions.
        Nishtha - Excellent Plans and executions. PPF - Past Present Future.
        SS and AN, BK - Fun interactions and value adds. Fun sessions with you.
    IQ - Stagify attractions.
        Godhead - CS Life - products with great user experiences and customer satisfaction.
        Nishtha - Architecture - great discussions with best organized products and features.
        SS and AN - Smart people around. Productive interactions (no silly mistakes). Best deliverables.
    PQ - Health Stagify Attractions.
        Godhead - Awesome health.
        Nishtha - Great workouts.
        SS and AN - Suggestions and No health lapse.
PIES - if you get insecure with 7 performing great in any of SVAF, that should be an object of adoration and inspiration 
    if that unsettles you then that exposes the gap of your vision and current state resulting in jealosy.
    If it's inspiration then you acknowledge their contribution in the culture you believe in and you are inspired in that spirit.
CS - could not resolve dependencies - Failure to find org.scala-lang:scala-library:jar:2.11 in
    The dependency direct or transitive assumes the scala runtime environment - either added thru scala extension in intellij or plugin?
    Solution add the dependency with provided in compile time - at runtime - the scala which runs will have all the paths asked for.
    The jar could not be downloaded as 2.11 - it can be downloaded as 2.11.6 however but this is not the version that many dependencies as for.
    They ask for 2.11 only - which is not even available - At runtime, those packages will internally ask for a class on the classpath - since scala is the runtime it will be provided.
Logs - Story - It was day 69 of the streak and it was difficult after kesar and NF - brainstormed the goals of PIES, still not enough. Temple of iron for stability for some time. Then a long walk - 7.25 Km. Solved.
EQ - FIN
    Asking for platform charges which gives not much value add (I can take value add thru the drop downs) except information
    so there's opportunity here - what needs to be done. withdraw and share proft and don't pay without profit.
    Share holding or Mutual Funds - We expect the country economy to grow at a certain rate
    Annualized profit is no value add - net profit is something - withdraw early investments as per interest scale and reinvest in a short while it get regularized.
        If it is lower than anticipated but promise to make up - then only principal recovery.
        If lower and no promise, then withdraw totally and put in FD. If negative, then patience and time to buy.
IQGrats - IDEA - Outlook add on or plugin to handle individual mails - perform some ML or NLP to classify the mail to 1 of the boxes.
    Also huge crowd of emails - there is a possibility of doing group by over the mails for an hour and then send a grouped mail.
    non-repudiation - it won't allow us to modify emails but we should have handles for permanent deletion and persisting some information until we send an aggregated mail or write it on some pane.
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/tutorials/outlook-tutorial#implement-a-first-run-experience
CS - Maven shade plugin is more powerful than assembly plugin cuz it permits renaming, filtering, etc.
SQ - I need some shelter but won't call upon him like a fool - he is a dependable shelter - not a shopkeeper type but a parent or guide type.
PIES - Adhyatma makes a great combination with Varna and ashram constantly exposing the lack of our alignment with spiritual platform.
    Like lack of spiritual qualities - exposing our MMN attachments, inducing agitations thru falling short on expectation or fear thereof.
    The ideal answers that you can give for how to handle a situation ultimately is what is expected from constitutional nature of soul, who is currently under conditioned atmosphere.
    That soul is unable to act as expected is an exposed shortcoming 
    although these qualities on psyche come naturally with spiritual advancement - and start to stabilize as good sanskars and vrittis, these should also be cultivated on our psyche (mind, intel, ego).
        this effort is sign of sincerity, 
        attracts Lord's attention, 
        gives a favorable culture for spirituality to in turn develop them, 
        is a sadhana itself - VA is good for SQ although maybe not the best answer. Eg - M Janak perfected thru this alone.
            Practically this is an assistance with other sadhana and not independent or alone or mutex.
            For that matter our BK sadhana is also performed at psyche level only to attract mercy.
    Godhead is defined not by comforts or ideal realm - it is that but most importanly, the state of being in love with most lovable person.
        It is really difficult - it's about full alignment and being in love - where it's not not about me anymore, it's all about you. Even beyond, it's all about us.
        It's a pipeline of perfection so although it seems far off, there will be many good examples - not pop in kali but eg will still be there 
            at least of those in past generations that stood out - many more that don't get their names registered. Mahajano yena gatah sa pantha.
        Typically it's difficult - from 1st introduction thru extended arm of Krishna (devotees), it takes 3 lifetimes - but that's not the package SP has given.
            it's possible we are already in our 2nd or 4th lifetime - both quality and quantity matters besides mercy.
            SP's standard is strict sadhana and services in surrender - a lifetime of surrender - that lives only for pleasing the object of love.
        There are many attractive checkposts like AN - manifest (true for habits breaking 4 regs - exact or approx) and unmanifest - that show up on stimuli or sustained stimuli.
            AN is crossed when share holding of KC has exceeded AN and any stimuli even if attractive is faded in face of KC and its culture.
            Nishtha where we are firm and see it for fact - this stage is ideal for preaching.
PIES - We are destined to become what we decide to be. Worst is no decision.
    My Ego - Godhead (ultimate god love), CS Life / Singham Winnow, CustomerOfGod/ SocialServer, Breathe Science.
    These are my decisions in SVAF. So, if that's true, I have made my choice.
    Proof of being there - when others start to say that about you. What's need of doing anything else - only these goals matter. Decision means - nothing but that.
        REL - You give a seminar and others explicitly address you as CS. You write papers and implicitly you are accepted as CS Guy. Your contributions on YT and people say wow the cs guy.
            also that well, you are a winner or singham (that's poetic that this was given to me from dev director and how my parents address me).
        REL - when others say that You are customer of god - you have experience world a lot. Or you are a social server - your contributions thru newspaper articles make a difference.
        REL - when others start to say that you are worthy of godhead or that you are in love for God - no damn pretension.
        Now, no1 will say that out of blue, it means that 
            wherever we are obligated, we get appreciated for doing best justice to our work like many comedians in their show. Being client makes me an edge server 
                REL like comedy of good level - not professional but awesome quality.
            And taking initiatives, like for CS Life, giving a seminar OR others have so much trust on you that they come and propose you give a seminar.
    What about escaping it all sometime - yes, regulate that as well or make most out of it - in terms of standardization. That's again customer of god for you. So, reduce eth to that.
FND - NFP - 7 in compromised situation, should that invoke compassion to help or is that an opportunity to take advantage of. What mental and social culture is this creating - is this what we believe in?
CS - Maven - Shade Config
    execution phase, goal.
    Alt
        createDependencyReducedPom - removes transitive dependencies which are already in your shaded jar. This prevents consumers from pulling them in twice.
            Makes it behave like normal pom with no automatic transitive dependencies in the jar corresponding to the pom.
        relocation or rename
        filters - filter - artifacts patterns to include; patterns to exclude.
    Solving approach - Big bang and DnC vs induction or Backtracking the problem.
CS - Maven - Compile means include the pom for transitive jars so that during the deployment build we will get it all on classpath. Provided means no need to include pom for download to get its jar.
    jars from here eventually open in the lib folder.
    shade or assembly means includes classes of the transitive jars.
    Think of pom dependency as asking for a branch of jar and not a leaf jar.
IQ - When anything does not work - it is either bad orchestration from our end or some promise not being met from a tool.
    If tool we have to reduce or debug the tool to basics and figure where we went wrong in the configuration - if it was not our wrong configuration - then raise a bug and start finding a workaround in the meantime.
    quick help websites are a great help.
    and all the while we have to stay cool - cuz it is all about aligning with the tools and helping others in the process. if you can't then wth - take some time out to ultimately help or raise bug for helping your peers who wanna help.
PIES - Realization that materialists are amazing in their serving a certain layer of deep neural network - only that we have additional layer which uses the layer that they may be good at so take their help.
    Work or ashram is nothing but a dhyan session - meditation should not play around with your emotions. Emotions should be invested but not be playable by that. Meditation means fully aligned and absorbed into the object.
    There can be context switching involved and that's ok - that's a set of meditations based on 1 topic.
IQGrats - Cracked - No Sync between dependencies resolved and external dependencies with classes shown by intellij IDE - invalidate cache and restart the IDE solved the problem.
IQGrats - Cracked - Scala lang uses transitive dependency with version specified in the property of your project pom - scala.version should be 2.11.8 and that will be used to download relevant version in transitive dependency.
    I used 2.11 and hence it was trying to search the artifact with version that didn't even exist - they key was using the property.
PIES - The plan is increase attraction towards sadhana and checkpoints.
    Always set the platform which stretches as if we are forced to say I am not ready for this and then make that work.
    REL - I may be on manifest AN stage but push yourself to Nishtha platform - here, it is expected that you will encounter some agitations and challenges 
        face them and learn to navigate thru them until that platform becomes natural.
    For AN, maintain a lapse log or agitation log. It should act as need for jnana and dhyana reminders 
        where head on limitation is and keep reminding yourself of tattva, divine qualities I must get.
        also incentivized top down approach of cultivating strong KC to be able to handle that.
Logs - Agitations
    Bad logistics - public using an area for garbage disposal.
    Garbage songs on weekends
    Getting angry over value judgments on some temple managements.
    Can't take shit of a tool not working - although it is just a proof of lack of alignment. Maven shade plugin not working as promised causing a big bang failure.
    Fear of anticipated pressures - being forced to act right - seeing opportunity as restriction on freedom. 
        Relatives gonna come and work is stuck somewhere and I must deliver the best personal expectation - fear of falling short. So escapsim with manifest AN.
Movie - Pirates of Caribbean.
Movie - Star Wars.
Movie - Kungfu Panda movies.
Movie - Kick.
Movie - Chhalang, Badhai Ho, Dream Girl, Good News.
Movie - Punjabi - 2 of them.
EQ - 1 arch achievement is ability to have RDBMS of movies, anime, etc to suggest to someone. Ability to quote eg from there 
    CRM means networking - especially guests but also other inmates - HCM is pure enjoyment. There is also a merger of HomeErp.
    EQ Arch is seeing the merging of different HomeErp and also taking Edge Server stands for different fields like comedy, poetry, magic, philosopher, etc.
PIES - Anartha Nivritti Phase is about not just tolerating pleasures but also pains.
    Not just tolerating but also solving and evolving
    Scope - Pain (3-fold miseries and BODD) and Pleasures (6+1 anarthas) over future promises, past sanskars giving a push and present persisting ones
        causing illusion or rebellion while taking fake or dangerous or sub-optimal shelters
    C - tolerating how - by taking shelter of something.
        material shelters as advised are good for stabilizing the situation but not ultimate.
        Fake and dangerous shelters should be avoided - like 4 regs breaking or escaping the problems or ignoring the pleasures inducing illusion
        Those not on transcendence inevitably depend on worldly shelters - VA and distributed souces for stability - n pillars of dependence instead of 1, etc.
        Some take only spiritual shelter - this is a high road which is master stroke but demands more price - so desirable but not easy - better club it with apt material shelters.
    C - Letting Go - Escaping is evading the problem but sometimes it helps.
        At least to gain mental equilibrium to face the problem or sometimes, helps us change the track (alternative) to avoid the problem.
        This path is also acceptance of fact that sometimes situations are just beyond us and we should let time heal it.
    I - Evolving how - By making the experience count - with advantages for future SVAF.
    N - Solving how - foundational changes or manipulations to make situation favorable for KC again 
        working on your attitude, worldly behaviors, communicating things well and devotion - focusing on what's worthy of devotion and readjusting paths or tracks of devotion.
SQ - Preaching or Nishtha at premature stage comes with many dangers 
    imagine n people dumping their problems and doubts in you
    it is like making their doubts and challenges your own.
    If you don't have good standing you can get shaken. Or can't continue.
    people look up to not just words but also actions, and estimate thoughts thru bodily gestures 
        it is huge responsibility and hence pressure of alignment (a great help but also loss of freedom if you ain't there yet)
        setting bad eg or you diluting standards or changing fundamentals to suit your need for freedom - discourages sincere practitioners and spawns an apasampradaya, etc.
    SP recommends preach as much as you know so preaching with humility - that we don't know it all but I can help as much as possible for us.
IQGrats - Lapse - Minimize jar along with specifying all artifacts with few excludes solved the class not available for spark uber jar problem.
    Then hana driver not found cuz no reference except JDBC so wrote exclusive include for the driver in shade plugin.
    Google: maven shade plugin minimizejar
    2 jars => 2 folders - 1 work and another didn't for spark submit and du -hs * | sort for comparing 2 contents on excel along with VLOOKUP.
        found lots of extra undesirable content for 1 so minimizeJar.
FND - Devotion - every scrum update is talking about your IQGrats - so it's a fun journey giving scrum updates.
CS - Maven - To remove local repo - simple go to m2 directory and delete the contents or another, mvn dependency:purge-local-repository -DreResolve=false
CS - JAVA - Annotations is a very important concept. Frameworks or libraries use reflection classes to read the classes, methods fields with annotations and apply logics accordingly.
    https://www.baeldung.com/java-custom-annotation
CS - Maven and IntelliJ not importing maven - indexing problem.
    -Xmx10068m in the Intellij preferences - maven importing vm - -Xmx10068m
causes - traffic separation, disable coldstore, unexplored consts.
    is record ever deleted? if yes, when.
    is record ever updated that causes the selection fail.
    Never deleted - except update from performance so ain't never happening.
    Checked the kibana logs we maintain the ceiling of 1 week logs only then we throw or archive them.
    This means that they could be lost for us now.
    Since Code store type was assigned so we already know the cause of ExecutionException.
    Now, the problem is exactly what she is asking - why was the entry not made, buds.
    Since logs must be gone for onboarding also - exact reason could be difficult but a theory can surely be made.
Polity - Stereotype actions to personality and see a person rebel or change behavior.
    Complain and person tries to change. Appreciation.
    Firm stand of how you want yourself to be taken - even st vocal about it.
    Typecasting - 1-2 encounters used as justification to define a person.
        solution - counter eg.
    Narrative forming - few incidents and giving it a story of your choice.
    Other sources of power exercised -
    Brute power - physical or vocal or resourceful.
        numbers on your side.
    Willingness or not on your side. Talking win-win.
    Information manipulation - hiding, showcasing, lying as per comfort.
    Logic on your side; reminding logic.
    Power from position - cuz you are the role so what you say is true.
        Power of alliance - buying body guards, etc.
    Power from purity or ethics or morality - Let's do this cuz it's right.
    Some disruption from normal is always expected - we don't want civil war among guards and citizens.
        Some citizens are bound to think that they deserve to cross the fence a little and thru insisting - they settle with just a little beyond.
        We feel upset cuz we like people to pay the price for anything - and well, even if we don't like it - this behavior manipulation is a deserving act - maybe not enough but still deserves some art.
    Take a stand - others are bound to change it to clarify - like saying no it's not ghee - let me taste again.
        package is 15 right. Ok, just tell more or less.
    Reinforcement learning - sell away the chair if Rajasthan king didn't show up.
    set boundaries so that only alternative of your choice is left for the person to do.
    Your behavior of approval or disapprovals - showing a person potential friend or enemy based on how you behave.
EQ - Indian plight - it's not that bad first of all - 2ndly - god emotions or driver. Next, conflicting forces - cancelling vectors. Individual level - lack of discipline or alignment to disciplines - arts not supporting science - making fun of.
    Glorifying those who can get a workaround - of course that's a talent but also lack of ability to do wonders with alignment. But many a times, practicality is the answer; teaching is difficult to align with - being theoretical.
    I am not saying that there are no valid reasons. There could be. But why some are god performers and some are not.
    There are really good performers in India as well - these are those align. There is no shortage of list.
Movie - Super 30.
Logs - Story - Mama papa mediators neighbor jatts in the rowhouse.
    Dog no bark and no bite just standing in face of 10 attack modes dogs and no messing around. Even his master - what a spirit.
    Home Lakshmi Mama - Business went down with globalization and loan load - removed, partners who wanted to withdraw paid back.
    Bauji's father had landholding - which divided among the children
    Chachaji very assertive about his room swapped with vheli house - which they didn't like.
    Papa spent a lot on chachaji room and willingly handed all the rooms to elder brother as well. That's love.
    Jass got lots of money by taking some lands on his name and 50% of factory land but with some profits, conflict of water bambi came.
SQ - I remember a devotee joking but so true - We just maintain newcomers with meeting seniors the real magic happens.
    so if good practice we could have started nishtha stage but those who are deeper levels they reinforce our KC better.
FND - NFP - Trend (universal but especially here)
    Situations become favorable for a vritti - probability of relevant action given a set of conditions or environment or a setting or context.
        very strong cuz there are impressions and tendencies all looking for a slight trigger
    Soul really thinks there is a satisfaction in the excitement (vs higher layers - so you are discontent here)
    Conviction at ego - Nistha - Soul may have theoretical beliefs but internal conviction that sth does make you happy.
        there are n competing convictions - SVAF based for fulfilling a discontent or free time grat.
    This fight drills down to intelligence supporting one of n competing convictions with supply of reasons.
    As per winning side, to get a feeling, some line of willing and subsequent thinking is triggered.
    The law of engulf or consumption takes over.
FND - NFP - Fem are far more than just externals. Beautiful minds, intellects, and what not - how dehumanizing it is to reduce them to externals.
    What do we support them to become. We sponsor their degradation; incentivize them.
    It degrades us. The experience that they must go thru cuz of demand also degrades them and hence the culture cuz of broadcast.
    Their fears of their families not looking at their work.
Movie - Fukrey.
EQ - In Grihastha Ashram, should we marry? Marriage - with another person - will it help?
    Godhead - Nope. It's personal endeavor - only favorable else problem. So, like a clutch.
    Legacy - Preaching or teaching creates better legacy. But gene pool lost if you don't. You gonna compete with pop and multimedia and other influences.
    World Grats -
        in SVAF, except ashram it's just should be favorable else it's a potential problem - that's the only abstraction that matter - no direct involvement.
        for ashram, all ERP are bound to increase and grow in flavors - SRM, SCM production, CRM Networking, etc; even HCM entertainment will grow but since total time is same - new genres will be explored like with friends.
            New shoppings that you earlier didn't but new resource that means which otherwise you would not have bought.
            FIN will increase cuz 2 sources.
        FDDL - Is this all increased grats?
            Lack of fear cuz at least 1 more person as shelter or security. More desire fulfillment - yes at different layers.
            Love in material world so something noteworthy there. Duty of legacy already covered.
        So, verdict is addition of new flavors which if are welcome-worthy then great. More security or shelter. Experience of Krishna's substitute love.
            although in theory no one can replace Krishna but still at our stage we can't approach Krishna.
Logs - Story - how powerful your other ERP become with good SRM. Like teaching courses online for child or Healthify Me - Surabhi Didi does this wonderfully.
    Even Syami orders whatever must be ordered.
IQGrats - Lapse - Searching by exception log in current project the exception could be happening from a dependency of the project - that won't show in the find.
CS - Inner class is like having an assistant. Outer class in the same file - no obvious view to programmer but available just in case. Separate file then - in view of programmer.
IQ - PIES also.
    I do Varna for happiness DFD L0 - next, I achieve it thru FDDL - Stability, Money, Contributions and Fun. Same applies to SVAF.
    Think of day work as canvas to drag and drop your standardized stuffs to. So, easy stuff there. Implementation is nothing.
    As far as best drag and drop pattern that's also Design pattern thingy - mastered - more time goes in that fun thinking and discussion
        than implementation - that's easy - to be done in an hour.
    In 20s work hard in various fields but 30s work - decide your niche and delegate or standardize for easy life so that you can focus on other things.
    30s is better for business than tech - of course, can be done before also but 30s also brings in maturity.
CS - Redis connection
    var full_df = sparkSession.read.format("csv")
      .option("sep", "\t")
      .option("inferSchema", true)
      .option("header", true)
      .load("/Users/I341365/Desktop/Lets/spring-boot-multi-module/service/src/main/resources/pantheon.tsv")
    full_df.write.format("org.apache.spark.sql.redis").option("table", "people").option("key.column", "en_curid").save()
    println("Done!!")
    var df = sparkSession.read.format("org.apache.spark.sql.redis").option("table", "people").option("key.column", "en_curid").load()
    df.show(2)
    println("Hope you like it, bro!!")
    //sparkSession.read.format("org.apache.spark.sql.redis").option("table", "people").option("key.column", "en_curid").load()
    //runJob(sparkSession, null, null);
    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[*]").setAppName("DataIngestion")
    sparkConf.set("spark.streaming.stopGracefullyOnShutdown", "true")
    sparkConf.set("spark.default.parallelism", "2")
    sparkConf.set("spark.driver.host", "localhost")
    val sc = new SparkContext(sparkConf)
    //runJob(sc, ) - no worries cuz submit program is gonna call this class - and it will call runJob.
    sc.stop()

Logs - Lots of lessons for foundations behavior and even others.
    Syami praised for his funny mood unlike others being serious. Let's enjoy seriousness. Yes we gotta make most of what's there.
        This is still a good choice to by default be doer or solver for a project and st spice it up for fun 
        while this is true - it is always possible to seek more fun in every given situation with practice.
        So, we gotta associate with right people for subconscious training and for conscious just deliberate a little over what amuses you.
    Agitated by manhandling phone snatched - spoke my ATM pin loudly which I generally don't do.
    People are artificial - yes eth is beyond binary but you gotta take 1 stand at a time with confidence. So, never negate your statement especially immediately.
    Head Doctor at Ranjeet Avenue - to be pursuaded in your interest
        People can be talked into agreement - pleading to consider your case, we are willing to pay more; our plight we have already travelled thru so many hospital and we came here with great hope.
    She tells alternatives - tell why approaching you was the best bet; start telling your story which makes your case stronger - after investing into your story probability of yes grows.
    Hospital visit and wait at reception
        Ew we gotta put pressure on people for them to behave at their best in terms of time, their duties or efforts - how much time will it take; follow ups - Sir our job is very small; start explaining your case.
    Check with hotel to guide you regarding airport behavior on covid proofs. And they did offer useful insight of soft copy - gmail from testers or hospital or photo to be sent, etc. Id generated national check online.
    Agitating situation becomes more agitating when people are not united and are busy proving that they are better than others or 7 is shit.
    Papa is best at tolerating things over impedance mismatch - we gotta do our duties and even when there isn't proper reciprocation we gotta still do the duty and not backout. Papa is exemplary in some ways at tolerating undesirable situations.
    Compassion for the car driver lady who could not maneuver her car while parking - no issues I parked it where possible for me.
    Adhrit - introduce as many nouns and verbs as possible - amuse yourself if you were his age with all the help from quora and so - how will you enjoy and learn more at his age.
        becoming like a dog trying to bite his fingers and failing in the attempt.
PIES - There are more fallbacks after ashram, there's personal amusement be in varna or ashram based but personal - personal improvement (health included) also but that's more on the side of spiritual.
Uncat - Adhrit - Studying thru movies - synthesis.
    Nathdvara details. Doctor arranged for Adhrit Story. Udaipur Stories. Kumbhalgarh stories.
    Polity - Boarding pass - speak it out at least and give reasons for what you want and accept whatever.
    The way or tone that you speak also has an impact on a person - he got fever in different tones.
    I spend so much TME - that's not for nothing - these have to add up.

SQ - Engg means task level CRUD; Arch means project level CRUD. Scie is knowledge level CRUD.
    Applies to ashram also - task like cook sth or wearables. Project like rearranging the house, etc.
Movie - KGF
    Application - history doesn't change in a day but needs attention on how it's working and gradually bringing change.
SQ - harness dualities
    We work hard and we achieve things - tapa to phala is design of material world and should be respected.
    It's also the design of material world that with fire, there is bound to be smoke and vv - we should try to minimize it AMAP.
    If you learn to perform KC in worldly dualities then extremes also can assist you not otherwise.
    eg - heavens or hell are not best suited for consciousness evolution - go transcendence (bahirmukh) or Imminence (antarmukh)
SQ - Stages of consciousness evolution and checkpointing.
    KY - sakaam to nishkaam stages.
        Checkpointing over growth along tiers as an eg.
        common people enter upon VA with MMN mindsets and not evolution mindset
        that's the benefit of knowing the full picture - to have MOG.
        Perfection - work for Krishna.
    JY - shravanam to sakshatkar stages at different tiers grains and dimensions.
        Understanding - Shravanm is adopting model, schema, SAP, etc.
            mananam is deliberation as per experiences to approve, decline or perhaps buckets placement.
            nidhidhyasanam is to make it practical - act on your model.
            sakshatkar is to see it happen without counter eg and increased probability of its correctness.
        Checkpointing for both bahirmukh and antarmukh mensurated thru tiers only.
        for both aaroh and avaroh - grow from tech, engr, arch, scientist - basically grow in the granularity of the tiers ability to serve.
        even proof of antarmukhi evolution is ability serve at which granularity - task level, project level or guide level.
        Perfection - every stimulus connects to Krishna (not at faith level but realized level)
            maya is to not see that connection.
            Eg - Shampoo - Krishna's prakriti energy's 1 resource helps maintain another resource for me to best serve him.
                material interactions and MMN interactions towards highest self interest.
    DY - yama to samadhi.
        checkpointing - great attention towards tiers line of effort.
        Perfection - fixed attention on the Lord.
    BY - shraddha to prema.
        checkpointing from world to trans gradually.
        Also checkpointing from personal perspective - reducing interest in worldly identifications and more with trans identifications.
        Importance - This BY or ego level transformation has highest bearing on others.
        Perfection - Identity in connection to Krishna. "BelongsTo" Relationship.
    More - we can't afford to have yet another life. We must perfect in this very life.
        No more bodily (gross or subtle) prisons.
        SP has given us 1 life perfection model and that's our path.
SQ - stages of life for SVAF. 4 nested loops.
    B - Tiers - Personal, Group, Social, Spiritual.
        Until the end result to become one with the respective tiers.
    J - Growth - Within all of them - Tech, Engg, Arch, Sci.
    D - For Practical - grow from Dharana to Samadhi.
    K - Grow from MOI thru MOP to MOG for next tier.
CS - Spark - Batches never run together.
    as long as ingestion is slow the batch interval does not matter.
    spark will consume in a bigger bunch (assuming max.records is set aptly)
    on shutdown - there is a hook and all remainder batches will be finished b4 stop.
        checkpoint directory will maintain data if you force stop - restart will pick up.
        Delete the files if too much.
    if spark consumption max records per batch is barred then too big batch duration will make it slow.
    if batch duration is made much slower than processing - it will survive for some time and then memory issues will start showing.
    if ingestion rate is increased further, then higher batch duration can cause problem being bottlenecked by the max records else no problem.
    so best is to play somewhat (or even considerably) more than the average processing time until you know that max records per batch won't be a choke.
    Streaming tab starts after the streaming is started as awaitTermination and batches are processed.
IQGrats - Being validated by the senior colleague over the analysis of why a dedicated spark job was failed for the tenant.
    did it all end to end with only access to DB and code repo. Reference for local run.
    Build it - use local run configs with many shortcomings and correct them along the way.
    Make code changes to bypass the ssl needs, hana tunnel creation, bypassing the library thru direct call.
    Fetching the records from hana for a sample dataset creation.
    Code changes to override in order to escape what's outside of control but eventually finding its root cause.
PIES - Serious fun. Serious word makes it boring. And Only fun makes it foolish.
    Show the limitations of the other extreme and then start telling your ideal world.
    Eg - Then why work, go on dancing like jackass. There is fun in everything including books.
    I like to believe that beating someone in the name of fun isn't cool.
        The seriousness or sacredness of life has to be maintained.
    That's boring - what's the use of being "not boring", if I can't have a serious heart to heart talk with you.
    Fun is usually in the moment and it can be across layer of existence. Mostly preyas but has advantages of mindfulness.
        Seriousness is usually shreyas in the long run thinking and not being dissuaded by short term rewards.
        We need a life which has both short term entertainment without compromising our long term interests.
        We drive the car for a destination but enjoy the journey. Enjoying journey is fun but reaching destination is seriousness.
        Simplest answer to that claim is what's the use of sitting in 1st class apartment if the train does not reach destination.
        This statement captures the balance between shreyas and preyas aptly.
        Some believe reach destination even if stay miserable thru journey - that's not good.
        Some believe that enjoy the journey even if you reach a place that you didn't want - that's not good either.
        The balance wins.
IQ - Good quality of Ashok that he is always open to good ideas coming from anywhere to improve things.   
PIES - Most important
    About
        The real problem is that our goals are not high enough. We get whatever little goals we set.
        As a man thinketh, so learn to think high.
        We have to target goals that are in our reach or Circle of influence.
        We know that Spiritual world is highest prayojan (actually helping others in their perfection is still higher)
        This is COC and getting it is beyond our COI
        what's in our hand is tapasya for the same but we also wanna checkpoint our progress.
        So there are stages of perfection as per 4 high level ashrams that we should strive for
        this is mainly from avaroh pantha but relatable in aaroh pantha
            we will use all the guidance in avaroh and aaroh for the following goals.
            avaroh on other levels of perfection is application of same at smaller granularity tiers
            it's important to not get stuck at any particular but traverse thru it for perfection.
            aaroh can come from self help authors, experiences, successful idolizing, science, logical thinking, exploring social systems, etc.
    Prayojan - In terms of SVAF, the following - 
        I want personal perfection
            Eg - spirituality and Foundation in attitude - being virtuous in qualities, etc.
            being highly effective
            in Varna I can do it all, In ashram, I consume everything.
            Abstract Idols - always making yourself better, people with regulated lifestyle.
        I want group (team/family) perfection
            Eg - spirituality and foundation in behavior - behavioral qualities and examplification.
            being great contributor
            in Varna we can do it all, In ashram, we consume it all.
            concerned with great coordinations in interest of some social goodness (but not specific best social interest)
                there are also impedance or resistance but those specific problems are just jnana and dhyan based problem solving.
            Abstract Idols - all awesome people around you (focus on positives of e1 around you)
        I want social perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in communication - being a spiritual or principles expert (or idol) and guiding so.
            dedicated to social welfare
            in varna, all of us do it all; In ashram, all of us consume it well as a culture.
            Abstract Idols - All great men of the past - the people who left legacy by the purpose which was bigger than themselves.
        I want universal perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in Devotion - becoming one with spirituality and principles.
            this is mystic and esoteric side of perfection
            In Varna - we align well to trans in work; In ashram - we align well to trans in enjoyment.
            Abstract Idols - acaryas, sages, God and avatars.
    Abhidhyeya
        About - There are initial loads for all of them called BY, JY, DY, KY.
            all of the following are meant to be invested in 4 tier interests
            with special focus on 1 as per your stage.
        B - becoming 7 thru association.
            initial load - BY - become like sages, become like Krishna (thru stages)
            anartha nivritti phase is to emphasize avoid those what I don't wanna be like
                or distractions from what I wanna be like.
            aaroh - visualizations, affirmations, etc.
        J - knowledge cultivation from aaroh and avaroh sources with plan of application.
            initial load - knowledge cultivation, even repetition, spending time to rethink stories (shravanam mananam)
            aaroh - self helps, researches.
        D - ability to focus on object and to decide what's worthy of focussing 
            Initial Load - vichar, dharan, power of enquiry; ashtang.
            aaroh - long sessions of quality meditation or deliberation.
        K - scrum life for increased seva.
            aaroh - self management.
PIES - release - just express yourself.
    It's the same energy which when focussed and channelled properly shows itself as exquisite power.
    self confidence - what you know no1 else does.
    Eg - Gyani Zial Singh speech career - think of audience as kaddu.
    Eg - Papa - what you know about your PhD they don't know even a dime about.
IQGrats - Size of my spark job consuming existing shaded spark jar was almost double the size. Why? cuz provided scope not given so both in classes and in jar.
    GIT code only for reusability - the size of the spark job is your responsibility and no1 else's.
IQ - There is lots of reduction involved while working - there are so many ways something would work.
    if you want a specific way to work - then by contrasting with what works in scalable way, taking delte, etc
    reduce the problem to specific - and then check online or ask 7, etc.
    Work like a scientist - ability to explain away everything or reduce problem to its subproblems to be solved.
Sume - paytm vs Greyscale
    About - No matter what the decision - every action or choice will create a very unique destiny.
    Compensation of Greyscale is 1L + RSUs more.
    Spirituality
        use case is proned towards some 4 regs breaking - meat eating and intoxication.
    Proven and established vs its future in jeopardy.
    Coolest tech in DIP (OpenCV + full stack) vs Cool tech with spark, kafka, etc.
        probability of working on openCV and CNN is a little lesser cuz there will be a separate lab in future.
    Next work estimate - data engg and ML specialization, back to software with architectural knowledge 
        vs DIP on resume, software demand, entry into silicon valley.
    Smart associations - smart experienced people with greyscale; smart colleagues in paytm.
    Risk or Danger - instablity of startup, need for high passion (work always) vs knowledge hunt mindset.
        high expectations of experienced people
        need for concrete upskill for practically everything OpenCV, Backend, frontend, etc besides doing cool stuffs.
        Even if you want to see the startup culture it is better to see it gradually than abruptly.
    Brand Value - Paytm has higher brand value being established though not MNC.
    who has higher P(Reward)/P(Risk) ratio in general
        and also who has higher P(Reward)/P(Risk) ratio specifically - taking my beliefs and value system into consideration.
    Next, who has better contingency plan in case of risk facing.
        gap in past looks bad and anything that undermines my talents should be avoided.
        preferably cool brands on my resume that showcase my talent.
    Next, Which techs have greater demand/Supply ratio generally
        and also specifically considering my already expertise or cultivate-able expertise given my nature.
PIES - Group yoga to social yoga.
    In Group yoga phase, try to work with coolest of people for coolest of the things
        grow you capability as a team player.
        try to pick a work that doesn't violate the upcoming yoga tiers - like social or spiritual yoga.
        The case in point is just try - with fire there is smoke also and we try to minimize smoke but can't avoid it.
    Later in social yoga, it's more about working for social overall wellness or social well being (from sp perspective)
        or Ram Rajya (whether with or without Ram).
        the pursuit of action that will make 
PIES - this is layered karma.
    For a decision based on spiritual criteria - you may get a benefit of spiritual destiny but don't expect anything on lower layers.
    Every decision will have systematic results at separate layers as per the laws of nature, jiva and ishwar.
    Many make spiritual decision, expecting material favors - it does not work that way.
    So it is your responsibility to do justice to your psyche in the marathon of life.
    You know what the layered shreyas is and every decision creates destiny in terms of the tuple of all the layers of existence.
    So choices matter - cuz every choice is a destiny in terms of tuple of layers of existence.
    Some choices project very charming prospects of 1 element of the tuple or a dimension but at the expense of others.
    shreyas hierarchy - Ishwar, srishti, groups, individual.
        VA is also a path to transcendence - you are at a certain level of evolution.
        At every tier - the yoga is about oneness - in purpose and in grats.
        But while looking for maximizing yoga of 1 tier - make sure you ain't compromise (not necessarily maximizing) a higher tier (or shreyas)

Logs - Story - How I chose Samsung.
PIES - Stagifying our perfection to Krishna.
    For group yoga, personal yoga is assumed. Similarly with social yoga.
    benchmarks are high so we have to have sprint review every weekend to get the status report.
    Group yoga means I have become the group - honesty to tell flaw when it's there. Feeling good and bad wrt group.
        Why am I not sensitive to my home group - cuz I don't identify myself very strongly with that group - forget becoming 1 with it or being it.
    You go to Krishna after you become 1 with Krishna - it's not that easy - gradual evolution is thru tiers approach.
    With sadhana 1 can even bypass the tiers tracking but that's not the ideal way to go.
PIES - Mature growth is gradual.
    In KC we have summom bonum, the essence of all essence.
    But life is a journey to reach and live by that essence gradually with maturity.
    The desirable thing is to not deny it like stupid 
    but realize your fortune and align to the ultimate goal while respecting the stages of growth.
SQ - Karmic reactions are not the only principle - there are also law of attraction, strong desire of someone, and influence of kala.
CS - RDBMS
    t| Employee(t) and t.fName = "John"
    s.t, exists in table, dot operator, exists, For all, logical and or.
    Algebra
        set operation - UNION, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE (MINUS), cartesian
        relational operations - selection(SIG), projection (PI), join (|X|), set division (/).
        set functions - min, max, any, count, sum, avg.
        PI(SNAME)((SIG(PID=3))SP)
    Relational calculus to get requirements from query.
        Relational algebra to sequence operations for every instance.
        syntax mapping from there.
    PI(S.movieTitle, M.studioName)SIG(movieYear>=2000)(Stars X Movie)
    Q - select capability with all these specified properties.
        IN can be converted into EXISTS by moving where clause inside exists.
        OR can be converted into UNION by rewriting the previous query with where clause added.
    SQL Engine
        SQL
        Translation to RA (logical query plan)
        Plan optimization (optimized logical query plan)
        physical plan selection (along with stats and metadata)
        execution engine (refer physical data storage)
        result
    UNION - 
        JOIN as bad alternative.
        scalar subquery - replace projection clause with another select clauses from dual.
    INTERSECT - 
        IN or JOINS.
    MINUS - NOT IN.
    IN vs DISTINCT JOIN - no difference on unique index columns; otherwise IN performs better cuz of using hashes.
        EXISTS is more flexible but more prone to inefficiency.
    select * from bodyInput
Sume - IQ Bhakti - No problem even if I won't make a consuming application of spark-service-connection library but I did so that the consumer will have no difficulty.
    No problem if I let go off the Hilti thing job instability reasons but I finished it and shared my findings which he ack b4 taking up further causes.
PIES - Be like NodeJS while working, ERP, Big Data Batch, Big Data Streaming, Jenkins pipeline. From siemens also there can be something.
    Now is OpenCV time.

IQ - SAP IOT Farewell
    Awesome team
        the smartest people around and also helpful.
        Usecase is 1 of the finest and most promising for the world.
        Imran - his questioning style showcased that this is a team of bright talented people.
        Srini - use case convinced me that I definitely had to be in this team.
        Sathya - Initial intro.

            did you get it - I did. 1 of the most awesome teams I have found - if I didn't have personal reasons I would stay here more.
        How will I deliver big data stuff asked Suharsh from his buddy.
    Suggestions and Compliments from team members
        Ashok - You had great ML ideas going by your profile which we could not pursue but you can sharpen it in another project in future companies - many datasets online.
            we could not put you to the best use - the topics that interested you the most.
            Keep this passion at this age. Keep passions alive - take to next few years b4 bringing them to logical closure.
            with certain roles, it is very difficult to pursue these topics.
            You can reach out to any of us (Ashok or Hari) for not just ML but also any other engg topic.
            All of us colleagues are always there to help you.
            In general, Commitment - that whoever comes into our team is gifted with commitment.
                You tell them something - they find remainder information from different sources
                and next time you ask them they deliver you more info on that.
            For sure it will be difficult to fill in the shoes of all leaving - vacuum to be filled.
        Ajay - it's all how you take it. Appreciate the effort you put in the team.
            Good the way you have delivered things.
        Varsha - bugged for jira stories - that's why I said alert.
            what you have done in short time is appreciable.
        Kanu - I never worked with you but heard from others that you were good and will excel at whatever or wherever you are.
        Srini - commitments grow when in this team and bar is raised with the team is a great compliment.
            people think that they become better when they join the team - nothing can be better compliment to team and to themselves.
            commmitment goes up - when you like what you are doing, when you think that you are among the best, you feel happy doing it.
            normal days we don't say such things but leaving they speak their minds outta emotions.
            regret meeting you in person - pleasure working under you.
            Challenge is difficulty to bring in people as good as the one who are leaving.
                it takes learning curve and not all make the cut.
                challenge to make those finds - in this we had pretty good finds.
                unfortunately we lost you. Hope you will perform well in career - you are all young.
        Abhishek - committed for whatever task given but didn't interact a lot.
        Jagriti - great interactions.
        Suharsh - interactions of coffee hours in virtual setting.
    Ashok over mail
        I would definitely be missing your curious questions, many a times it had helped me to gather more information and strengthen my basics.
            I know onboarding is not an easy go in our team, still you guys did an amazing job, picked up things so quickly and started contributing to the code base instantly.
            Given the complexity of components we deal with, early weeks of DoD would be a nightmare but you handled with calm and ease.
            I am pretty sure the Spark connection check tool you had built would be very useful as we plan to extend our offering to different hyperscalers.
        Keep your curiosity alive and continue pursuing the innovative topics you had discussed with me, 
            all these along with your energy levels I am sure you will reach heights, I wish you all the very best!!!
        Please stay in touch!!!
IQ - Local user and domain user for every computer - after leaving, domain user is deactivated first.
FND - NFP - Architecture of Brahmacarya (both rituals and Pancharatrika)
    Prayaschit, Jedis Master, Strong sadhana, ability to tolerate dualities (JY)
    No access to seduction - importance of rituals - no escape - as strict as a smarta (at least to start with)
    lapse is theoretically always possible but better die fighting than to die like a coward - dying is no virtue btw - living is.
    at least a persevering person will get success later if not sooner but 1 who doesn't try has no hope.
    if you efforts yield nothing, that's a question mark on the strength of your tools - but we are open to reconsider eth.
    Who are social heros - so many recorded in history and contemporary judges, bureaucrats, etc.
    who are group heros - reference to famous people.
    when we try to be a hero without previous - it either does not work or does not favor others.
SAP - sweets to home. Alumni relations connect address being asked.
    gift hampers from our team.
SCMProd - Kaladi (roasted paneer), daliya pulav, Poha variants, Ice cream at home, oreo cake at home.
SQ - Vaidhi vs Raganuga which to practice.
    Action items
        focus on vaidhi bhakti as a ritual
        learn to appreciate beauty in everyday life
        learn to be grateful with reasons for every day experiences.
        do method acting for devs in lilas.
        What not to do
            imagine that you are a siddha
            immaturely think that Krishna is most lovable.
            life of philosophical ignorance
    Krishna is most lovable person is a conclusion and can't be a criteria for DS.
        Yes it can be criteria for DS in Raganuga Bhakti but not for Vaidhi Bhakti.
        We make a choice here for Vaidhi Bhakti cuz Raganuga is meant for Bhulok pastimes and is very immature otherwise.
            even suffers risks of sahajyaism.
    Can we have positive side of Raganuga benefits in our life?
        yes, with a little leap of faith - but lovable person is still quite big leap
            which can easily be wrongly proven wrong thru counter eg in life of duality.
        we can appreciate Krishna as most lovable person thru Imminence and transcendence.
            Imminence
                taste of water, etc.
                experiences of life personal or remote - yielding sense of gratitude 
                    thereby corroborating (and not proving) the lovable nature of Krishna.
            for transcendence
                experiences in devs life whenever Krishna descended as avatars
                    theater method acting or seeing world from their perspective
        having said this - it won't be our prominent path - our prominent path is vaidhi only.
            iow, we have to sincerely practice bhakti
            s.t we eventually realize that Krishna is most lovable.
EQ - Marriage
    Devil's advocate to extricate person's nature.
    As an experiment - Try for stress interviews where you disagree with eth and see how they respond.
        life is full of duality and I tend to take middle path so how can I foolishly agree on any assertion without seesaw effect.
        Take tough stands on things we naively agree that e1 is equal
            while this is true that e1 is equal but it's generic and naive understanding.
            more mature understanding is they are both special and not just generic equal.
            Still more mature understanding is that e1 is special 
                and we are just clustering them together with good probability 
                so that life is easy for us.
                of course, there will be lots of exceptions in the sets.
    Stay chaste with continence so that you ain't subconsciously unreasonable while approaching a person.
SQ - Tiers of Yoga thru DAKM
    Scale of Yoga - Yoga of personal yoga, group yoga, social yoga and spiritual yoga.
        While it's generally true but this is prominently important human lifecycle perspective (DAKM considered)
        KY is becoming more selfless and that happens thru this scaling.
        DY is becoming more involved with supersoul and that's with antarmukh or going too trans.
        JY is shastra cakshu and scaling your understanding thru all tiers and layers of material existence to self and super self.
        BY is developing relationship thru devotion (TME) - devotion is typically not 100% to Krishna but evolves to him thru tiers.
        But none of them are restricted thru tier evolution while it's practical way as per shastras.
SQ - BY essence as follows
    association (tadiya and Krishna) - triggered by faith or shraddha.
    thru Identity (being like him, relationship)
        identity changes from anartha based false ego to true spiritual ego.
    to Love (Prema) - visible thru following stages
        nishtha - firmness.
        ruchi - looks for time slots to devote TME.
        asakti - can't wait for time slot.
        bhav - emotions wrt Krishna.
        prem - the unconditional, unmotivated, uninterrupted, unadulterated relationship
            connection can't break
            by separation, mercy connection, ignore or snubbing.
    More - that's how all relationships are supposed to develop across VA.
PIES - Dualities of nature should not misuderstood leading to inaction.
    when we work hard in some direction we get success and it's lack of perfect action that sees success denied.
    Krishna's analogy explains it well - with fire there's smoke.
        We can try to minimize the smoke from fire but smoke is inevitable.
        Also, whenever we witness smoke, there must be fire somewhere - opportunity in adversity.
    So, we are not silent spectators of worldly dualities - it's a fact of universal experience.
        but we should still work for the fire and have fun with life (DAKM) but yukta and avoid extremes.
CRM - all try their best given their resources, mentality, etc to serve others.
    when they fall short, it's their limitation
    which can be quoted or ignored in FND behavior as apt
    but that's a fact.
    We should be sympathetic and empathetic towards them for trying their best given the state.
CRM - sb makes or passes judgments for others value and worth.
    the fact is that material world is involved.
        eb thinks that they are the best what's so special about it.
        1 way to motivate jivas for VA is thru fear platform - money is desire platform but also self worth at fear platform.
        both at ego and also for economic practicality to stay relevant for supply (psychology)
        typically the ones who are insecure feels the need to justify - the strong don't need to.
    The VA leadership of a person should ACK but we are never limited to any single person.
        even Krishna presents his substitutes for worship while no1 exists.
        what to speak of people passing judgments who ain't even in our group leadership.
        Such a person has been entrusted by existing leaders which should be respected no matter what the reasons.
        Eg - entrusted to marry and procreate, controlling some forms at work, etc.
        including but not limited to demigods - they are way too trans leaders for small leaderships.
    Your dharma is to serve in social or group tier to best of your capacity.
        In worst case VA can become unrewarding and then animal behaviors can show up.
        the change in world markets so switching your varna specialization may be inconvenient for some but ok.
PIES - women can be seen from different perspectives.
    women is sense object - senses.
    women are fun to be around - talking or mind.
    women can intelligently achieve something - tasks or intel.
    women can happily perform some role plays really well like child nurturing, home making, etc - ego.
    women are souls in their human body journey - soul.
    women deserve to be with Krishna in their respective svarupas like grass, gopa, jewel, etc - trans.
    More - the higher the understanding more evolved consciousness you have and more enjoyable it gets for e1.
        but strive for yukta of every layer but higher is always better.
SCMProd - Ghevar, feniya, malpua. Bhakarwadi, kachori, rajasthan dishes.
    Momos - which momo type do I like (fried, moberg, etc), which place, sauce / syrup, etc.
Movie - Loki
    Application
        She will get it b4 you - cuz you want it but she needs it.
        Into a realm - learn its all dimensions and move on with the game.
        subtle body remains the same even when the realm changes.
        How can I trust you - your stories reveals a lot about you.
            actions are louder than words - she sacrificing herself means far more words.
        extract information by doubting everything
            Quoting assumption as fact or making a theory to explain it all
            and eliciting clarification from other person who feels wronged.
PIES
    coordinating all entities together in spring boot to make an application.
    coordinating personal PIES for best services and grats.
    people coordinating together with different talents and expertise to make a project.
    different departments or fields with their specializations coordinating together to form a society.
    different societies coordinating and all drill down to ultimately 1 end result of helping jiva evolve.
    Grow as personal leader, group leader or team leader, to social leader, then spiritual leader.
SQ - aaroh deserves respect.
    st while emphasizing avaroh or aroh we underestimate avaroh.
    These are lines adopted by some to the extent to surrendering ones life.
    aaroh has grown over the years are it was supposed to - by the very definition of aaroh.
    problem is arrogance on aaroh or even little bit on avaroh side that the other is bogus.
    None of them are bogus and they deserve respect - we should adopt positives from both.
    Especially for me who has studied both very sincerely - I should have deep respect for aaroh and avaroh.

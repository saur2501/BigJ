HomeErp - Bike - Battery Dead Problem
	Use kick-start (if that option is available in bike)
	Otherwise, visit the nearest available service station/mechanic/battery repair shop to charge the battery.
	Call on-road helpline of the bike manufacturer (if available)
	Try to Push-N-Start the bike (like they used to start mopeds in olden days). This option may not work with many of the bikes. Not with heavy ones at least.

LIB - Scrum - How can we minimize the work - am I audible; Any ideas - pinpoint a person.
	you came prepared with probs then also ideas for improvements.
	Meeting-less day.
Scrum - Calendar blockings - when stuck then inputs from others - How would approachability work and transfers.
	some handholding for new colleagues - tailoring mode - dedicated 1 hr with buddies and 1 hr of development.
	reverse KT mode - where they come back of questions. This KT by new colleagues - not active members of meeting. Now question is how do I test it while debugging, etc.
	That I am ok with KT is one time effort but setting up system needs availability from devps.
	enabling them is the means - this investment is lacking from our side.
	2 meetings - reverse KT and trouble shooting.
	Action item - you book the reverse KT.
	API made to do primitive checks to help them forward the ticket to right time.
IQGrats - Suggested the idea of natural language processing on BCT tickets based on history.
	History we have - which team finally solved the ticket so use that to train a classification model based on NLP.
LIB - Scrum - We want war but don't have equipments with us - at least have backlog outside of release backlog.
	On any rainy day we try that, are we equipped.
	Looking for development work - this is a specific problem to be looked into.
	Task readiness - checklist b4 a task is picked.
	!DAG of tasks
	Let's add another stage to our jira board - release ready.
	If current functionality doesn't exist we will ask developers to make it. Don't restrict desires based on availability - standardize and plan accordingly but don't shy from take tools to ideal place.
	make claims it has deadline - this is money guys.
	Next time gimme lesser talk time - have no unmute button for meeting - I would rather have no mute button.
	Action items of last retro and what's the status with that.
	analysis - 60 reflections, 36 topics, 14 present.

Bangalore temperature (social erp).
	Transactional first and then Connected master data of everything.
	bike servicing - don't give papers and contact the regular servicing folks. Arch and maturity means not getting too pumped by desires, urgencies, fears, etc.

Story - Shared a pizza with a roommate. And also ordered sabjis and stuffs - getting a hang of getting social. Creating a happy ambience around myself.
Discussion - 
	Goats are tastier in India. Pork, etc in foreign cuz they take care of their diets. Chicken - foreign bred for meat vs India tastier - the colored birds.
	Licious has taken things ahead. Meat..sth is costly and more on variety.

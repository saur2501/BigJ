        Health- Games
        Hobby - 
            Poetry, Dance, etc included.
    FIN - Undercurrent.
    About - narrative is focus on either networking, Enjoyment or comforts (SRM and SCM Logistics) and money.
PIES - SVAF follow hierarchy - even though they are separate.
    Spirituality use case is to attain sat cid ananda - eternal state of enlightened happiness - thru best love and best service.
    Varna use case is favorable atmosphere for sp (@gamla); Cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for sp (like service)
        In abstraction layer, only use case is service (but for a reason, which is trans).
            Now, this gets hairy at this layer. FDDL incentives for varna - money, power, contributions measurements, love for your craft.
            Domain of your choice (social use case you serve) - your tools - configuration knowledge and POC and combining them aptly to solve a problem.
        other incentives like fear, desire and love (intrinsic) although very powerful, aren't official use case to start with but sure, help and drive the show alone.
        Any task can be better performed when you know the ultimate result it must yield.
    Ashram use case is favorable atm for varna and sp; cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for varna and sp (love, being organized, and being social consumer)
        layer of abstraction use case is enjoyment - love and consumerism (but for a reason and should help higher layers)
        This also gets hairy - FDDL incentives and what all to do in here to be socially smart.
    FND use case is favorable SVAF; cultivating utils for SVAF.
    Applications - so before starting any activity - what is the end result I want.
        Eg - child nurturing - we can't guarantee future but can act in suitable (best) ways that child and others cultivate necessary favorable attitude for varna and spirituality.
        Eg - marry - of course, fear and desire and love but primarily, acting in suitable (best) ways for varna and spirituality for me and others.
PIES - of course, we gotta play at godhead or demigod level to ultimately get there but we will also get checkpoints along the way - like being a businessman, being an admin, guide, etc.
SCMProd - Seera when sore throat. Daal ka desi ghee ka halwa. Motichoor ke laddu.
    salt over sensitivity - next day gargle water no salt and tea no sugar and I suspecting - later to learn nothing was added intentionally.
FND - Communication - Jokes involve involving different sources of information - Modiji lockdown lagate lagate haanf gaye yahaan ye corona hone par dance kar rahe hain.
    Change the context or reference - like layer of vision - like in comedy circus suddenly reminding them outta role into their real life.
    Ambiguity advantage, OOP jokes punjabi, etc.
PIES - To cultivate FND we need - knowledge and practice but also Role models, many eg to train over, etc.
IQ - Work like a scientist not just a productive worker - you are the one investigating and going the essence of eth and thru all approaching finally making it work.
    that's why I say computer scientist not computer engineer or computer techician, or computer worker, etc.
FND - NFP - tattoo, artistic, design, outfits, tasteful; It interferes with my immune system. It interferes with my TME investment on other dimensions worthy of investment.
    How much TME do you invest on your goals.
PIES - Tolerance is a very important concept. Take anything, you get what you tolerate. LCM emphasizes it, Krishna emphasizes, all yogis practice it.
    There's a penance or tapasya for a goal; on the path of which there are obstacles to be overcome - while it takes determination and discrimination to do it.
    encountering obstacles ain't a pleasant experience. REL get your hands dirty. You must tolerate it.
    You pay the price to get something (price of persistence and tolerance) but also sustaining something be it health in the material world - takes a price (persistence and tolerance)
    immune system works - it solves but we gotta tolerate while it does.
    You tolerate and be a good engineer when all that becomes easy but then you must tolerate next level to be an arch.
PIES - mind is a library - everything you put in - is gonna go in the warehouse to be organized - conscious of what you put inside.

EQ - I should love not only family, but also friends and relatives, next I should love my city, state, country and world (meaning people in there).
    This is what ashram entails as its goal.
CS
    If you don't use @Lazy, the framework creates a singleton bean at the application startup and makes sure that the same instance is autowired and reused in all other dependent beans
    REST Controller is multithreaded - It is not the case that the controller will block all subsequent calls while busy. It is multithreaded.
        REST controller is multithreaded as the DisptcherServlet handles multiple requests from the clients concurrently and serves using the respective controller methods.
        Your controller is a singleton by default and your service is singleton by default too.
        So, to make them thread safe - make sure that the operations that take place inside the service must be thread safe
        Use @transactional annotation in spring or implement it yourself.
        We can test this thru a variable increment - have a class with a variable able to take 3 values.
            Let the returned value increment over every call.
    Thread safe - lots of threads in a process will traverse thru a given object (class instance) methods.
        A class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads,
        regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of those threads by the runtime environment,
        and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of the calling code.
    Web App - starts with premise of n threads for n requests
        but nothing shared across threads except singleton objects and static class members - variables and methods of the class.
        All threads have different class instances to run on without a problem - nth shared but when threads work on anything shared - then there are potential problems.
        like shared class members or singleton class or classes with limited instances - then you have the problem of thread safety.
        Think of it this way - lots of threads are coming thru Our controller class. Any state information can easily be wronged.
    Rest controllers don't run 1 after the other - although controller instance is shared - all threads run it simultaneously
        so at any given time we can have n threads running thru the singleton controller.
CS - Arch - make 1 straight forward transactional DFD story and then think alternatives.
IDEA - Derivations and discussions. Also delivered in LIB so qualifies for sume.
    Create a transformation matrix for the TSS vector. Any product is also yet another transformational matrix. But convenient for the user.
        chaining of the rules is output becomes input for the other.
        This is being realized thru nested rules - rule that has rule as a function. Good idea. Called rule orchestration.on
        windowing - for sliding average - can think of implementing it in terms of sequences of previous one itself.
            but the problem of late comers. Integral as a solution. I would like to have it but how to explain to the users but gotta explain - not easy to sell.
        Transformation problem solution is quite a work.
            introduce 2 spark jobs - error recognition, outlier recog, and correction, UoM transformations.
            expensive to break everything around monitoring and data ingestion pipeline. Any idea to do it quicker.
            We lose many customers cuz we don't have these basic capabilities.
    Sequential circuits vs combinatorial circuits - when output becomes the input for the same or the other circuit.
        Sequential circuits - can realize polynomial functions of higher order.
        Not that design time team has to do it - even we can do it from inside our spark job - this can be proposed or implemented when time comes.
        @who needs it from hardware when software can do it.
CS - Refactoring
    Doesn't matter lines of code (5-15 is a helpful indicator through). method should do one thing and only one thing.
    Indicators that this is not the case -
        More than one level of indention in a method
        Paragraph Breaks - whitespaces between logical statements.
    fit on screen is very good - imagine if you have to gives reasons to a lawyer.
PIES - Foundation - It is about well being. Divided into 4 as follows
    Attitude - Internal or mental well being. Mental States - personal psyche.
        Can stretch this to include external conduct in personal space.
    Behavior - Well being with respect external conduct (personally or socially) - eg driving car, polity, etc. Social psyche (or personal well being in society)
    Communication - Well being thru Interactions or exchanges. Networking - micro-economics and fun
    Devotion - Well being thru being purpose centric. Scrum. Effectiveness or IQ Motivation.
    Conclusion - Psychology, economics and Motivation is at the heart of this.
        but also social studies for behaviors eg but that can always be studied under ashram.
EQ - Economics
    Price increase does not change demand (only demanded quantity). In economic terms, demand is a reference to how useful a good is to the customer.
    in economics, if they say “demand increases” it means people are willing to pay more for it.
    True demand has it’s root in fundamental human desire, not in economics. It’s a subjective measure of how important a good or service is to a person relative to other goods and services.
    So when we say demand increases, we are suggesting people have changed their view of what is important to them and they want more of a product than they did in the past.
    if ice were simply to become a far more popular product for people to buy, then the companies producing and selling ice might be able to produce it for less, due to economies of scale
    So in general, increased demand increases price when supply kept constant but if supply can be increased then economics of scale takes over.
    Similarly, lower demand, lower cost.
    Higher prices mean less demand. But High demand raises the prices.
    1 ice-creaming then bidding so price shoots. 100 icecream, price drops cuz you have replacements.
    Higher price (than value), you reduce the intake thus demand; lower price, then you over use it.
    So, price is just in middle and price and demand keep affecting and stabilizing each other along with supply.
    There's demand so there's price. Price rising, then demand reduces so you can't increase it too much.
    Study it as human behavior with respect to price in terms of supply and demand. The price is too low, people will desire it more.
        another study, market behavior of price, with respect to demand and supply. You know that people value this, you can rate it high.

    Delete some running unnecessary services cuz of quota cf org org_name, cf quota quota_name.
IQ - Presentation
    Organize your content.
        Theory and Practical should intersperse - practical really spices things up.
        specification, then end user presentation, architecture, code review.
    Practice 3 times b4 your presentation.
CS - Mac hierarchy - Good UXD.
    Apple icon -> list -> icons -> tabs -> list columns hierarchy -> individual controls / Demo video.

IQ - Lessons from College Alumnus senior Abhijeet of SAP who left for Intuit
    US Finance for tax filing - books maintain - us finance - real time transactions to be streamlined - kubernetes, apache kafka,streaming real time, it's not there yet
    it could batch - schedule they do - as much as manager said - that has to be real time.
    4.5 years now so have to see new - Any time no learning it's time to switch within or outside.
    do as much in 40 years - do as much good as possible by that time.
    Stable position by 40 years - monetary value and designation - it gets dangerous with time. Like pandemic.
    stable - work and money. You are young - design item pick.
    Brain you have - design item uthao - crowd - only few people are good - Ajay is good (a lot to learn from, can offer helps), kanu is good, ok, Imran is good.
    Baaki sabki dukan chal rahi hai. Tune dukaan nahi chalani - seekh karke nikalna hai. Grow more. Learn and grow - repeat.
    Get good work - this is old and deprecated. Old home work and then pick new work.
    New tools and learning but money is less - that disturbs.
    Less money should inspiration for work. People still can give you more money for work - but you gotta see both work and money.
        not step out just like that - money more and work also good.
        Know good work then good money not vv. Basics strong and then go out - lots of money in market.
        Private company this is the advantage it's not govt company.
        No deception here - learn till you know everything - what you do - ppl or can close eyes and tell it all. I know in and out - he knows business - he should be able to say.
        Less money will give you inspiration that I need to improve and get better.
        This is beginning - pick work then learning and responsibility comes naturally - if you keep sitting, that's what you end up with.
        More work you pick, more you are pushed forward.
        Work pickers are little less - pick a bcp and take help from others.
        BCP solving then you will understand the product - Ask ajay he will help - but need to go to him with knowledge - to ask him about M, you already need to know A to L.
        Accha sa Kaam utha - design kar, interest automatically aa jayega.
        coming from good place and have learnt so much that others won't know - so implement more than others - give suggestion.
        Behind the curtain won't give anything - Come ahead and speak - it's our team only. Speak out and you know so much that here people don't 
            not so much about showcasing yourself than giving really good suggestion.
            But b4 suggestion, read something about product - if that's feasible not selling knowledge - speaking anything without even knowing the product.
            wiki documents - product exploration - sap help document gives business knowledge.
            Ingestion pipeline - scala streaming code - no rocket science - only take input source is different from output.
            so take input from device. Output is time series. Spark streaming written for that. Cache written - transforms and gives something else. That's all.
            Know some spark and kafka - write some spark streaming app - then Confidence that I know things.
            Architectural understanding - product understanding and product programming then architecture is automatic.
        State spec - spark streaming lecture - it's a hashmap. Any language to learn is see its documentation.
            if keywords then you don't get anywhere - it's simple cache. If you hold onto something then you won't get it.
            Lectures see - conference, summits gotta see - some old ones really good. Faruki's is good.
            Some small product you should make in weekends - read spark like a guy came who didn't now spark earlier - he learnt - picked data from open source.
            and did streamlining on aadhar card and stored in redis - automatically understanding comes - for your own learning.
            don't think it is company's work - company's work is project. Technology is OSS and that is another project. Office we just more.
            But learning tech is first thing and then comes product.
        You need to look up to 7 - And I am not going till that date and there are many more people to look up to. take my number. Anyways from the same college.
    Hike is good 50% and your level it will be far more - market is not bad - market is good and they pay a lot.

CS - you can install cf thru brew, cf binaries, windows installer, etc.
IDEA - Instead of DoD checking status in 10 places - let's have an app or integrate with monitoring - which checks availability across apps in scheduled manner and returns error with which all failed.
    what about failed in past - kibana logs - ideally 500 response from any app can be configured to inform on slack / email or raise IOT alarms.
    But suggesting may reduce our DoD efforts and hence manpower. 2nd, this must have already been thought before. Third, building it means not focussin on our own IOT core work.

    You think you deserve Krishna. What do you understand about Krishna - what would you know of his value.
    //Somehow last statement got blurted out loud in front of all.
    What's his value - Ask them - they say - He is worth sacrificing everything.
    1 yogi said - he was worth all the penance; who got a glimpse of him after 1000s of years of penance.
    Ask devotees [like SP] who would not mind undergoing severe pains even if it leads to failing for his cause.
    Ask devotees who laid down their lives as it was a flower to offer in face of protecting other devotees of Krishna.
    Ask devotees who have given all their time, money, effort to Krishna's cause.
    Ask those who would wait 1 million years, if that's what it takes to see him again.
    Ask those who would beg to be an insect or dog in his servant's house to serve.
    Ask the gods who beg to be a grass to be trampled upon by his devotees.
    Ask seekers who sacrifice everything in his exploration to find his traces.
    Ask servers who work for him without any demand for personal remuneration.

PIES
    YOLO pinnacle is social validation like being a celeb for something.
    It has to be across the layers otherwise it will be shallow.
    The validation is goal when we are talking YOLO life but in face of legacy, validation is a utility only.
    Stabilization in SVAF means finding a niche where you become celebrity or get huge social validations along with worldy rewards and power.
    In SVAF world, you are a leader. People are leaders like being parents, being political leaders, etc.
    PIES Engineering should already get you to personal level SVAF or achieving ego gratifications on personal front. Social recognition would be good add-on, if possible.
    This social validation comes in different grain and 3 levels (CNI - Concern Need Interest - FDDL)
        You are helpful (not awkward or disturbance) - F or C.
        You are recognized as a menber contributor (accepted as one of us) - D or N.
        You are celebrated (celeb) - This should be our target - D or I.
        //Your love for craft is visible - L as fuel.
SQ - We are really fortunate that we got Krishna's grace in all the environment since birth that takes us out of MOI and MOP infatuations - anarthas.
PIES - I am NodeJS. Asynchronous threads - keep the context so as to return to them with all details when necessary. Time saved for something more useful.
SQ - why don't I just accept people the way they are - we really don't need photocopies of people.
    We need a variety of people and we should celebrate variety and difference of opinion instead of opening.
    How can we respect people in all MMN - we accept tiger for eating meat and don't kill it for its natural behavior.
    But humans can control themselves - it is rather our responsibility to enlighten them and if they still continue that's their free will. Isn't it?
    We can respect MOP for their dedication even if it's for grats. Respect MOI for their humanity and empathy.
    respect MOG for paying the price for alignment. Respect trans for their visions and goals.
    1 problem in past was that people in MOG hated MOI people which are so innocent - they deserved to be helped than hated. But that hatred has a recoil. That's what at least history teaches us.
    But that's 1 showcased problem - what about MOP hating MOI - kings or leadership roles exploiting the innocent labors - all the same.
    In KC, we rise about this MMN hatred.
SQ - Asura != MOP. Asura means exclusion of spiritual awareness - such a person can be in all MMN like MOG, MOP, MOI.
    Similarly spiritually aware person can also be in MMN until he evolves enough.
PIES - I have paid the goddamn price of MOG - people striving for enmity which you refuse. etc.
    You are manipulated into acting in a certain way - but I believe in acting in that way - don't refuse only cuz you are aware of it and refuse to accept manipulation.
    Doing dharma even if it triggers different feelings.

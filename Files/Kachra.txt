        Health- Games
        Hobby - 
            Poetry, Dance, etc included.
    FIN - Undercurrent.
    About - narrative is focus on either networking, Enjoyment or comforts (SRM and SCM Logistics) and money.
PIES - SVAF follow hierarchy - even though they are separate.
    Spirituality use case is to attain sat cid ananda - eternal state of enlightened happiness - thru best love and best service.
    Varna use case is favorable atmosphere for sp (@gamla); Cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for sp (like service)
        In abstraction layer, only use case is service (but for a reason, which is trans).
            Now, this gets hairy at this layer. FDDL incentives for varna - money, power, contributions measurements, love for your craft.
            Domain of your choice (social use case you serve) - your tools - configuration knowledge and POC and combining them aptly to solve a problem.
        other incentives like fear, desire and love (intrinsic) although very powerful, aren't official use case to start with but sure, help and drive the show alone.
        Any task can be better performed when you know the ultimate result it must yield.
    Ashram use case is favorable atm for varna and sp; cultivating tendencies (FND) suitable for varna and sp (love, being organized, and being social consumer)
        layer of abstraction use case is enjoyment - love and consumerism (but for a reason and should help higher layers)
        This also gets hairy - FDDL incentives and what all to do in here to be socially smart.
    FND use case is favorable SVAF; cultivating utils for SVAF.
    Applications - so before starting any activity - what is the end result I want.
        Eg - child nurturing - we can't guarantee future but can act in suitable (best) ways that child and others cultivate necessary favorable attitude for varna and spirituality.
        Eg - marry - of course, fear and desire and love but primarily, acting in suitable (best) ways for varna and spirituality for me and others.
PIES - of course, we gotta play at godhead or demigod level to ultimately get there but we will also get checkpoints along the way - like being a businessman, being an admin, guide, etc.
SCMProd - Seera when sore throat. Daal ka desi ghee ka halwa. Motichoor ke laddu.
    salt over sensitivity - next day gargle water no salt and tea no sugar and I suspecting - later to learn nothing was added intentionally.
FND - Communication - Jokes involve involving different sources of information - Modiji lockdown lagate lagate haanf gaye yahaan ye corona hone par dance kar rahe hain.
    Change the context or reference - like layer of vision - like in comedy circus suddenly reminding them outta role into their real life.
    Ambiguity advantage, OOP jokes punjabi, etc.
PIES - To cultivate FND we need - knowledge and practice but also Role models, many eg to train over, etc.
IQ - Work like a scientist not just a productive worker - you are the one investigating and going the essence of eth and thru all approaching finally making it work.
    that's why I say computer scientist not computer engineer or computer techician, or computer worker, etc.
FND - NFP - tattoo, artistic, design, outfits, tasteful, head towel; It interferes with my immune system. It interferes with my TME investment on other dimensions worthy of investment.
    How much TME do you invest on your goals.
PIES - Tolerance is a very important concept. Take anything, you get what you tolerate. LCM emphasizes it, Krishna emphasizes, all yogis practice it.
    There's a penance or tapasya for a goal; on the path of which there are obstacles to be overcome - while it takes determination and discrimination to do it.
    encountering obstacles ain't a pleasant experience. REL get your hands dirty. You must tolerate it.
    You pay the price to get something (price of persistence and tolerance) but also sustaining something be it health in the material world - takes a price (persistence and tolerance)
    immune system works - it solves but we gotta tolerate while it does.
    You tolerate and be a good engineer when all that becomes easy but then you must tolerate next level to be an arch.
PIES - mind is a library - everything you put in - is gonna go in the warehouse to be organized - conscious of what you put inside.

SRM - Chandrabhaga, east ghats, west ghats, indian ocean. Ganga, Yamuna, etc.
SQ - AN is primarily about BV to SV - svarth to paramarth. Selfishness to extended self.
    KY - thru VA service or Dharma finding the ultimate expression of union.
    JY - tattva darshan thru sattva path - DMPM.
    DY - life of absorption meditation - yam niyam practices to be able to do that.
    BY - 9 stages with anartha nivritti being from svarth to paramarth
        (maps to sattvik life JY; maps to yam niyam DY; maps to dharma parayan KY) primarily done thru Bhajan kriya (maps to tattva darshan or nididhyasanam; maps to meditation; maps to dharma parayan action)
        BK to AN maps in JY stages (Mananam to Nididhyasanam); DY stages (Pranayam to Pratyahar); KY stages (Dharma samashti - e1 to srishti - constitutional)
        Following this there's nishtha (Preaching) and growing interest in transcendence (Dharana Dhyan in DY; Sakshatkar in JY; parameshti in KY)
    This is more difficult to get perfection cuz it's a lifetime course and conglomerates all the yogic paths - common people can still perfect in stages and in other ages.
        The toughest road is that of anartha nivritti - getting across unfavorable after picking the favorable.
        Many don't even pick up the favorable whole heartedly so where's the question of next stages.

IQGrats - Habit of this.port = port while it had to be this.port = value - 
    case misplacement - causing 2 services.
FND - NFP - I am almost done with story of cultivating grats here. Now the story is mostly gonna be about how I got rid of this extremely deep rooted sanskar and vritti.
    Since birth it has been deep. Next, thru my life actions instead of curbing it, I have nourished it - culture could have helped and also could have hurted - I chose both with some bias towards latter.
    My solution phase has gone thru many phases. Some of them are follows
        Prayashcit Paschattap Phase - helped me a lot.
        Maximize layered grats - helped me a lot at the next level.
        Structured Streaming of layered grats - Config of Arch - this is gonna work wonders this addresses the problem at much closer to root level.
            The problem being - Life gets boring with streaming not proper or impedance in the streams - boring life or pain points in life.
            We gotta cultivate tolerance stamina (called grit) to avoid the pain points (iow, challenges - which should rather be choosed than accepted) 
            and proper plans or solutions to the streams impedance.
            For boring life or streams of grats not being proper across the layers (SVAF) - We need to have a thorough plan (IQ World) or lifestyle (abstract concrete mix) or approach (ask when in problem; seek help from managers; change, etc)
                And we should have alternatives and persistence to go on till we solve the tough challenges and experience far more grats.
                We need external validations and internal validations for SVAF - these incentivize SVAF in a huge way. So think along these lines - use concrete and abstract tracks. Short term and long term plans.
            When there is a pain - this acts as pain reliever or escape mechanism. When life is boring - this becomes a go to point - solution is have alternatives and reduce the need itself.
            Counters is a great help for this.
    The power of focus - I will get superpowers when I will focus my TME to SVAF specific goals - that's the key 
        super awesome people in world do extra-ordinary feats cuz first they want it strongly and second they are willing to pay the TME price.
        So, yes if you practice NFP along with avoiding distractions or escape mechanisms in other places like ignorance or extreme MOP - then you are bound to get super powers but in the direction you choose - one is free to still choose no direction.
    My life is SVAF - Spirituality in BJDK SQ and VA for KY primarily. F is the Fuel for all.
        I don't want just good VA or doing outta compulsion - I wanna do it outta interest or extreme fun - being in love with it - external validations and internal validations.
        of course, V has greatest portion in the day. Next we have Personal (Spiritual and FND).
        Ashram has lesser hours in the workday and more in weekends - but is very pivotal and has high importance - even directly satisfy the mind with lesser price and more rewards.
PIES - If only we learn from world politics and warfares - they all show human behaviors at a scale - it's about appeasing population for votes suiting their ideology. It's about winning the desirable ends from creating conflict or resolving an existing one.
    conflicts are always gonna be a fact and how people deal with them has lots of lessons on human behavior.
    FND is human psychology and microeconomics. Ashram is macro social studies and its concrete eg along HomeErp domain and SocialErp.
EQ - Civics - yes while females are disadvantaged in some ways and carrying a certain kinda subtle body with somewhat greater distance from perfection - they are also favored by transcendence
    thru sheer natural compulsions, limitations and social structures - they end up with lot of service attitude and proclivity towards spirituality.
    So, learn or take inspiration from this spirit of service attitude, etc. like Sita.
    From males we can learn sense of responsibility or dependability, being a leader (alpha) like Hanuman.
IQ - Social validations - company culture, Awards, peer when elicited on a user story, appreciating a user story which you worked on, people coming to you for help, 
    peers taking 2nd opinion from you, your presence was needed during ur vacations, Can't start the meeting without him.
    Extrinsic validations can even be implied - these are IQGrats outside of intrinsic sume based grats - it can thru an IDEA that got appreciated or a casual praise.
    Like a senior saying I see lots of potential in you. List these thru IQGrats which also includes Lapse btw which are intrinsic pleasures from negative axis.
    Group Discussions - Your ideas get recognition. Your contributions to an idea in flow. your opinions or feedback matters
        voice it anyways with pros and cons - that will be at least intrinsic grat.
    Implied praises.
EQ - Social Validations - remarks thru incidents that is so funny. That's so unique. Identity based praises he is so funny or poetic.
    Your knowledge is exquisite in this regards. That's an amazing story or you are a great story teller - involvement in a story - what about you choosing that.
    GD - the same remarks when offered by you and listened intentfully by others are also grats.
    All mentioned flavors of IQGrats with their social twists show up here - so this study is more foundational in a way.
Logs - Story - Breaking glass at shop in Bangalore - can pay them aptly but not more
    recalling incident of Udhampur person putting weight in book shop - how much? tu ghotala karega.
    Tuck shop - tasty chatni with samosa; Syami's tie up - got the same flavor once while coming back to ASR from Chandigarh.
        Tie up - it's not mindless asking which works but getting involved with them does - in fact, samosa becomes a minor reward in front of human connections.
        think from vendor's perspective it's nothing but with 20 to be carried - why would I give away - I don't want the feeling of being exploited.
Logs - Story - 
    Getting to have counselor meeting this time in bangalore.
        Called Saurabh Mehta Pr outta connections I was making with all devs and he connected me with the group while I was avoiding contacting them out of fear.
        Once he invited I could not refrain myself from going - no matter shame that I would feel.
    Casual walks and thanks giving for the car movement to Tejinder Veerji - led eventually to Kerela trip that I wanted before. What I story!
        Then in my mind I wanted Rajasthan trip - that was the idea that Surabhi didi came up with - I said yes without 2nd thought. Udaipur trip.
    Stories are always getting created - we just need to pay attention and organize them for discussions.
EQ - Your presence is celebrated like online interviews - why? cuz fun interactions. cool reveals, trivia, etc.
    even you celebrate others presence cuz that's a grat itself.
SAP - Interest groups - Games - basketball, volleyball, table tennis, cricket, music, dance, Rangabhoomi, Roadies runners. Sankalpa social services, Karnataka day celebrations.
SCMProd - Oat Parantha with raw veggies inside (carrot, capsicum, tomato, onion, etc)
    Dalia, Muesli, Bread butter, Peanut butter bread, Poha with crispy veg + curd + chatnis, Upma + chatni, etc.
    Karela, Ghiya daal, chappan kaddu, halva kaddu; all pulses. With chatni, raita or curd, brown rice, salad or boiled beets.
    Sandwiches, double decker sandwich.
PIES
    Spiritual Story - extrinsic and intrinsic pleasures.
    Sume development - Chanting Bhajans journey, Yoga Meditation Journey, Knowledge journey, VA journey (donations included) - that's intrinsic pleasures.
    Social validations - whenever 7 said me something - preaching, new comers. Juniors, seniors, equals.
SQGrats
    HG PSP - hey STW VTW for you only you must attend.
    NIT JSR - Sab moh maya hai. I won't attend that session on Krishna is SPOG. Saurabh is not in our competition.
        Cow Milk started. Jack of 50-50 partitioned further into 25-25-50.
    Jumping the gate to enter. I won't stop him from using my cycle but sth is objectionable. More of a story than SQGrat.
    RSP - He is my old friend. Give this laddu to one with most beautiful dress. He will do something special (of course, besides grat this is also my regret)
    CCP - congratulating on good article.
    KTP - Reading the book and finishing Salted bread.
    Gauranga Pr - Why not use broom in vessels if it's all spiritual. Go have your meals. You heard Daily BG talks on Atma series - what's your name.
        you are still in Pune. Are you married. In Chowpatty - RSP students are very sharp - on asking what my soul means - it means you need to do more services.
        Should not tell KC is difficult that bluntly - yes I should take permissions from you, right.
        Kolkata dancing on Narsimha Arti.
    RNSM stroke in the head in Chowpatty on obeissance to him while walking past the stairs.
    Your Mangal arti is very absorbing - I didn't have it since Mandali Bhadra Pr last came.
    Devarayan Durga or sw - What a kirtan - that elicits emotions while it's going on - feels so heartfelt.
    Shayan Kirtans celebrations in YOGA phase. Shloka recitation - Brahma samhita st in the morning - drama anecdotes in MP and Quiz from notice board with awards.
    VAP - brutally honest. So, many praises in our festivals and celebrations but I have not kepts track of them.
    Even with beginners we can have SQGrats of preaching - like we awe our seniors. ISKCON is such a great acronym.
    Lots of KC centered deep friendships - many of them - some being Jyotirmoy Pr, etc - lots of revisits in Bangalore and even in Pune.
    Many many more but I never kept track of them b4.

    2008 - Moving out to explore acads but unfortunate internal reality to explore NFP. Burst of tears. infrequent chanting.
        Later IDT stuffs. But also worldly artworks and poetry - wasted. Poetry revisits with KC connection.

    2009 - internal anger going to Nityanand's mercy giving place. Jagannath Puri Yatra and small experiences with Gauranga Pr.
    2010 - Mayapur visit and deep spiritual experience - Irregular chanting.
    2010 - I will be waiting, waiting for you - choosing Pune over Chandigarh swap. Atma series. Chanting few rounds - enacting drama alone.
        repeat exam - hearing lectures - Practically MOI to MOG thru MOP.
        Chanting searching for a devotee - Bangalore call from KTP and Chandan Pr - heard there was 7 - searching with bead bag to find 7 - met 1 with tilak whose guru would eat butter becoming Krishna - his room visit.
        Ritwik temple visit in Mysore - any sanyasi's here - who are you - I am only interested in KC not political stuff - they still dropped me at weird place with no bus.

        Sunday streaks - 16 rounds. Still some camps.
        Siemens - understanding the strong need to be atheist when it comes to expecting sth from Krishna.
    2020 - asking Krishna for mental help - depressed with greatest complaint against Krishan than others - reduced faith in trans, karma, etc 
        but reinstated with a little thought and maturity in KC - that 3 doers always.
        Learning to be more practical while in KC and deeper insights into stages of Bhakti (importance of anarthas (inclusion of MOI based also) and dangers thereof)
        Importance of all the spiritual paths including atheism and aptheism, impersonalism and where they fit in the jigsaw - where they should be adopted and given up.
        1 round streak. With plan to chant Ekadashi extra and special days extra.
Sume - SQ - Uncat - not arranged as per time.

        pleasure of getting served prasadam from him in camps.
        He will settle in here.
    Laddu in exchange of tough words - are we qualified to blaspheme LCM's blasphemer - foolish of me - but greatness of him.

PIES - MOI - In general, sloth or laziness in its gross sense but more profound that you want reward without much investments.
    all escapisms or entertainments also fall under this category - but that's not as bad as high dopes
    So, our entertainments should also be well planned and limited - too much MOI leads to MOI becoming a tendency - attached to MMN so the solution is restricted planned entertainments.
    Even sleep can be seen as bodily requirement (MOG) or fun / escape (MOI)
    Now, not that we pay no price for entertainments - that's why it's MOI tilted but st it can be MOP also.
    Ideal life is MOG based - you decide the best course of action to an end and play accordingly.
    Man nahi karta is a typical MOI saying - I extracted the fun outta it is a MOP saying - we have to rise to MOG - where the pleasure is more sophisticated.
    Even entertainments can be MOG based - planned and serving a purpose rather than fun seeking or driven exercises.
    pure fun seeking entertainments can be planned aptly within threshold like MOP anarthas in threshold.
    There is nothing called pure gold - 24 caret but purer the better - it's like that when SP says 70% pure is enough for BTG - it's difficult to assume that we will stop thinking about self at any point.
        But it's reasonable that more advanced people (even from worldly standards) think more of others than themselves.
PIES - MMN have huge bearing on the SVAF.
    Varna is more in MOP in general but can be practiced in MOG as well - MOI gets disapproved.
    Ashram can be MOP but tends to be more towards MOI - Ashram can also be practiced in MOG if planned properly.
        that's 1 reason why the time slots of Varna is typically higher than ashram.
PIES - The trap of foundation is very clear - when there is no sense of incompleteness felt - no dissatisfaction or discontentment or craving for more completeness,
    and still 1 is forced to act - it does not have that strong fire which a man with yearning shows.
    So, worldly escapes make us feel satiated already - then we question why do I lack the fire to act or we act in luke warm ways - cuz foundation isn't strong.
    that's why spirituality encourages MOG and not breaking 4 regs - cuz that's turning off the fire - the bad foundation will show no fire for the end goal.
    That's not deprivation - SQ doesn't favor denial either but MOG based fulfillment and no escapes or enjoy without paying the price.
    Not breaking 4 regs ensures at least MOP - with more refinement we can move to MOG which are ever better platforms for transcendence. and are closer in themselves to trans.
    Imagine when foundation is proper and you keep on developing your personal self - you will constantly have that fire that you deserve more. How favorable this is to perfection!
PIES - Social applications of PIES understanding
    Spirituality is a layer above SVAF with F being psychology and microeconomics - this clearly indicates that Spirituality can't break the principles of SVAF over which it is itself based.
    If a spiritual school, breaks the society or builds strife among people or is against economic development or is counter to psychology - like suppression (this isn't equal to control or regulate), we need to reject that school.
    if I tell you to do something which is impossible pscyhologically cuz of us being SCA seeking beings by nature - then that proposal has to be rejected.
    There are examples of mass suicides arranged by unscrupulous teachers who said aliens would take them to ever beautiful place if they die in opportune moment.
    If spirituality encourages you to fight with family (not talking trans here) or discourages social contributions - spirituality at its layer above SVAF will break the civilized society principles itself which supported it to exist.
IQGrats - Syami saying your sitting is awesome.
    should not fear laziness cuz once in a while exception is ok - mar mit nahi jaana - getting paid for the day - ok exception and can even be honest about it or explain it away.
IQGrats - winning many arguments and accepting also while discussing with Ajay.
    My ideas accepted for derivation jobs by Ashok. Many ideas accepted in different phases of discussions.
    Understood the strengths and weakenesses of all the peers - so really knowing the stuff working on. Helpful colleagues is characteristic of SAP.

CS - Code Review
    remove the hardcoded credentials
    remove commented code
    remove not really needed parts like this class serves no purpose
    Avoid using print stack trace - plan the exception hanliong properly.
    You don't override comments from previous team - that's like insulting the reviewer.
    remove unwanted dependencies from pom - use properites when recurring versions.
    always avoid sysouts - logs for production readiness
    avoid constants in the code - read from property file.
    Follow standards for naming - self explanatory in the large picture - name => respnsibile person.
    Don't write credentials in code even for testing - that's like revealing a lot to possible seers of the code.
CS - Spark Cassandra - Cannot build a cluster without contact points
    cuz url can actually not be found - it had extra quotes

    learning their approach of doing things and discussing their suggestions - validation over the best outcome - we will finish this big story.
    When their mature ideas also come as suggestions.
    I don't have to fear laziness for 1 day cuz I make up for it the very next day with huge overtime - our field itself is so interesting.
Movie - POTC - On stranger tides - Mermaid based story - best installment acc to me.
NFP - Lick; Replay - Normalization based
    P should be taken seriously - it's a small lapse which should be accepted. If you don't sequence will follow.
    Sleep should be valued - Learn how to increase the value of sleep when it's time - thru affirmations, retros over the day, planning next day and deep breathes.
    It's all about microeconomics - I choose what I value the most with my TME - I really think indulgence is more valuable than abstinence.
    Instead of days let's have a 15 weeks redirection protocol.
        I will have journal with what's the week's personal agenda, and a topic or book focus. At least I owe it to myself.

EQ - Game - make 6 with 2 hands.
Sume - EQ - I feel fortunate to be born in Punjab and of my family member therein.

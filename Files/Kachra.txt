Scrum - TODO - DayNotes - gotta organize EQData, EQ, and small sections - Discussion, Polity. Health needs to be renamed.
Story - CTO called Syami for work continuum - I don't mind increase my package - see their are constraints - it's ok then.
PersonalErp - When you have seen the worst (5 lakhs liability for marriage - thanks for minimizing the liability otherwise), you have reason to lose all the fears cuz now you can venture on adventures cuz nth can be worse that than that. It's an incentive to play fearless with full enthusiasm. Now go on doing purchases with cultivated cautions - any loss will be nothing in comparison to what's witnessed.
Communication - Syami attitude - if discussion is not in the direction that you want, change the track to a story or give a twist but have fun in all discussions.
IQ - We are talking about the culture where every change you make is eventually meant to be demo-ed by you.
	So, this is also experience to be captured in project level details or sume - sume actually.
Story - How free we are - candle passing. Road Safety India first - what difference it makes I still drove at 150 to come back to home.
	Got insulted there and said people so much enthusiasm - saying as if we were not there. Drishyam style.
CS - Generally RuntimeExceptions are exceptions that can be prevented programmatically
Communication - Pivot to persons and interactions - individualized stories and interaction stories.
HomeErp - Papita ke parotha.
Sume - Vishesh Leaves the team - bored with software devp it's same repetitive and would do business or MS GRE applicable for 5 years thinking Data Science and not software anymore
	Can we do anything to retain you - in different team if not this team. You got another offer like it's normal.
SAP - Diwali Gift Amamzon voucher and Diwali Gift box. Appreciation Voucher. Home Office Setup.
IQGrats
	Postman run failing with route not found error. But app already started in cloud foundry!
	cf logs appInstance - process web has crashed. Started otherwise. starting again would say already started so you think it's running but it has crashed in logs.
		a little wait and stacktrace also shows up. The problem was infinite recursive call of getMessage method - used this.getMessage instead of super.getMessage().
	Had to compare 2 json entities - 
		used JSON Query - JMESPath Tutorial - results[*].[name, responseCode.code] 
		json to csv converted to convert to excel and then used cells operations to compare if they matched thru subtraction and they did.
Sume - Etherium based Project - Leadest.pro Startup - Lead Generation program
	51% goes to the development pool that is locked for three years (unlocked with equal parts each month)
	39% goes to the founders of the project. Locked for three years (unlocked with equal parts each month)
	10% - Liquidity reward pool on Uniswap. Trade our pool to get free tokens.
	10% commision of the service from all stakes
	Trustless - Ethereum wallet to start - no trust involved.
	Permissionless - settlement of the quotes are made on Ethereum smart contracts with a public oracle - Chainlink
Relp - Let's see how baby behaves when his mother is being loved by her mama. etc. different configs.
Communication - everything can be talked about saloon, your social media life, your experiences with different social erp, home erp, personal erp etc - eth is a world in itself.
CS - 
	Language Basic - OO capability, functional, Pointers, etc.
	Language Libraries - Console, Sockets, GUI; etc.
	Types of Apps - Extensions, Console apps, libraries, Runners, GUI apps (Mobile apps), IOT Apps, web apps, web services, distributed apps.
	Most of them leverage pre-existing libraries, frameworks and platforms for making scaled apps.
	Business Problem Domains - ?Enterprise (could it be a different type of application), scientific, gaming, big data.
CS
	JVM = Java Interpreter + Threading + Garbage Collection, etc.
		envt to execute .class file
	JRE = JVM + Libraries (rt.jar, files for IO, Net, AWT, etc)
	JDK = JRE + DevTools (javac, java, etc)
PIES
	Techie - you are a function, no memory expected.
	Engr - you are an object - give services when asked for (in different chains).
	Arch - you are a service (software or business service like photo printing) or platform or framework (OR feature or capability - to be leveraged OR problem solver, given a situation) like a DB or GUI or socket programming
		see a problem out there and work out a solution.
	Sci - you are a theoretical completeness of a topic (what's possible) - the essence (or know the essence)
Scrum - I am currently at engr state where I am an object which gives services when asked for but doesn't take initiatives to offer services.
PersonalErp - Getting Things Done
	Getting things done
		Capture - collect
		Collect process what it means
		organize - put it where it belongs
		reflect - review frequently
		engage - do what needs to be done.
	Supplies, material - eth else sth to do sth about - open loop - mind sweep - removing that has your attention. Write it down. Leave in head is leakiest place. Like pen paper. voicemail, whiteboard.
	Clarifying - mom, credit line - what do they mean and what to do.
	stuff in basket - actionable - yes or no - maybe is no - if no? trash, incubate (Hold for while b4 decision), reference material. If yes? what's the very next action - granular action for project - setting meeting is not an action. Project is outcome with > 1 actions. Project plan.
		Action < 2 mins - yes do it but not whole day. No - delegate it. defer it like ppt making.
		Do delegate and defer.
	organizing - where things should go - defer
		calendar list, next actions list - 1 list huge so context so office list, phone list, computer, errands, etc. Project list like mom birthday etc.
	reflecting on the tasks - review frequently - 
		weekly review. Reflect on projects. look forward and backward. Schedule.
		Latest and loudest grabbing attention isn't always the best thing to do.
		Engagement - clear psyche to make judgments.
CS - Cloud Foundry - org

IQ - Lapse - Educate him about using parameters in postman - I didn't defend my position or offend anybody which is a small concern but ok for now.
	I was expecting the regression or integration testing infrastructure to be working outta the box. I didn't even bother to open and check the call getting made.
	There is nothing wrong with this expectation but experts don't even need a demonstration of working piece of code. They will make it work if it doesn't work already.
Uncat
	device model to thing model.
	I wanna behave like function but expected behavior is to be more like objects with member variables and supporting behaviors but primarily functions.
	proof of correctness, could it be done with better performance, or cleaner approach or more rugged approach.
	Rode Gittiyan uchhalne waali game that we used to play in childhood.
	chidi ud kaan ud, jumping, face expressions, stunts, pose, game plays, situations creation like ball going under the sofa, waiting for him to ask for help, ball snatched, his cloth on you or drinking from his bottle pretension, etc.

SAP - Job Sharing - managers aligned on capacities swapped with someone else - working in tandem. Fellowships, Intern, offline, etc.
context id, bad format context id, context name, bad context name, nothing.
Exceptions - throw and test.

connect - spark to kafka, hana, cassandra, redis.
	status chck from my spark app - all connectsions are successful.
	catering to multiple landscapes - sth or other doesn't work - no straight means to chck without scp - reachable from spark clusters or not.
	get this on scala - get your hands dirty and bring as jira task.
	fresh opinions. daily review. PR open invitation. being bypassed. Block 7 time in their calendar.

LIB - How are spark jobs created - launch spark cluster using mds or amd application mode in the manifest file - after launch - submit jobs using the endpoints available there.
	we can't do ssh to create jobs.
LIB - Scrum - Backlog burndown is very important - proof of continuous work.
	capacity planning, working hours, daily standup, backlog burndown tracking, 
	go and be what you want - world changes according to what you want and standardizes it. Just like driving.
	As per Roaster.
	Archs talk about what's in the code and where's what gets picked from and what's the code working at discussion level. Eg - That API works only with that platform.
		so UML etc capture details really well to be able to communicate well.
	List all backlogs - allow every developer to create - create ranking during the planning meeting.
	Source of user stories - BCP, Customers asking, We feel the need, Something interesting or innovative.
	On different thread; on a side note. I don't see it would be possible by that timeline but we can accomodate it somewhere in sprint planning.
Story - VOIP from director. Given away to CS dean.
IQGrats - I used snagit Desktop2 to hide the window on taskbar.
LIB - Scrum My User Story - Interesting item - landscape set up done - spark to services unavailability is big puzzle. Whitelisting done or not done - scp - big hungama every time - based on env spark job spawn and do nothing but connect to services and print log or error out.
	initially thinking under data ingestion job but now to derivations spark job - cuz TSS doesn't have redis connection.
	enable env - connection checks - set to true - derivation spark job in mode - only do connection checks alone - default value is false. Remove and bring in to usual business.
	New landscape being built - pipeline won't be in place - why not separate application. Ops also deploys via pipeline. Maintaining separately - after going live - comes with its own complexity. New processes. 1 single spark module - need to handle the spark job life cycle - switch to spawn spark job else our own - how will it be any different or difficult - additional codeline will be maintained.
	additional hanabox, cassandra box no longer needed.
	deploying jobs in separate clusters is always possible for us. Healthcheck should be prerequisite for any of the jobs - even if enabled with or without flag, then also fine.
	Java applications health checks - along the same line. Let's get this started.
	Issues cuz TSS create connections when talking to spark job - TSS ain't serializable - all I want is select dummy from hana. We need to have IP - from service binding - we pass service credentials so I can reach the cluster. 2 cassandra cluster - given in vcap binding.
	don't initialize any library. Only read write in redis, hana - JDBC connections possible is the intention. Extendible to other services to later on.
	all these flags have been passed b4 proceeding for all spark - can be a builder. Postgres.
	Any common library like DI Utils - thought of putting under utils and reuse - I realized that we don't have connections.
	do separate application - once comfortable then plug that logic to existing application.
	Let him get it done and tell him where to place that logic. We can have discussion where to place it.
	he also needs to understand what we are talking - schedule another discussion.
	Not on friday - telugu news. IPL not interesting.
	space booking to be included as well in KT.
	I will get knowledge from Imran.
	Once saurabh comf with perf - schedule it with framework. Move this to next sprint.
	Schedule a meeting on Monday for app for spark health.
	Retrospective compulsory - improve or ease ourselves
	streaming marriage - coming and going in slots. Shadi par log kam the.
Movie - Animal Instinct. survival island. cat skin.
Story - NIT JSR Guest Room with papa. I3TB Guest room joining 1st day.
Polity - Excellent strategy - first you give expenses and then we will give - effective communication so that we can decide accordingly and are not setting up the motion.
	why the heck worry for few 1000s when each child earns > lakhs per month. TME wasted costs us more.
Story - KGP trips for NPTEL Lectures. JSR trip for IISER and IIST - social exposure.
SocialErp - in Legal system, even the winners lose TME.
PersonalErp - situation elicit emotional resilience and mental robustness so SQ is important.
Story - anything you run after gets finished. Keys for room after joinging SAP - not getting so did it myself. Of course, such incidents don't help my perception of thinking low of people.
SQ - Atheism and anarthas are important. Atheist is also 1 view of AT like elephant perceived by another blind man or a projection of higher dimentional reality.
	Anger in MB, Hanuman, etc. SQ evolution you transcend the taste for them not value - you don't fight people would standardize accordingly.
	No lust is a medical problem and so is over indulgence. Ideally only that taste for KC >> taste fulfillment from lust.
	Importance of atheism - not that god doesn't exist but a need for determinism of material world without a need for God. Bus missed not cuz god wanted but cuz of bus timings that you didn't know. Why did medicine end cuz eb else consumed it.
	Getting a DAG is more of a surprise in the pursuit of purpose or meaning from transcendence - rather we make purpose and it's surprising to sometimes see that universe assisted us.
Story - Keys are pointers - carried keys with me to Amritsar and car keys double pointer - so couriered them to a friend - importance of networking. Of course this was also a lapse at proper planning. Should have kept a copy of keys already and kept 1 in kitchen and that's what I did later also. Exception handling of eth you do.
	Dependendability of social systems like couriers in precisely the number of days.
Story - mama locked in partition while in bathroom cuz I didn't notice that door was only link and closing it meant creating partitions. Automatic kitchen lock once so mama did cleaning and kitchen work until morning but in worst case it would prolong many more hours.
	Need for IOT and GPS at home to locate things and people. Recall once falling in bathroom and once on floor - these are very discouraging incidents.
Story - being locked inside room at I3TB. Bad example of GPL birthday bumps and hospitalisation at NIT JSR. Once one boy in toilet and died later cuz 50 days holidays started.
	locking mama in udhampur. once being locked in VIT pune but calling a friend saved my day else would end up sleeping there for night.
	At SAP getting to meet Infy friend, VIT Pune student, previous team member in next team, I3TB colleague.
Communication - talk about achievements - process, abstract and concrete - assist others in their transactions or spirit.
	Need runtime thinking while doing presentation (based on design time thinking) with a customer - topics come from personal life, home, office, social, etc.
	Home products and services - when to use what and experiences.
	Content comes from personal and interactions spaces. It has CRUD - Create a conversation, Update, Delete, retrieve. Runtime thinking could be muhavare, add on stories, jokes, emotions expressions, politics, etc.
	Similarly CRUD for all 3 tiers - personal home social.
IQ - High value service pays far more than low value business - eg facebook emps earn > most of the business empires.
	Prio for earnings - Freelance for market value increase, Investments, IOT Device - smart watch integration or alexa integration, Uber earnings, etc.
Story - being invited to marriage by Raja, and a college friend but missed them. Topics of discussion - BYD haal, relevant jokes on marriage, new rewards, covid situ.
	why not vacate the room was the proposed idea.
PersonalErp - bhola vs chalak :: Naive vs pro in human psychology.
	Karma vs agnostic - subscribe to karma but keep agnositism as default.
Story - 2 for joy and 1 for success - yes but habit cultivated so even after saying that eyes still crave for 2.
Polity - things gotta be quantised 0 or 1. can't keep in middle like Nangal - they wanted their money back and have an exit of extra mbills for money and once that closes they had to use courts. Fortunate else more money would have been spent given our nature.
Story - yes we girls like it but you have to be in mood to do it. Agar aap khush hi nahi ho karte hue. But why so - cuz against willingness. I wanna know you first.
	Highest probability she was forced to marry - justifications to father. Her father regular bag of shit but college politics (recall VIT Pune - I will fail him if you don't apologize in written). In absence she could narrate any story. Blowing things outta proportion as revenge of force. Act from which she could never rollback.
	took hand shelter in car, head massage on wedding night, headaches, pullbacks, not talking while journey to golden temple saying that reason is personal.
Communication - Discussion prio - Transaction, Config, master, analytics X past, present, future X Personal, home, social X Do, understand.
EQ - max leverage from Nangal episode - how to charm a girl and be her hero.
SQ - Decision making made easy - Bhakti (DS) > Seva (VA). Grats allowed but not dicision criteria > Health - weakness of avoiding loss so confusions - face them. Bhakti means act with right intent or not - worry about goals. Avoid ati prayas, action aligned with nature. Maximize grats with seva.
Scrum - speak like an IAS.
IQGrats - Postman not working so compare it with what works - the jmeter scripts. Get hang of terms and compare with what's already known SRM ML on SIV.
Story - brining ashvagandha in house - ppl look for delta in behavior to figure things out. Conform to them and internally one can deviate to hide things.
Story - mistake of dettol drunk from listerine bottle - worst choice of bottle to put dettol in and taste buds gone. Scary but I would still eat kachori and recall the old taste.
	god's sense of humor and mithai also came in that time from sap and went to haveli as well in that time only.
PersonalErp - ABCDE (Attitude, behavior also persoality, Communication and concerns, Devotion, Experiences fun - focus for resume).
HomeErp - office is also a home but more focussed on varna side instead of ashram one.
SQ - maybe asur but st they pay the goddamn price > demigods just that they are not aligned. Eg karna jarasandha - can't be demigods cuz not aligned but price they pay is huge to be god of the arena.
Communication - Stories focus on cautions - predator prey with different roles - heroes - paying the price for being hero. Scrum focus on being a hero but cautionary tales.
Story - principal said he had not sense of taste. Even Christopher Nolan is colorblind.
EQ - Ashram - logs across for story but essence in reume.
	Bupa (internal and external), Field understanding. Personal amusement for eg.
	Home focus on products and entertainments streaming and social focus on news and services consumption
	Mindset is that of seva and also bhog.
HomeErp includes stock non-stock, lease products. ERP contribs - seva. 
	Cook, finance, clean, seva, chats, many stories - entertainments, snacks, icecreams.
SocialErp - NGO book distribution in school, Food for life so a lot of social Erp service I have done.
SQ - Krishna is impersonal thru material natural laws. Passive controller but active controller is more of a retrospective realization. We can't override material laws but just adapt ourselves for science and tech.
PersonalErp - driving skill - interest in hobbies and concerns like car parking - using networking.
HomeErp also you keep making stories.
Story - wifi access not there so asked and she asked parents for it and hacks I knew to figure but asked it anyway from brother.
SQ - We are the proof cuz we as souls defy laws of physics every single moment - not our body but us. Inner sound of paramatma but could very well be intuitions based on experiences.
	DYS 1 proves existence but not active controller part.
	Law of attraction proves sth. Desire or karma - not always visible - exposure or revelation cuz universe has a narrative and not chance like dice.
Story - Power of Pain - eth else pales when I faced the trouble at Nangal. Nth worse could happen I thought. What if 7 thinks wrongly - let them I said. After witnessing this what else is remaining to be witnesssed. Thought it won't hurt if car topples. Got solved early is in a sense Krishna's grace.
	Sin of ignoring the social layer. Maybe not a sin on spiritual layer but it is sin on worldly layer. Maybe 3rd class person is shit from karma in metaphysical space but on social or legal front he proved to be smart (or may be not). But if you can't fight or you are lousy person then that's also your fault that you don't know that sport.
SocialErp - O(n) or O(n^2) - constants don't matter so saving some money in consumption - 15K per month on graph line slope but gaining in lakhs.
	but interest not in just starting point but also the slope. So you have assets but after some time you start to see a lossy deal if you don't act. Some people place so much value on their work or rework that they would rather lose money on rent than to set things up again later.
EQ - Marry cuz Personal home, Social X insecurity , desire, growth, love.
SQ - Yoga also means alignment of mind, senses (working and knowledge), intel - else just mind can land a person in troubles like moth.
Story - don't forget lapse episodes cuz they are fuels for leveraging.
HomeErp - Home is for experiences. SCM, SRM, CRM, SCM Production and logistics and planning, HCM and FIN and foundation.
	Guest frequently and funs; HCM for entertainment and projects. SCM Production for cooking, SCM logistics for decoration and cleaning. SRM != Social shopping - it's design time and runtime. Partners are gonna be primary sources of grat streaming not just things - things are more like means.
	In ashram awareness is perfection not ego specifically. Fan speed, ac mode etc.
	Home is runtime and social is compile time.
EQ - for scrum roll it up in dimensions like time space and layers. End result being ESMD or FDDL in general. Scrum blocks for day week month year decade lifetime.
	communication is also layered personal home and social external partners.
SQ - Use KC increase SV and decrease BV. Less tolerance and any service less reciprocation so frustration. More expectations of grats and small boring stuffs so consumerism grows.
	with that comes exploitative mentality.
Sume - SocialErp - FFL marketing, polythene awareness, scout and guide, drama etc. Personal services like guidance to others.
PersonalErp - Eb tries their best so no perfection but pursuit brings best outta e1.
Story - make story outta eth like for HIMYM. Make it into a story.
SQ - NFP - favorable not - physical - overeating, late sleep so won't get up; mental - sanskars, vritti, locality of ref, etc. BV - lack of higher taste.
CS - IQ - Quality includes functional and non functional aspects like security, performance, load handling, benchmarking, exception handling, etc. Innovation and patents even in here.
Story - Jalandhar visit of chachaji - guru se badaa chela. 3 step jump. Relay race. zipline gulmarg. Map of india states, 90 degree triangle, slap him why, stone throw, kho kho, kabaddi winner.
	Jayadev Pr offended when chanted ignoring him but quickly forgave after behaved in nice ways. Devs are awesome.
	Womb to tomb planning - Prahlad school (teacing and campts), Youth (SMY and DYS is common), Girls; YOGA (1 time seminars); Congregation (Cultures and lotus voice); Old age (adavita sabha).

Story - Ladi uncle for social Erp - speak fast to elicit fast behavior. Chay piyoge asked to vendors. 500 inne jaye kamm da? Talking final rate in front of him loudly.
	Ask them what to do as if you would rather do it yourself but need assistance for sake of ease. We respect labor but know its value if I were to do it myself.
	Respect their labor but not blindly. So I am just paying for my own convenience and I value my doing it far more than delegating for a few bucks more.
Story - chunni in wedding I would keep in hand and won't let go. Girl should be on left she never was. Kept the chunni aside in the car and kept back only for pretension.
Story - Balram turban binding to kamar at runtime - had got this intuition. Hiranya fall on the head.
PIES - All Hinduphobic movies and series can be leveraged to support a sanatan dharma narrative.
Scrum - Mornings for SQ and Day for Home or office (prefer concrete but abstract VA also included in cladding or padding); Evenings for entertainments and social life - amusements included here.
	On weekdays - SQ and Science in mornings; Concrete V in day time with breaks; Abstract V and NIC+E based A in evenings (news[paper], Amuse, choose, etc)
	Books take you more deep than listening to someone. Listening takes you more wide and attuned to that frequency.
HomeErp - Marriage sources

		Online - dating, matri sites.
	Marriage paths - stranger -> Formal -> Friend -> Intimate.
SQ - Major is KC. Schools I have studied all. AT is like elephant and all world views are like blind men holding onto some aspects of reality. None are wrong but are limited.
Lesson of Movie Kabir Singh - being ziddi - do against us if you want but we will override it later anyway.
PersonalErp - Joking standup - Premise, POV (points of view), genre like inanimate objects feelings. Punchline.
SQ - best expression of anger against god isn't hate or breaking regs - these things only hurt you more but to ignore him.
	gotta standardize illusions also - escapism but you don't have to go all the way to break regs but just break the pattern.
	It's a sign of spiritual weakness if you can't take it.
PIES - all layers come with obligations and concerns - fulfilling them makes you an engr but being driven by interest and doing active plan making makes you an arch.
Scrum - Social layer - consumerism (exits in social frameworks), how businesses run. HomeErp - Home Concrete and MBA and Office KT. PersonalErp - ABCD psychology and IQ Study; also CS Life concretely.
SQ - no God comes to help you until you decide to help yourself. Anything you run after (Peeche pad jaate ho), that gets solved.
Story - Laptop stand injuring my nails cuz of bad physics. Spilling of tea on the bed.
Scrum - Spiritual and Science courses in the morning. Home and office in the daytime and early evening time with breaks for concrete personal VA. Social News and study at least once a week. Abstract personal for both VA b4 sleeping.
SQ - energy centers or channels
	Letter and sounds believed to have impacts on specific energy centers or energy channels.
	What about dance? Yes classical and disco - there is some difference - energy burst vs energy channelled to emotions and expressions. Similarly ESMD, etc.
	Superself
		Spirituality - dogmatic, judgmental, addicted; anger at divine, weak faith are all signs of imbalance too much or too little. Life of service!?
		Imagination and intuition (see what others can't - in time, in depth, in width, in trains of results - far sightedness) - architect.
		Communication, creativity, expressive (preach) - foundational - energy engagement in interpersonal behaviors.
	Self - Love compassion - soul - energy engagement in service.
	Subself
		Power determination (achieve) - energe engagement in intellect.
		Pleasures - energy engagement for SG - sexuality, pleasures (senses and mind)
		Existence - energy streaming stability stability - bare bottom needs (FCS or ESMD) - body
PIES Uncat
	don't be stateless - memory - best ESMD.
	To be arch - keep all UMLs besides DMPM in your cache - both abstract and concrete. And ability to discuss it - pros and cons.
	energy blast channelled to a field. by Yukta of ESMD. Akna Thakna Jhakna automatic.
	DFD drill down to context flow in the end.
	Problem of exits that our energy finds - channeling them is 2nd thing - 1st is having them. Practice of channel is also important - thru association and practice.
	Fat - extra reserves of energy not getting channelled.
		Skinny - body not in need of the energy. Not enough work.
		Balance of energy is one concern - thorough engagement is another. So depth and width both are required.
SAP - SocialErp - Going Nuts 
	Assorted almonds, walnuts, pistachios, cashewnuts, hazelnuts.

	UPI on PayTM, Amazon, BHIM - only suffixes change and username of your selection.
PIES - Fun is not in Abstract (it's more of preparation or foundational (config, standardization, health) stuffs).
	Scrum - Current phase was layer specific foundations - config and standardizations.
	Fun is in concrete jnana like KT or brainstorming - streaming to structuring in your head and seeing the application of abstract stuffs.
	Fun is also in concrete dhyan or karma - streamed actions or problem solving or doing transactions to a skyscraper building. Individual actions mastery is engg that's there - that's the master data - it's supposed to be already there.

	Independent Residence
		Bungalow, Villa, Lodge and Cottage are independent residences
		Bungalow - low single storeyed or 2nd floor on roof occasionally with wide porches, verandahs and sloping roofs with deep overhangs.
		Villas - country estates built by Romans. They were designed to be self sufficient, and were surrounded by buildings like outhouses, gardens, storage warehouses, and farmlands.
			Romans built these for leisures.
			Nowadays the term is loosely used to mean anything from semi-detached house to a luxurious home.
		Cottage - They were quaint, modest, cozy and practical homes in rural areas. tiled sloping roofs.
		Lodge - dwelling units for temporary occupation during the hunting.
	multiple residences on a plot
		Townhouses are houses which abut other houses by shared walls and are generally higher in density.
			Soon these became the only homes for people preferred to live in towns, close to their work place
			Rowhouses are similar, though smaller, with lesser number of floors and less luxurious than a townhouse.
		A Condo is an abbreviation of Condominium. A Condominium is basically multiple residences on a single plot of land (in many countries same as an apartment).
Story - Telangana dev who walked barefoot and shared his probs.

HomeErp - Room Heater - Fan, Heat, Power switch.
HomeErp - Socket short circuited and lights turned off
	cuz of too much voltage and got hot cuz of room heater

LIB - Spark Job Exploration - app deployed asking for spark service - earlier 2 clusters used across spaces but now spaces have unique clusters (?with same name spark and spark-perf?)
	app with I_no created a job on the cluster and then left - no graceful way to kill the job - except swagger spark api. That's the last resort.
	clusters are nothing to do with cf spaces - just handles or credentials to the spark clusters somewhere else.
	monitoring api lists spark jobs on spark clusters 2 clusters each of them but jobs have no overlap - of course, view of monitoring in every space is restricted to jobs spawned from their space.
	every spark cluster or kafka cluster is associated with a tenant not IOT tenant but SCP tenant. This spark job.
	spark job created but not started to save resources - start call -> even no valid tenant then also not started cuz why waste resource.
		it takes 3 minutes for start and stop of spark services.
	start spark job - this has to have a migrated tenant in first place - this came from jwt web page.
	spark job started cuz driver resources satisfied on 1 working node but it still kept waiting for resources for executors for cumulative hardware resources cuz not enough cores to distribute 
		executors to distribute the load - reduce executor core to 8 from 16 even if it's max and distributed 
		after patch call to spark jobs - asking for lesser executor resources.
	clean the performance space after all the work is done.
	feel free to approach senior colleagues - there's lots of grats and growth there.
	So, what's the view that Spark UI provides - is it space specific?
		No, it's a view of 1 of the clusters - multiple tenants subscribe to the same spark cluster. Observe the application context names on the UI - the tenants are different.
		So, lots of apps were given this spark service credentials when it asked for it. The credentials for a spark which were created against more than 1 SCP tenants.
		Every space uses same set of spark clusters with their own tenant guids. 
			Hence credentials generated for each application using the same tenant guid (that of the space).
			Observe that tenant is same for all jobs in monitoring app's - spark resources endpoint call. And tenants change across clusters and spaces.
		So, credentials distinguish between spaces for spark.
	aws canary is everything all our development spaces exist on the canary space.
	start the job and then read all jobs using the app thru the endpoint 
		this list excludes the spark jobs created by other apps like coldstore, derivations, etc (these show up in monitoring).
		All spark spawning apps get assigned same tenant hence credentials - the proof is monitoring call.
		observe context id against the spark jobs doesn't show - it will start showing after 3 minutes from start.
	different executors have different context ids for a job. 1 of them same as a generated job.
		opened 1 of them logs has reference of sandbox.
	URL is a cluster with a set of tenants subscribed to it - across spaces? yes - credentials already restrict tenants so restricted view for only those tenants - all sandbox etc not among those.
	Conclusion - spark cluster - different credentials for different spaces and ?(perhaps areas like IOT Core serices) - for 1 credentials view of a set of tenants is visible - all jobs created with those SPC tenants are visible - typically other spaces' spark UI credentials - show those tenants context ids but over here (spark UI with performance credentials), those sandbox context id or even tenants are not visible - meaning the view is for a set of tenants which are not used by those spaces.
	Use tenant - 3286116b-2e3e-416c-a8cb-db09e9c6584a. iotae-perfhdibd14 in JWT Web page.
LIB - What are we doing here - getting performance measurements how much response time, etc is taken by spark jobs in their processing from raw to processed topics.
	start a spark job for tenant of staging space. start and stop kafka topics for them. Abstract app spawns a job for us - that's all.
		in conf file - we ask for tenant to be tested - which spark job? which kafka topics and which space - where do we specify these details.
	Quality will also become round robin from next year. Not fair on those colleagues. All KT to get finished in this December.
CS - JAVA project with scala libraries is 1 thing - plugins will make repl accessible and help compile the scala files. But it remains a java project.

HomeErp - you should be proud of your partner. Guiding light to you.
	This is the most important thing in life - most of the people are dragging folks only - no1 knows why marry and why procreate.
	These are choices in the world - wife, friends, food, wake up - eth is choice and determine the outcomes. Nepolean Hills transmutation.
	In spite of all discriminations still it's a gambling - you never know which chocolate you get.
	Fillers for charge points - otherwise you keep working thru the day.

	problem was not enough resource on any worker node
	creating spark job with limited resources and still spark job performance test failed.
		perhaps because of the num_things being 500
		check with Abhishek Jain.
		Practically many problems show up - yes wo to hai.
		na samjh aaye kuch toh take help from Abhishek
	change the tenant to some staging space tenant
		poori config file change hogi
			system-conf property -> cf = ${target_spaces.perf}
			then tenant_id also.
		The job doesn't run in spaces nor does kafka so it doesn't matter. It's all about tenants when it comes to spark and kafka.
		configuration, abstractmodel-xx20.iotae here everything is pointing to perf space
		use endpoint for getting job id for tenant /api/v1/tenants/ingestion-job/<id>
			listed under abstract but migration ke time pe hybrid bolta tha - meaning registered with both the jobs.
    resource crunch ka bhi problem hai 
		next time I will delete the jobs. After clarifying of course.
	Tried changes maven repository resource after nexus local was not connecting cuz of VPN issue - but later continued using that.
Scrum - If you are not aggressive with your projects, then be ready to become part of other's plans or projects (of course in exchange of rewards) in both VA. Home politics or office politics come later - first problem is you gotta be aggressive with your projects without imposition.

	there is a spiritual tier - with Meditation, Yoga, Study and introspection and Scrum.
		is also office and home for some people and social consumption for others.
	Office is space for Varna - it's not home at all - it's arena of social service - others are engaged like you are in your current job and e1 is a part of the social ecosystem.
		ideally social news, abstract social study and social awareness are all intended in this time only (perhaps including weekend).
	The CRM exits in social framework (B2C) create a space for ashram called as Home. Home is like resting space of social consumptions for going back to social service space.
		ideally study of all tools and services consumed or planning to consume - all projects get created in this space 
		you should be able to answer 5 active user stories of the month. Eg - gotta shift my luggage, gotta 
	There is also a need for personal space where your skills are cultivated, psychology is studied and applied for evolution, communication, affirmations, etc. aka Me Time.

	completness, robustness, performance, etc are the concerns.
	archs talks are just explaining this permutation and combination only. Questions should be alternatives, correctness, completeness, etc.
	hear some seminar talks to understand how archs discussions looklike.
	wiki for ref completely.
	these concrete arch or concrete code walkthrough -> are nothing but PnC of abstract to serve the higher layer.
	Eg - use runner concept, thread concept language features to serve the concrete arch goal. so abstract mapped to concrete arch.
	similarly abstract archs mapped to functional goal is concrete arch.
	It needs concentration (or curiosity) to listen and thorough abstract knowledge to listen properly and structure the streamed information.
	social service is which layer? sp. Healthify app is which layer? A for physical space.
	Networking layers to get best outta KT - physical (data rate), IPs, Socket or ports, application layer.
	checkpointing of KT (sections that are clear and where the questions are needed)
	Every seminar presentation rather is a tree to be conveyed mostly or DAG of code but tree (DFD levels) mostly - where are we in the tree of KT so ppt rocks.
	From professional perspective we gotta master our layer's abstract (tools mastery) and concrete goals to be met (docs, wiki, git)
	To ensure mastery on a tool and concrete vision give a reverse KT at least to a camera.

CS - Spark - Batches never run together.
    as long as ingestion is slow the batch interval does not matter.
    spark will consume in a bigger bunch (assuming max.records is set aptly)
    on shutdown - there is a hook and all remainder batches will be finished b4 stop.
        checkpoint directory will maintain data if you force stop - restart will pick up.
        Delete the files if too much.
    if spark consumption max records per batch is barred then too big batch duration will make it slow.
    if batch duration is made much slower than processing - it will survive for some time and then memory issues will start showing.
    if ingestion rate is increased further, then higher batch duration can cause problem being bottlenecked by the max records else no problem.
    so best is to play somewhat (or even considerably) more than the average processing time until you know that max records per batch won't be a choke.
    Streaming tab starts after the streaming is started as awaitTermination and batches are processed.
IQGrats - Being validated by the senior colleague over the analysis of why a dedicated spark job was failed for the tenant.
    did it all end to end with only access to DB and code repo. Reference for local run.
    Build it - use local run configs with many shortcomings and correct them along the way.
    Make code changes to bypass the ssl needs, hana tunnel creation, bypassing the library thru direct call.
    Fetching the records from hana for a sample dataset creation.
    Code changes to override in order to escape what's outside of control but eventually finding its root cause.
PIES - Serious fun. Serious word makes it boring. And Only fun makes it foolish.
    Show the limitations of the other extreme and then start telling your ideal world.
    Eg - Then why work, go on dancing like jackass. There is fun in everything including books.
    I like to believe that beating someone in the name of fun isn't cool.
        The seriousness or sacredness of life has to be maintained.
    That's boring - what's the use of being "not boring", if I can't have a serious heart to heart talk with you.
    Fun is usually in the moment and it can be across layer of existence. Mostly preyas but has advantages of mindfulness.
        Seriousness is usually shreyas in the long run thinking and not being dissuaded by short term rewards.
        We need a life which has both short term entertainment without compromising our long term interests.
        We drive the car for a destination but enjoy the journey. Enjoying journey is fun but reaching destination is seriousness.
        Simplest answer to that claim is what's the use of sitting in 1st class apartment if the train does not reach destination.
        This statement captures the balance between shreyas and preyas aptly.
        Some believe reach destination even if stay miserable thru journey - that's not good.
        Some believe that enjoy the journey even if you reach a place that you didn't want - that's not good either.
        The balance wins.
IQ - Good quality of Ashok that he is always open to good ideas coming from anywhere to improve things.   
PIES - Most important
    About
        The real problem is that our goals are not high enough. We get whatever little goals we set.
        As a man thinketh, so learn to think high.
        We have to target goals that are in our reach or Circle of influence.
        We know that Spiritual world is highest prayojan (actually helping others in their perfection is still higher)
        This is COC and getting it is beyond our COI
        what's in our hand is tapasya for the same but we also wanna checkpoint our progress.
        So there are stages of perfection as per 4 high level ashrams that we should strive for
        this is mainly from avaroh pantha but relatable in aaroh pantha
            we will use all the guidance in avaroh and aaroh for the following goals.
            avaroh on other levels of perfection is application of same at smaller granularity tiers
            it's important to not get stuck at any particular but traverse thru it for perfection.
            aaroh can come from self help authors, experiences, successful idolizing, science, logical thinking, exploring social systems, etc.
    Prayojan - In terms of SVAF, the following - 
        I want personal perfection
            Eg - spirituality and Foundation in attitude - being virtuous in qualities, etc.
            being highly effective
            in Varna I can do it all, In ashram, I consume everything.
            Abstract Idols - always making yourself better, people with regulated lifestyle.
        I want group (team/family) perfection
            Eg - spirituality and foundation in behavior - behavioral qualities and examplification.
            being great contributor
            in Varna we can do it all, In ashram, we consume it all.
            concerned with great coordinations in interest of some social goodness (but not specific best social interest)
                there are also impedance or resistance but those specific problems are just jnana and dhyan based problem solving.
            Abstract Idols - all awesome people around you (focus on positives of e1 around you)
        I want social perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in communication - being a spiritual or principles expert (or idol) and guiding so.
            dedicated to social welfare
            in varna, all of us do it all; In ashram, all of us consume it well as a culture.
            Abstract Idols - All great men of the past - the people who left legacy by the purpose which was bigger than themselves.
        I want universal perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in Devotion - becoming one with spirituality and principles.
            this is mystic and esoteric side of perfection
            In Varna - we align well to trans in work; In ashram - we align well to trans in enjoyment.
            Abstract Idols - acaryas, sages, God and avatars.
    Abhidhyeya
        About - There are initial loads for all of them called BY, JY, DY, KY.
            all of the following are meant to be invested in 4 tier interests
            with special focus on 1 as per your stage.
        B - becoming 7 thru association.
            initial load - BY - become like sages, become like Krishna (thru stages)
            anartha nivritti phase is to emphasize avoid those what I don't wanna be like
                or distractions from what I wanna be like.
            aaroh - visualizations, affirmations, etc.
        J - knowledge cultivation from aaroh and avaroh sources with plan of application.
            initial load - knowledge cultivation, even repetition, spending time to rethink stories (shravanam mananam)
            aaroh - self helps, researches.
        D - ability to focus on object and to decide what's worthy of focussing 
            Initial Load - vichar, dharan, power of enquiry; ashtang.
            aaroh - long sessions of quality meditation or deliberation.
        K - scrum life for increased seva.
            aaroh - self management.
PIES - release - just express yourself.
    It's the same energy which when focussed and channelled properly shows itself as exquisite power.
    self confidence - what you know no1 else does.
    Eg - Gyani Zial Singh speech career - think of audience as kaddu.
    Eg - Papa - what you know about your PhD they don't know even a dime about.
IQGrats - Size of my spark job consuming existing shaded spark jar was almost double the size. Why? cuz provided scope not given so both in classes and in jar.
    GIT code only for reusability - the size of the spark job is your responsibility and no1 else's.
IQ - There is lots of reduction involved while working - there are so many ways something would work.
    if you want a specific way to work - then by contrasting with what works in scalable way, taking delte, etc
    reduce the problem to specific - and then check online or ask 7, etc.
    Work like a scientist - ability to explain away everything or reduce problem to its subproblems to be solved.
Sume - paytm vs Greyscale
    About - No matter what the decision - every action or choice will create a very unique destiny.
    Compensation of Greyscale is 1L + RSUs more.
    Spirituality
        use case is proned towards some 4 regs breaking - meat eating and intoxication.
    Proven and established vs its future in jeopardy.
    Coolest tech in DIP (OpenCV + full stack) vs Cool tech with spark, kafka, etc.
        probability of working on openCV and CNN is a little lesser cuz there will be a separate lab in future.
    Next work estimate - data engg and ML specialization, back to software with architectural knowledge 
        vs DIP on resume, software demand, entry into silicon valley.
    Smart associations - smart experienced people with greyscale; smart colleagues in paytm.
    Risk or Danger - instablity of startup, need for high passion (work always) vs knowledge hunt mindset.
        high expectations of experienced people
        need for concrete upskill for practically everything OpenCV, Backend, frontend, etc besides doing cool stuffs.
        Even if you want to see the startup culture it is better to see it gradually than abruptly.
    Brand Value - Paytm has higher brand value being established though not MNC.
    who has higher P(Reward)/P(Risk) ratio in general
        and also who has higher P(Reward)/P(Risk) ratio specifically - taking my beliefs and value system into consideration.
    Next, who has better contingency plan in case of risk facing.
        gap in past looks bad and anything that undermines my talents should be avoided.
        preferably cool brands on my resume that showcase my talent.
    Next, Which techs have greater demand/Supply ratio generally
        and also specifically considering my already expertise or cultivate-able expertise given my nature.
PIES - Group yoga to social yoga.
    In Group yoga phase, try to work with coolest of people for coolest of the things
        grow you capability as a team player.
        try to pick a work that doesn't violate the upcoming yoga tiers - like social or spiritual yoga.
        The case in point is just try - with fire there is smoke also and we try to minimize smoke but can't avoid it.
    Later in social yoga, it's more about working for social overall wellness or social well being (from sp perspective)
        or Ram Rajya (whether with or without Ram).
        the pursuit of action that will make 
PIES - this is layered karma.
    For a decision based on spiritual criteria - you may get a benefit of spiritual destiny but don't expect anything on lower layers.
    Every decision will have systematic results at separate layers as per the laws of nature, jiva and ishwar.
    Many make spiritual decision, expecting material favors - it does not work that way.
    So it is your responsibility to do justice to your psyche in the marathon of life.
    You know what the layered shreyas is and every decision creates destiny in terms of the tuple of all the layers of existence.
    So choices matter - cuz every choice is a destiny in terms of tuple of layers of existence.
    Some choices project very charming prospects of 1 element of the tuple or a dimension but at the expense of others.
    shreyas hierarchy - Ishwar, srishti, groups, individual.
        VA is also a path to transcendence - you are at a certain level of evolution.
        At every tier - the yoga is about oneness - in purpose and in grats.
        But while looking for maximizing yoga of 1 tier - make sure you ain't compromise (not necessarily maximizing) a higher tier (or shreyas)

PIES - Stagifying our perfection to Krishna.
    For group yoga, personal yoga is assumed. Similarly with social yoga.
    benchmarks are high so we have to have sprint review every weekend to get the status report.
    Group yoga means I have become the group - honesty to tell flaw when it's there. Feeling good and bad wrt group.
        Why am I not sensitive to my home group - cuz I don't identify myself very strongly with that group - forget becoming 1 with it or being it.
    You go to Krishna after you become 1 with Krishna - it's not that easy - gradual evolution is thru tiers approach.
    With sadhana 1 can even bypass the tiers tracking but that's not the ideal way to go.
PIES - Mature growth is gradual.
    In KC we have summom bonum, the essence of all essence.
    But life is a journey to reach and live by that essence gradually with maturity.
    The desirable thing is to not deny it like stupid 
    but realize your fortune and align to the ultimate goal while respecting the stages of growth.
SQ - Karmic reactions are not the only principle - there are also law of attraction, strong desire of someone, and influence of kala.
CS - RDBMS
    t| Employee(t) and t.fName = "John"
    s.t, exists in table, dot operator, exists, For all, logical and or.
    Algebra
        set operation - UNION, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE (MINUS), cartesian
        relational operations - selection(SIG), projection (PI), join (|X|), set division (/).
        set functions - min, max, any, count, sum, avg.
        PI(SNAME)((SIG(PID=3))SP)
    Relational calculus to get requirements from query.
        Relational algebra to sequence operations for every instance.
        syntax mapping from there.
    PI(S.movieTitle, M.studioName)SIG(movieYear>=2000)(Stars X Movie)
    Q - select capability with all these specified properties.
        IN can be converted into EXISTS by moving where clause inside exists.
        OR can be converted into UNION by rewriting the previous query with where clause added.
    SQL Engine
        SQL
        Translation to RA (logical query plan)
        Plan optimization (optimized logical query plan)
        physical plan selection (along with stats and metadata)
        execution engine (refer physical data storage)
        result
    UNION - 
        JOIN as bad alternative.
        scalar subquery - replace projection clause with another select clauses from dual.
    INTERSECT - 
        IN or JOINS.
    MINUS - NOT IN.
    IN vs DISTINCT JOIN - no difference on unique index columns; otherwise IN performs better cuz of using hashes.
        EXISTS is more flexible but more prone to inefficiency.
    select * from bodyInput
Sume - IQ Bhakti - No problem even if I won't make a consuming application of spark-service-connection library but I did so that the consumer will have no difficulty.
    No problem if I let go off the Hilti thing job instability reasons but I finished it and shared my findings which he ack b4 taking up further causes.
PIES - Be like NodeJS while working, ERP, Big Data Batch, Big Data Streaming, Jenkins pipeline. From siemens also there can be something.

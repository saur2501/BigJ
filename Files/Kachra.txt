EQ - I should love not only family, but also friends and relatives, next I should love my city, state, country and world (meaning people in there).
    This is what ashram entails as its goal.
CS
    If you don't use @Lazy, the framework creates a singleton bean at the application startup and makes sure that the same instance is autowired and reused in all other dependent beans
    REST Controller is multithreaded - It is not the case that the controller will block all subsequent calls while busy. It is multithreaded.
        REST controller is multithreaded as the DisptcherServlet handles multiple requests from the clients concurrently and serves using the respective controller methods.
        Your controller is a singleton by default and your service is singleton by default too.
        So, to make them thread safe - make sure that the operations that take place inside the service must be thread safe
        Use @transactional annotation in spring or implement it yourself.
        We can test this thru a variable increment - have a class with a variable able to take 3 values.
            Let the returned value increment over every call.
    Thread safe - lots of threads in a process will traverse thru a given object (class instance) methods.
        A class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads,
        regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of those threads by the runtime environment,
        and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of the calling code.
    Web App - starts with premise of n threads for n requests
        but nothing shared across threads except singleton objects and static class members - variables and methods of the class.
        All threads have different class instances to run on without a problem - nth shared but when threads work on anything shared - then there are potential problems.
        like shared class members or singleton class or classes with limited instances - then you have the problem of thread safety.
        Think of it this way - lots of threads are coming thru Our controller class. Any state information can easily be wronged.
    Rest controllers don't run 1 after the other - although controller instance is shared - all threads run it simultaneously
        so at any given time we can have n threads running thru the singleton controller.
CS - Arch - make 1 straight forward transactional DFD story and then think alternatives.
IDEA - Derivations and discussions. Also delivered in LIB so qualifies for sume.
    Create a transformation matrix for the TSS vector. Any product is also yet another transformational matrix. But convenient for the user.
        chaining of the rules is output becomes input for the other.
        This is being realized thru nested rules - rule that has rule as a function. Good idea. Called rule orchestration.on
        windowing - for sliding average - can think of implementing it in terms of sequences of previous one itself.
            but the problem of late comers. Integral as a solution. I would like to have it but how to explain to the users but gotta explain - not easy to sell.
        Transformation problem solution is quite a work.
            introduce 2 spark jobs - error recognition, outlier recog, and correction, UoM transformations.
            expensive to break everything around monitoring and data ingestion pipeline. Any idea to do it quicker.
            We lose many customers cuz we don't have these basic capabilities.
    Sequential circuits vs combinatorial circuits - when output becomes the input for the same or the other circuit.
        Sequential circuits - can realize polynomial functions of higher order.
        Not that design time team has to do it - even we can do it from inside our spark job - this can be proposed or implemented when time comes.
        @who needs it from hardware when software can do it.
CS - Refactoring
    Doesn't matter lines of code (5-15 is a helpful indicator through). method should do one thing and only one thing.
    Indicators that this is not the case -
        More than one level of indention in a method
        Paragraph Breaks - whitespaces between logical statements.
    fit on screen is very good - imagine if you have to gives reasons to a lawyer.
PIES - Foundation - It is about well being. Divided into 4 as follows
    Attitude - Internal or mental well being. Mental States - personal psyche.
        Can stretch this to include external conduct in personal space.
    Behavior - Well being with respect external conduct (personally or socially) - eg driving car, polity, etc. Social psyche (or personal well being in society)
    Communication - Well being thru Interactions or exchanges. Networking - micro-economics and fun
    Devotion - Well being thru being purpose centric. Scrum. Effectiveness or IQ Motivation.
    Conclusion - Psychology, economics and Motivation is at the heart of this.
        but also social studies for behaviors eg but that can always be studied under ashram.
EQ - Economics
    Price increase does not change demand (only demanded quantity). In economic terms, demand is a reference to how useful a good is to the customer.
    in economics, if they say “demand increases” it means people are willing to pay more for it.
    True demand has it’s root in fundamental human desire, not in economics. It’s a subjective measure of how important a good or service is to a person relative to other goods and services.
    So when we say demand increases, we are suggesting people have changed their view of what is important to them and they want more of a product than they did in the past.
    if ice were simply to become a far more popular product for people to buy, then the companies producing and selling ice might be able to produce it for less, due to economies of scale
    So in general, increased demand increases price when supply kept constant but if supply can be increased then economics of scale takes over.
    Similarly, lower demand, lower cost.
    Higher prices mean less demand. But High demand raises the prices.
    1 ice-creaming then bidding so price shoots. 100 icecream, price drops cuz you have replacements.
    Higher price (than value), you reduce the intake thus demand; lower price, then you over use it.
    So, price is just in middle and price and demand keep affecting and stabilizing each other along with supply.
    There's demand so there's price. Price rising, then demand reduces so you can't increase it too much.
    Study it as human behavior with respect to price in terms of supply and demand. The price is too low, people will desire it more.
        another study, market behavior of price, with respect to demand and supply. You know that people value this, you can rate it high.

IQ - Presentation
    Organize your content.
        Theory and Practical should intersperse - practical really spices things up.
        specification, then end user presentation, architecture, code review.
    Practice 3 times b4 your presentation.
CS - Mac hierarchy - Good UXD.
    Apple icon -> list -> icons -> tabs -> list columns hierarchy -> individual controls / Demo video.

IQ - Lessons from College Alumnus senior Abhijeet of SAP who left for Intuit
    US Finance for tax filing - books maintain - us finance - real time transactions to be streamlined - kubernetes, apache kafka,streaming real time, it's not there yet
    it could batch - schedule they do - as much as manager said - that has to be real time.
    4.5 years now so have to see new - Any time no learning it's time to switch within or outside.
    do as much in 40 years - do as much good as possible by that time.
    Stable position by 40 years - monetary value and designation - it gets dangerous with time. Like pandemic.
    stable - work and money. You are young - design item pick.
    Brain you have - design item uthao - crowd - only few people are good - Ajay is good (a lot to learn from, can offer helps), kanu is good, ok, Imran is good.
    Baaki sabki dukan chal rahi hai. Tune dukaan nahi chalani - seekh karke nikalna hai. Grow more. Learn and grow - repeat.
    Get good work - this is old and deprecated. Old home work and then pick new work.
    New tools and learning but money is less - that disturbs.
    Less money should inspiration for work. People still can give you more money for work - but you gotta see both work and money.
        not step out just like that - money more and work also good.
        Know good work then good money not vv. Basics strong and then go out - lots of money in market.
        Private company this is the advantage it's not govt company.
        No deception here - learn till you know everything - what you do - ppl or can close eyes and tell it all. I know in and out - he knows business - he should be able to say.
        Less money will give you inspiration that I need to improve and get better.
        This is beginning - pick work then learning and responsibility comes naturally - if you keep sitting, that's what you end up with.
        More work you pick, more you are pushed forward.
        Work pickers are little less - pick a bcp and take help from others.
        BCP solving then you will understand the product - Ask ajay he will help - but need to go to him with knowledge - to ask him about M, you already need to know A to L.
        Accha sa Kaam utha - design kar, interest automatically aa jayega.
        coming from good place and have learnt so much that others won't know - so implement more than others - give suggestion.
        Behind the curtain won't give anything - Come ahead and speak - it's our team only. Speak out and you know so much that here people don't 
            not so much about showcasing yourself than giving really good suggestion.
            But b4 suggestion, read something about product - if that's feasible not selling knowledge - speaking anything without even knowing the product.
            wiki documents - product exploration - sap help document gives business knowledge.
            Ingestion pipeline - scala streaming code - no rocket science - only take input source is different from output.
            so take input from device. Output is time series. Spark streaming written for that. Cache written - transforms and gives something else. That's all.
            Know some spark and kafka - write some spark streaming app - then Confidence that I know things.
            Architectural understanding - product understanding and product programming then architecture is automatic.
        State spec - spark streaming lecture - it's a hashmap. Any language to learn is see its documentation.
            if keywords then you don't get anywhere - it's simple cache. If you hold onto something then you won't get it.
            Lectures see - conference, summits gotta see - some old ones really good. Faruki's is good.
            Some small product you should make in weekends - read spark like a guy came who didn't now spark earlier - he learnt - picked data from open source.
            and did streamlining on aadhar card and stored in redis - automatically understanding comes - for your own learning.
            don't think it is company's work - company's work is project. Technology is OSS and that is another project. Office we just more.
            But learning tech is first thing and then comes product.
        You need to look up to 7 - And I am not going till that date and there are many more people to look up to. take my number. Anyways from the same college.
    Hike is good 50% and your level it will be far more - market is not bad - market is good and they pay a lot.

CS - you can install cf thru brew, cf binaries, windows installer, etc.
IDEA - Instead of DoD checking status in 10 places - let's have an app or integrate with monitoring - which checks availability across apps in scheduled manner and returns error with which all failed.
    what about failed in past - kibana logs - ideally 500 response from any app can be configured to inform on slack / email or raise IOT alarms.
    But suggesting may reduce our DoD efforts and hence manpower. 2nd, this must have already been thought before. Third, building it means not focussin on our own IOT core work.

    You think you deserve Krishna. What do you understand about Krishna - what would you know of his value.
    //Somehow last statement got blurted out loud in front of all.
    What's his value - Ask them - they say - He is worth sacrificing everything.
    1 yogi said - he was worth all the penance; who got a glimpse of him after 1000s of years of penance.
    Ask devotees [like SP] who would not mind undergoing severe pains even if it leads to failing for his cause.
    Ask devotees who laid down their lives as it was a flower to offer in face of protecting other devotees of Krishna.
    Ask devotees who have given all their time, money, effort to Krishna's cause.
    Ask those who would wait 1 million years, if that's what it takes to see him again.
    Ask those who would beg to be an insect or dog in his servant's house to serve.
    Ask the gods who beg to be a grass to be trampled upon by his devotees.
    Ask seekers who sacrifice everything in his exploration to find his traces.
    Ask servers who work for him without any demand for personal remuneration.

PIES
    YOLO pinnacle is social validation like being a celeb for something.
    It has to be across the layers otherwise it will be shallow.
    The validation is goal when we are talking YOLO life but in face of legacy, validation is a utility only.
    Stabilization in SVAF means finding a niche where you become celebrity or get huge social validations along with worldy rewards and power.
    In SVAF world, you are a leader. People are leaders like being parents, being political leaders, etc.
    PIES Engineering should already get you to personal level SVAF or achieving ego gratifications on personal front. Social recognition would be good add-on, if possible.
    This social validation comes in different grain and 3 levels (CNI - Concern Need Interest - FDDL)
        You are helpful (not awkward or disturbance) - F or C.
        You are recognized as a menber contributor (accepted as one of us) - D or N.
        You are celebrated (celeb) - This should be our target - D or I.
        //Your love for craft is visible - L as fuel.
SQ - We are really fortunate that we got Krishna's grace in all the environment since birth that takes us out of MOI and MOP infatuations - anarthas.
PIES - I am NodeJS. Asynchronous threads - keep the context so as to return to them with all details when necessary. Time saved for something more useful.
SQ - why don't I just accept people the way they are - we really don't need photocopies of people.
    We need a variety of people and we should celebrate variety and difference of opinion instead of opening.
    How can we respect people in all MMN - we accept tiger for eating meat and don't kill it for its natural behavior.
    But still that does not mean that we accept that as their right - human does not have right to kill another - human or animal
        but factually nature permits jiva to act in those ways (only rules may stop them) and then sets its tracks thru karma.
        So, for beyond life is taken care but within life, some behaviors are not desirable - so we have rule system - so that we as a community lives happily to whatever extent possible.
    But humans can control themselves - it is rather our responsibility to enlighten them and if they still continue that's their free will. Isn't it?
    We can respect MOP for their dedication even if it's for grats. Respect MOI for their humanity and empathy.
    respect MOG for paying the price for alignment. Respect trans for their visions and goals.
    1 problem in past was that people in MOG hated MOI people which are so innocent - they deserved to be helped than hated. But that hatred has a recoil. That's what at least history teaches us.
    But that's 1 showcased problem - what about MOP hating MOI - kings or leadership roles exploiting the innocent labors - all the same.
    In KC, we rise about this MMN hatred. Of course, if some MMN disturbs us, we can distance ourselves while maintaining respect - like MOP is still aligned to VA norms anyways.
SQ - Asura != MOP. Asura means exclusion of spiritual awareness - such a person can be in all MMN like MOG, MOP, MOI.
    Similarly spiritually aware person can also be in MMN until he evolves enough.
PIES - I have paid the goddamn price of MOG - people striving for enmity which you refuse. etc.
    You are manipulated into acting in a certain way - but I believe in acting in that way - don't refuse only cuz you are aware of it and refuse to accept manipulation.
    Doing dharma even if it triggers different feelings.
PIES - IF the basis of marriage is avoiding problems then it's MOI; it's its only enjoyment then MOP, etc.
    So, what should the criteria be - Godhead, Legacy and YOLO.
    Godhead perspective - I gotta get a god conscious lady or better stay focussed.
        Association is the key here - not 1 person but n people.
    Legacy perspective - Think and grow rich - either be brahmacari or find a cooperative partner (also helpful in home ishta goshti)
        Here there can be allies and frieds - life partner can be a potentially great add on.
    YOLO perspective - I need a lady who clusters with you - relate both wanna see anime or stuff.
        Being complementary with each other is a great add on. 1's weakness is solved by another's strength.
        Also, there's so much fun these days outside in consumerism that the impedance mismatch can be escaped.
SQ - Org rule - that is in question - should we question - why not. There must be reasons and leave that - no, we want to know the reasons. Why not but still the ones in management still reserve the right. And we reserve the right to question it.
    Allegation - it is fanaticism - let's first sincerely analyse if that's true - or how true does this statement is. Can that be justified. let's define fanaticism - religious niyam aagrah 
        Forgetting essence of rule you may make bad judgments - that is true.
        Problem is with religious fervor - personally that's great but imposition on others, that's beyond your right. And this is actually the different study - where religion merges with kshatriya rule.
        Problem with religion dominating the rule or the power - kshatriya - nothing wrong as long as it is shreyas. In fact, desirable.
            But imposition - that's problem beyond religion - power is all about controlling others. We can't deny that - what we dislike is controlling against their will.
            In this case, this imposition is not even against their will. But what if sb wants to see - then it's bad control - that's the precise problem here.
        Fanaticism problem precisely is what religious texts which when taken to power, controls people in ways that they dislike - which is also true with all fields but religious fanaticism is that.
            so this statement makes some sense. But it may not necessarily be religious fanaticism - it could be just fanaticism only - of some other flavor - like personal bias or political bias, etc.
            Now, temple management will have to control in larger self interest so that will sometimes involve rules which are dislike-able to some.
    Go talk to them - we are not their spokesperson. It's an org decision.
PIES - Varna - we cluster on basis of fewer characteristics so huge radial distance. But formalizations will make it easy to interact or navigate thru to interesting places.
    Ashram we cluster on more dimension but impedence mismatch is gonna be a reality anyways and proximity does expose the differences at times being informal and gives pain. But purpose centric then see beyond differences to interesting places.
    Religious or doctrine or philosophical differences is 1 thing. What about differences within religion about practices and even philosophy - how long will ppl suffer cuz of ignorance of the reality of impedance mismatch.
    Foudational differences also exist - in sheer values you believe, behavioral modes (straight vs manipulated), communication languages (in different modes), Devotion conflicts (ideologies).
    So impedance mismatch is a fact - let's see beyond differences to what we want.
    MOI avoids the impedance which is so natural and sth to empathize with but not the best move (although this line of reasoning may be unnecessary given that it's anyways not pop) but still e1 needs to answer himself as well.
        Impedance can be overcome thru proper management.
        There is fun in overcoming the impedance that shows up or does not even show up cuz of good management.
        There are rewards and power in the clustering in spite of impedance.
        Many a times we can escape conflicts thru non-confrontation and unwillingness as if boring.
            in varna, that's recommended to not touch religion and politics - and that could be true in ashram realm also many a times.
            Like saying - This is so boring - it's simple - do if you like; leave if you don't. Why conflict.
PIES - SVAF as world thinks of it - All these terms may be unpopular among people of little knowledge - they oppose certain bad stories or maybe just following along pop culture (blindly - but let's not say it) - what they really need is clarity.
    In our presentations we don't wanna fight or confront - rather reason it as if convincing ourselves - others doubts become our doubts and we gotta share how we look at it. That's all.
    What if doubt triggers a bad reaction in us. Yes, it can and that's a danger of preaching but JY means we are open (in both aaroh and avaroh ways without mix up between the 2 of them) to ideas and interpretations.
    Best attack on avaroh is proving vedas paurusheya - human origin.
EQ - World polity (yes, it's not religion) - People who blindly talk about ideal world that all religions are happy together.
    1st thing who will not want that? But this statement is so shallow from depths of reality that they don't know the heat of friction that people have endured.
    We can't wish them away - these are complicated problems with many standardizations to stabilize the situation - and now breaking those standardizations is foolish if you don't know the backdrop.
    Although the intent is good, but it suffers ignorance of reality.
    Yes, generations may forget the frictions and may cast down the walls - and if the friction points are actually gone by then, then great else they can have devastating effect again.
Logs - Story - I told her - if you think it is going fast - we can take time and then proceed instead of acting in haste. 
    I told my sister - being trained in spirituality, my concepts are very clear - that differences are bound to be there. But gotta marry anyways.
    So from my end I was accomodating and circumstances were arranged in favor of giving me exits to act in favorable ways.
    So if I did my exits aptly then whatever framework brings outside of my scope has to be accepted as karma.

PIES - Manipulations isn't restricted to MOP. All MMN may involve manipulation 
    In MOI - it is intended to escape; In MOP, it is intended for power or money or position or distinction or enjoyment; In MOG it is intended towards other's well being or alignment or 1's own.
    In Trans, it is alignment with the trans - ur own or others' - so yes manipulating them in their interest and not even scandalous in the means to a justified end but even justified means.
SQ - to realize that as sender or receiver we are just exchanging suggestions and not controlling each other.
    Social ideology is bound to be important to people. Problem is with clash - a glass which some people want to be half full, some full, some want it to contain milk, etc.
    Solution is proper discussion to resolve or make more glasses accessible in parallel. OR Let the one in power worry about that and you focus on your things.
    In Manipulation, don't just think of ourselves as a prey but also as a predator - we need a sword and we need a dhaal.

    2nd phase - when you map an issue, with what you know and have specific queries from colleagues to solve it and confirm your solution.
    3rd phase - when you only confirm with older colleagues but solve it all by yourself.
    4th phase - when you extend help to others.
IQ
    Working for company - I am a partner with company and I give favors to the company so that they can do some service that I don't concern with.
    Working in company - I am a member of concern which renders some service. I am a part of a whole which serves.
    Working with company - I am independent entity which works in collaboration with the company to render a service which is our common goal.
    The best mood I think is working with company - that gives you passion for a service and company assists you in doing that just as you assist company.
    That company is your ally - it is always about your personal value and if your partners are big that you work with 
        that increaases your value as well along with rate of increase of value with time.
CS - Before, test, asserEqual, Fake, Mock, Stub.
    Stub - an object that provides predefined answers to method calls.
    Mock - an object on which you set expectations.
    Fake - an object with limited capabilities (for the purposes of testing), e.g. a fake web service. ...
        But informally, you'll often hear people simply call them mocks.
        working implementations, but not same as production one. Usually they take some shortcut and have simplified version of production code.

PIES
    All SVAF - created, maintained and Deleted - with tapa and on basis of satya.
    Varna - recruitment based on satya. I am in company cuz I contribute. I will properly wind up when necessary. So with other PIES.
    Ashram satya - that I don't just show care - I show it cuz I care it and ain't fool to not show if I have it.
    1 thing that I work hard to give desirable outcomes to my partners and even the means are very pleasurable.
    I don't forget means in pursuit of goal or vv. Balance of enjoying goal and the means.
PIES - we can fight over practically everything - cuz it is all about balance - no matter what 1 says - there can be a counter argument for it for fact.
    So we don't want to keep arguing over trifles but always thru discussion find a healthy balance for ourselves.
    So every discussion should be intended to guide us in some positive direction.
PIES - Fearlessness
    Fear is for the future - that desirable should come in required amount and undesirable should not come - this is bad expectations cuz undesirable helps us just as desirable.
    Fear is felt more in MOP cuz attached to grats streaming and life feels futile without it. So MOG is the mantra.
    Fear is great power cuz it incentivises the regulated desirable behavior - at least for things that are under our control. Circle of influence => responsibility.
    For the things that are not in out control, why don't we just accept that there are things beyond our control (Circle of Concern) - called karma.
    Of course we can decide how to respond and plan around them just like exception handling.
        Clear expectations and what to do when expectations are not met - we don't paralyse bad with a runtime exception but handle them gracefully.
    Spirituality can help a great deal by 
        regulating the value of material realm
        seeing the bigger picture (higher abstractions of life)
        Declaring dependence.
        Realizing one's position as tenant and attachments in MOP and false identifications.
        tattva view
        karma, mind control, value reset, etc.
    without transcendence also.
        no fear cuz the life should be worth living think freedom fighters, think army men, etc.
            Life deserves to be respected and nobody has right to undermine it.
            What is the life which only worked hard like donkey and died one day - heck didn't even enjoy the world.
        It is about the life you believe in - and paying the price of whatever comes our way to live it should be paid.
            if you fear wrong choice and resulting undesirable price 
            plz understand every decision steps from current state of being and it is the being which deserves correction not actions alone.
            So, still mistakes should be welcome.
        Problems are meant to be faced and not avoided.
            If you don't know how to deal with them - the problem is precisely this and not in mistake and that too from external (@ CS - dependencies or external services - mockito in mind)

CS
    C - Consistency means a client should get same view of data at a given point in time irrespective of node it is looked up from.
    A - Availability here means that any given request should receive a response [success/failure].
    P - Partition Tolerance means the system remains operational despite node or other hardware failures, the system is tolerant enough to these kind of failures.
    CAP - Same data view to all clients; Each client can always read and write; system works despite physical failures (network or node)
    Consistency:
    Consistency says , every read receives the most recent write or an error.
    Availability:
    Availability says, every request receives a (non-error) response – without guarantee that it contains the most recent write,
    Partition Tolerance:
    Partition Tolerance says, the system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
    Distributed systems statisfy any two terms only and not satisfy three terms.
    CP – Consistency/Partition Tolerance
    AP – Availability/Partition Tolerance
    CA – Consistency/Availability
    Eg - Cassandra - always operations but when paritioned, still available for read and write but not consistent - latest write reflected from any node - not necessary but delayed after partition reconnects.
        Read can't guarantee the best or latest but write and read always successful even when partitioned. Good for time series.
    Eg - HBase - always operational but when partitioned, still consistent - any node reading or writing will give latest timestamp but not available - if, need to write to a replica node on different partition - refusal.
        or even reading may fail if data replica on partitioned node. connection failure exception or will it keep trying. Well, it is operational but won't allow an inconsistency. So write fail but read success message.
        When partitioned, On reading you have best or latest result always. On writing, it may refuse after many retries cuz replica node may not be available or approachable.
    Eg - RDBMS - if partition happens, it will just stop working - consistent and available for all operations otherwise. No response from a node - only busy wait.
        When partitioned, it just doesn't function anymore - reading or writing request - not allowed cuz nodes not avaiable - can't write inconsistent data to n-1 replica. For reading, if replica is available then return response else exception.
    Difference between RDBMS and CP systems like Redis and HBase when partition happens.
        RDBMS stop to operate - no longer read and write possible - to some degree it could be possible if approach read and writes - every node must have metadata about other node's data - that's not true.
        Redis - will guarantee best latest read (if any approachable replica), for write if partitioned replica then fail else allow.
        the 3rd one cassandra will allow all read and writes with no guarantee of latest TS ever.
        Using Quorum, some degree of handling parition is possible that's in cassandra.
    Distributed game is play of CP or AP - either make system function with some inconsistency allowed or refuse R/W sometimes with best results always.
        Only CA is not in the game of distributed, that's centralized system.
        Strictly speaking RDBMS is just an implementation which is not made with distributed tolerance in mind.
        MySQL can be CP if configured so.
        RDBMS avoids partition not tolerates or functions despite it - it just removes unapproachable nodes so avoiding it.
    Master slave model for CA systems, Hash ring for AP systems, etc.
    Best answer - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36404765/why-isnt-rdbms-partition-tolerant-in-cap-theorem-and-why-is-it-available
    CP - master slave - if full state replica on all nodes - then Q will get A for reading.
        but write will definitely refuse cuz of partition. Partial state replica and that too not on all nodes then it's more robust.
    AP - Every Q has a A on read but for write, there will be delta getting created.
        follow master re-election or masterless like cassandra.
    CA - Every Q has A but nodes that fail are removed to cope so avoiding the partition here.
        read and writes can go on at the expense of nodes removal. That's with full replica.
        for partial replica, that's not done. Let's say country wise separation of data, then system won't work anymore if say India data unapproachable for the query.
        If full replica, network partition happens - all unapproachable nodes are removed for read and write.
    AP - always available. Keep reading and writing - just with a consistency compromise.
    CP - read from anyone but write will be restricted. More robust if partial replica.
    https://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/
        A - For Q, A is guaranteed - no response like "500 bees in my eyes"
        C - 1 state in the distributed system - no ambiguity.
            requests of the distributed shared memory to act as if they were executing on a single node
            standard database replication is not strongly consistent but special logic to handle replication lag.
        partition tolerance, the network will be allowed to lose arbitrarily many messages sent from one node to another
            monolithic Oracle server with no replication can't be partitioned.
            practically speaking - add remote clients and you are on distributed.
        reads work all the times for all CAP but writes there is a difference in stand - allow or not allow.
            assuming writing power with all the nodes - or re-election of master to write in partition else without master, no write possible anyways.

CS - Spark - Batches never run together.
    as long as ingestion is slow the batch interval does not matter.
    spark will consume in a bigger bunch (assuming max.records is set aptly)
    on shutdown - there is a hook and all remainder batches will be finished b4 stop.
        checkpoint directory will maintain data if you force stop - restart will pick up.
        Delete the files if too much.
    if spark consumption max records per batch is barred then too big batch duration will make it slow.
    if batch duration is made much slower than processing - it will survive for some time and then memory issues will start showing.
    if ingestion rate is increased further, then higher batch duration can cause problem being bottlenecked by the max records else no problem.
    so best is to play somewhat (or even considerably) more than the average processing time until you know that max records per batch won't be a choke.
    Streaming tab starts after the streaming is started as awaitTermination and batches are processed.
IQGrats - Being validated by the senior colleague over the analysis of why a dedicated spark job was failed for the tenant.
    did it all end to end with only access to DB and code repo. Reference for local run.
    Build it - use local run configs with many shortcomings and correct them along the way.
    Make code changes to bypass the ssl needs, hana tunnel creation, bypassing the library thru direct call.
    Fetching the records from hana for a sample dataset creation.
    Code changes to override in order to escape what's outside of control but eventually finding its root cause.
PIES - Serious fun. Serious word makes it boring. And Only fun makes it foolish.
    Show the limitations of the other extreme and then start telling your ideal world.
    Eg - Then why work, go on dancing like jackass. There is fun in everything including books.
    I like to believe that beating someone in the name of fun isn't cool.
        The seriousness or sacredness of life has to be maintained.
    That's boring - what's the use of being "not boring", if I can't have a serious heart to heart talk with you.
    Fun is usually in the moment and it can be across layer of existence. Mostly preyas but has advantages of mindfulness.
        Seriousness is usually shreyas in the long run thinking and not being dissuaded by short term rewards.
        We need a life which has both short term entertainment without compromising our long term interests.
        We drive the car for a destination but enjoy the journey. Enjoying journey is fun but reaching destination is seriousness.
        Simplest answer to that claim is what's the use of sitting in 1st class apartment if the train does not reach destination.
        This statement captures the balance between shreyas and preyas aptly.
        Some believe reach destination even if stay miserable thru journey - that's not good.
        Some believe that enjoy the journey even if you reach a place that you didn't want - that's not good either.
        The balance wins.
IQ - Good quality of Ashok that he is always open to good ideas coming from anywhere to improve things.   
PIES - Most important
    About
        The real problem is that our goals are not high enough. We get whatever little goals we set.
        As a man thinketh, so learn to think high.
        We have to target goals that are in our reach or Circle of influence.
        We know that Spiritual world is highest prayojan (actually helping others in their perfection is still higher)
        This is COC and getting it is beyond our COI
        what's in our hand is tapasya for the same but we also wanna checkpoint our progress.
        So there are stages of perfection as per 4 high level ashrams that we should strive for
        this is mainly from avaroh pantha but relatable in aaroh pantha
            we will use all the guidance in avaroh and aaroh for the following goals.
            avaroh on other levels of perfection is application of same at smaller granularity tiers
            it's important to not get stuck at any particular but traverse thru it for perfection.
            aaroh can come from self help authors, experiences, successful idolizing, science, logical thinking, exploring social systems, etc.
    Prayojan - In terms of SVAF, the following - 
        I want personal perfection
            Eg - spirituality and Foundation in attitude - being virtuous in qualities, etc.
            being highly effective
            in Varna I can do it all, In ashram, I consume everything.
            Abstract Idols - always making yourself better, people with regulated lifestyle.
        I want group (team/family) perfection
            Eg - spirituality and foundation in behavior - behavioral qualities and examplification.
            being great contributor
            in Varna we can do it all, In ashram, we consume it all.
            concerned with great coordinations in interest of some social goodness (but not specific best social interest)
                there are also impedance or resistance but those specific problems are just jnana and dhyan based problem solving.
            Abstract Idols - all awesome people around you (focus on positives of e1 around you)
        I want social perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in communication - being a spiritual or principles expert (or idol) and guiding so.
            dedicated to social welfare
            in varna, all of us do it all; In ashram, all of us consume it well as a culture.
            Abstract Idols - All great men of the past - the people who left legacy by the purpose which was bigger than themselves.
        I want universal perfection
            Eg - Spirituality and foundation in Devotion - becoming one with spirituality and principles.
            this is mystic and esoteric side of perfection
            In Varna - we align well to trans in work; In ashram - we align well to trans in enjoyment.
            Abstract Idols - acaryas, sages, God and avatars.

SQ - Arjuna
    Sympathize with Karna but e1 wants to be like Arjuna.
    Represents success, focus, prosperity, determination and stability.
    Sanjay after BG samvad says I become ecstatic thinking about it - 2nd hand knowledge.

        Arjuna is historical personality but also principle.
        SP - Arjuna and Kunti are eternal associate of Krishna.
